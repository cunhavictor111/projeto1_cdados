"In general good service, but we don't have much options for flights in Mexico. Staff service was friendly, entertainment service was fine but we don't have wifi onboard Aeromexico flights. The worst was the food and beverage service.",Passive
Delta will always be my first choice across the Atlantic and I have found them to be always even better than either BA or Virgin (who have themselves always provided excellent service). My latest flights were no exception. This is the second time I've flown from Heathrow to LAX in four months and both times the service has been great. Without doubt the friendliest cabin crew I have met the in-flight entertainment was good the food was okay and plentiful and the drinks and snacks kept coming. My first choice every time and whilst not the cheapest carrier it's certainly been the most reliable and pleasant to fly with.,Promoter
"I can confirm what has been reported earlier about British Airways long haul flights. Our plane was really old and most staff were almost the same. The TV screen was almost impossible to watch because of the distorted picture and the seats felt like on an IKEA couch from the 1970's. The usual food choice of ""pasta or chicken"" was reduced to chicken only. On top of that we were 24hrs delayed due to bad servicing of one of the engines which needed a spare part - only available in the UK. Disaster at the check-in counter when 400 travellers were asking for accomodation - British Airways had no strategy to handle such a situation which caused hours of unnecessary waiting in the queue. Hotel vouchers given for hotels that do not exist! We had to find a room for 4 (two small kids) on our own at almost midnight. This was definitely the last flight with British Airways.",Detractor
As a long time Continental customer and I really am trying to like United but they sure make it difficult. This is supposed to be an American company but they outsource customer service to India and Philippines with poor service to us customers. My flight from Narita to Newark Liberty was on a 777 that needs repairs and a good cleaning. My seat controls weren't working properly and the lavatories were dirty. Absolutely no amenities in the lavatories. I asked the flight staff for some soap and she gave me her own bacteria spray! For the cost of a business class ticket on this international flight you would think that United would provide what is standard on other airlines. The food was mediocre and no longer worthy of a business first pricing. All my other flights to Asia and around Asia were with Asiana and Bangkok Air. Amazing trips and outstanding service staff and amenities. Of the Star Alliance group United seems to be the only airline in the group charging outrageous prices and giving the customers barely basic services. I know all our USA airlines are the same lousy service but it sure does embarrass us with the rest of the world and I envy their far superior airlines. I took several 45 minute flights on Bangkok Air and would you believe they provided box breakfast/lunch with soft drink on each flight at no extra charge. And served and cleaned up over 100 passengers within the 45 minutes. It takes that long to get one drink sometimes with United.,Passive
"  I flew Air India from Newark to Mumbai and back this April. The flight from Newark left on time and landed in Mumbai before time (4.00 pm Indian time). The flight was nearly half empty and was smooth. However, the aircraft interior was very dull and not properly maintained. All three in-flight entertainment systems (including the two next to my seats) and their controls were not working. Seats were torn, and reading lights were also not working. Imagine how a person can survive such an ultra-long haul flight without any entertainment or reading! Many places, they put duct tape to cover the cracks below the entertainment system and tray. Just within three hours into the flight, the toilets were very smelly. The food was ok. However, the cabin crews were not professional and pleasant. They were taking so much rest in between for many hours without providing any service or refreshments. Same as the case with my return flight (AI 191), which was delayed by one hour to take off due to some technical issues.",Passive
We just completed round trip Toronto to Phoenix on AC Rouge - terrible! Seats are very small service is minimal boarding very slow because too much overhead baggage is allowed for first passengers on board. We stood in the jetway for more than 20 minutes waiting for staff to sort out baggage - unnecessary! Just enforce your own rules. A very poor alternative to reg. AC service. - bring it back please!,Detractor
" I'm a frequent traveller between Amsterdam and Bangkok, and use normally Qatar Airways. Due circumstances I had to fly now with Etihad. (25-04-2019, EY 401). My trip from Bangkok to Abu Dhabi was a real disaster. Concerning the airplane it was really bad, the seat are so hard and very small, maybe designed for gnomes. The audio/video system was very bad and outdated, moreover the choice of music was very poor (lots of arabic and unknown artists). The service experienced the on board was very bad, the crew were grumpy and not friendly. When I asked for a drink they didn't want to give me one, I had to wait for the food service. Arrived at Abu Dhabi airport and transport was by busses and then to queue for safety check, a big mess, so crowded and not organised. The airport itself was also a big mess, the area around the gate was too small. So for me it was once Etihad but never again. I will advise them to take note from Qatar or Emirates.",Detractor

After reading all the negative reviews about Gulf Air thought oh no here we go but I was pleasantly surprised. A330 from BKK to LHR (via Bahrain) all flights on time slightly larger seats as they are still flying the older A330 (which they are upgrading in August this year). Staff friendly and helpful plane was clean food was ok but not on a par with Emirates or Qatar. Entertainment system is old but all working all in all a good flight and at Â£200 cheaper than any of its competitors you get what you pay for will fly them again based on price and service.,Promoter
"  Sydney to Tokyo via Guangzhou. The crew are properly trained and care about what they are doing. Western passengers should be careful to avoid complicated questions as English skills are quite good, but not to conversational level. The food was a bonus, some of the best airline food I have had. There was a leek and potato soup that was just fantastic. Fish also to a very high standard. Wines were better than expected. Food choice was much better on Sydney to Guangzhou flight than flight departing Guangzhou. Lie flat seats on the A330 are comfortable and easy to use. A very good quilt and ammenities pack provided. The price of business class makes them affordable, plus Guangzhou is a good sector hub for Australia as it does away with the 14 hour leg to Europe.",Promoter
" New York to Pittsburgh operated by Delta. A nightmare. After 21-hour flying from Asia to JFK with my little kids, a 7 year and a 2 year old, we supposed to have only 3 hours layover at JFK and a 2 hour flight to get home. The last flight was delayed totally 12 hours including 1 hour in plane. The nightmare was, they extended the delay every hour and then every 20 minutes and they changed the gate for almost every time. We had to stay in the terminal, moved every time they extended the delay and changed gate. Our kids could not take a rest after 21 hours flying from Asia. They slept while sitting on the ground, in the crowd, in front of the gate to wait. I talked to Delta reps, they said ""sorry"" and turned their back. I did not see that they cared or felt sorry. It is the word they use to avoid troubles. It was not only our flight. Delta's terminal was a mess with many flights canceled, delayed, changed gate. We used to have problems with Delta. If there was another choice, we did not travel with Delta. Value for money - No. Cost to fly with Delta is not low. Ground service - Delta attendants are robots. They do not care. Seat comfort - small, narrow. Cabin staff service - The only thing they can do is to bring you water. Conclusion: very high price for very low cost flight.",Detractor

  Thumbs up to Kuwait Airways. We 5 passengers booked flights to and from Delhi to Frankfurt on 12th May and 23rd May respectively. The journey and food was excellent. The flight attendants and Inflight entertainment facilities were very good. Could improve by having wifi on board. Moreover the luggage allowance was good at 53 kgs (23 + 23 + 7).

"New York JFK to Munich in economy, from Munich to Zagreb upgraded for 115 U$ to business as wanted to have a lounge access for 3.5 hr layover in MUC. I had sports equipment with me which needed to be registered by phone in advance and that went smooth by knowledgeable and helpful agent. Mobile check-in using LH app was easy but luggage drop-off was a bit slow due a large passengers group checking in just before me. Refurbished and clean A340-600 with new IFE screens with good content, nice food and beverages, professional and welcoming crew who always give great service and make me feel like a guest, not only a passenger. On-time arrival in MUC, layover was spent in business lounge at H gates. Breakfast in the lounge was adequate with both hot and cold options, fruits, diary products, full bar and fast wifi internet. Clean and comfortable CRJ9 to Zagreb boarded from remote gate. Tasty and very nice presented brunch served for this 1h flight with 2 FAs checking am I happy with everything on the flight every time they pass by. I am impressed with consistency of Lufthansa on-board and ground services and gradual improvements made to remain competitive. If LH would make improvements in the Miles & More program and pricing to SE Asia as well they would be my carrier of choice not only on transatlantic routes.",Promoter

"  Kuala Lumpur to Paris and back via Doha in business class. You may experience some very minor hiccups or confusion on the ground, especially ex-Doha (e.g. I'm not sure why placing the correct luggage tag on my suitcase required a meeting of three ground staff - they never explained what the issue was. I got the impression that European travelers tend to receive colder treatment than others, but that is not exclusive to Doha airport. But once you're in the air, everything is wonderful. The crew treat you like an old friend. The service comes across as not only efficient and courteous but warm, sincere and lighthearted when the occasion calls for it. Well done.

"Traveling with 2 persons and 2 cats from Saint Petersburg to Santiago de Compostela in Spain for 590 Euro. The Vueling aircraft to depart at 6 am broke down at arrival in our departure aiport Saint petersburg in Russia. Staff had us leav main terminal area to hide us in back room terminal area at unused gate first. Then half an hour later we had to go all the way back an leave gate area altogether to check in counters, where we were told that plane would only depart at 4 pm, so 1 hours later, as a replacement crew and plane was being sent all the way from Spain. No food and beverage coupons were issued thn. People like us who stayd at private addresses in LED were told to travel back at pur own expense to those homes (1.5 hour away) and wait for a call to come back to airport later. Taxi costs would be reimbursed. Vueling offered fake alternative to cancel flight, but would only refund money two weeks later, which was useless at that moment of course. Despite requests to tell what woudl happen with connecting flights no staff member wanted to commit to anything but told us they would take care of them. Upon picking up luggage (complex operation) which was already in other area checked in and driving back far way to house, we got a call shortly after to return that flight would leave 3 hours earlier. Upon arrival at LED airport restaurant vouchers were issued but useless as flight would leave in less than an hour and restaurants were all booked. So we had no food since coupons can only be spent in restaurants. Plane still left half an hour late so in total 7.5 hour late and they were selling drinks and food on the plane instead of providing passengers with them for free for the inconvenience. No sense of redemption. Upon arrival in Barcelona the information given for where the counter for transits would be was wrong. Eventually we found the counter ad they confirmed the problem of getting cnecting flights and referred us to another counter with a waiting line. At that counter they told us there was no more connecting flight to SCQ (Santiago) , which any dim wit would know, so no news. They could only offer us a flight to an airport 1 1/2 hour away from Santiago (plus same distance from our home) plus bus transportation to Santiago or stay overnight in Barcelona (imagine, with 2 cats) in hotel and fly the next day direct. A restaurant coupon was given again, again useless as the flight would leave very soon. So we still had no food. We took the flight to the other city and on arrival there was no one to welcome us for the transfer to a cab or bus to Santiago, plus it was already very late. So we had to rent at our own expense an expensive car and had to cancel with costs our own prepaid 5 day rental in Santiago and drive our rental home instead of to Santiago. It all cost us 100s of Euros extra and of course the stress of an extra travel time of 11 hours, plus the extra time spent on returning a car rental the next days in a different far away town. Upon contacting Vueling about paying our costs, they refused to pay taxi costs and took zero responsibility saying they were not obliged to pay us anything (despite the laws saying opposite). We escalated it to a few passenger claim services. It seems we may succeed with one out of 3 of those to get what is due, but it will take a while. Never again with Vueling.",Detractor

" Denver to Salt Lake City. Our flight was canceled with no notification to us due to a payment not going through. It was confirmed to us that our only notification that our flight would be canceled was in small, light grey lettering at the very bottom of our email with the title confirmation saying â€œpayment pendingâ€. This was supposed to indicate that (although everything else looked like a normal confirmation with flight and seating information) our flight would be canceled with no further notification. They said â€œthis happens all the timeâ€ - basically too bad so sad. After a lot of pushback and over an hour on the phone, they gave us our original price of $50.

The worst economy flight I have had. The seat was good but the legroom wasn't. The IFE was very nice lots of German movies. Staff were awful. The flight FRA-DXB: Flight was 35 minutes delayed. After take off: Flight attendants went off for about 30 minutes! On our other flights: DXB-SGN: 3 hours delayed SGN-DXB: 1 hour delay. Staff were very slow.

"  Cancun to Los Angeles via Mexico City. This was the airline from hell.

My wife and I booked a round trip flight from New Orleans to Fort Lauderdale Florida to take a 20th Anniversary cruise on Carnival. I did take the time to read the information that Spirit publishes on their website so there were no surprises for us. Beginning with our arrival at the New Orleans airport their employees were all most courteous helpful and this extended throughout both the originating and return flights. Spirit sells you what you want and does not sell you what you don't want or need. We paid for the equivalent of first class seats as well as checked bags and still came out hundreds of dollars less than the cost of first class service on any other airline. Both flights were smooth and on time. The flight crews did a very good job of getting everyone on board and ready to go on time. We would not hesitate to fly them again. I'm thankful they offer the option of a-la- carte flying.,Promoter
" I am a regular customer of United Airlines, and my recent flight in March was in most part enjoyable, with a problem with a delay by weather to start my trip, in turn causing us to miss our connecting flight in Japan, but upon landing, it was announced to the passengers to look for the attendants of your connecting airline to get your rebooked flight ticket with another airline to continue your flight. Along with travel voucher to take us to Tokyo Haneda airport. My wife and I were quite relieved , thinking we would have to stay in Japan and rebook a flight next day (lost time and hassle of trying to reschedule our remaining travel.)

"Boarding for both sectors was done early and by groups. Air traffic control delays at Bogota meant a 25 minute delay arriving into Houston. This flight was operated with a Boeing 737-700 and was packed. Cabin crew were ok if not somewhat lackadaisical. Perhaps it was the midnight departure. Announcements were barely audible. For inflight entertainment, this plane was equipped with DirectTV rather than the airline's far superior wifi delivered personal device entertainment. This meant having to pay to view the only 8 movies available - as the rest of DirectTV's content library is inaccessible outside the continental USA. Big Fail. The cabin was uncomfortably warm throughout the flight and coupled with the older seats, tight pitch and full load made it far less pleasant and also difficult to catch any shut eye. Strangely, a full meal is served on this sector at about 1.30am, which to be honest, wasn't bad. Made me wonder why our outbound to Panama from Newark of a similar duration and more appropriate departure time for a meal service, offered no complimentary catering. The crew did a few water runs until arrival in Houston. Transfer at Houston took longer than I expected owing to slow immigration clearance. However, I boarded the next flight with ample time to settle in. This aircraft was a Boeing 737-900ER with the newer seats, sky interior and wifi delivered entertainment. What a difference. It just felt more spacious. Seats were a bit more comfortable and legroom seemed to be better. Perception is everything I guess. The crew this time were sunnier, cheerful and seemed pleased to be onboard. Pushback was right on time and arrival 18 minutes early. Service consisted of the usual morning beverages and a stroopwaffel. A second round of coffees and a couple of water runs were done as well. All with a smile. This last flight was clearly the best of 3 I took with United over the last 10 days. Pity both the shorter international sectors I experienced were not quite up to scratch and felt more like domestic runs. One thing I find United has excelled at is it's mobile app. In terms of accessible information, actual usability and integrated entertainment - I think it exceeds the capabilities of most other airlines.",Passive

The seats are basically the same as economy seats, they just don't sit someone in the middle seat, so no meaningful increase in legroom or width.

 Miami to Newark. I went against my better judgement in booking a round trip flight with them. This airline has by far the worst customer service I have encountered. They lack customer support and assistance when it comes to dealing with flight changes and cancellations over the phone.

"Business class on EK 418 BKK-SYD. The flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and I managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. An overall great flight but check-in at BKK and luggage return in SYD needs to be improved. Also not impressed with the EK Lounge in BKK.

"  Flew Los Angeles to Milan via Newark. What a horrible experience with United Airlines. This so called company is great at taking your money but if there is one bit of an issue, then you have to speak with a supposed customer service that is in the Philippines and all they do is say ""sorry, so sorry you have a bad opinion of us"".

" Geneva to Hong Kong via Beijing. It was the unbeatable price that made me book and try them. One of the myths is that the planes are old. That is true and you see it from the very beginning when boarding the plane. You go through business class and it looks basic as well, just the full flat seats that remind you of business class. Economy is worse, except the seat legroom which I found better than most of the European airlines when flying long haul. The entertainment system is old and has only 1-2 movies in English, and almost unusable. It responds 5 seconds after you've pressed the button (no touch screen), the image quality is bad and the sound even worse. I had to use my headphones in order to understand something. But, the choices of foreign (not Chinese) movies was big and I had some novelties from the US, there were many European movies, a Chilean one and so on, all of them translated into English. The series were lacking the usual suspects from the US so I had to stick with the movies. Even the Chinese ones were subtitled, so after all a good surprise. The flight attendants did everything to make our trip nice and although the knowledge on English is basic (really basic), they struggled to make us feel welcome and asked if we needed something. They provided a blanket for the 3h flight from PEK to HKG. The food was average, but better than some other better considered airlines. For breakfast there was a western style one offered with omelet, chicken sausage and hash browns which wasn't bad at all. When it comes to beverages, the tea was very good, coffee so and so, the juices were nice (orange, apple, tomato) and the beer and wines (Chinese brands) were awful. I only experienced a half an hour delay once, with 12 legs flown in 2 weeks with them, so big surprise, they also land 45 minutes before schedule. Connecting in Beijing is almost a nightmare, but I have survived, give that the connecting time was decent, though not to much in order to get bored. Bottom line, Air China succeeded to impress me. I was expecting the worst and I got a fairly good economy product, better than some other airlines which should be better. I would say, you should give it a try if the price is right.",Passive
LHR-Bilbao. Seats allocated at check-in. Inbound aircraft late and very late gate allocation in terminal 3 which was busy. Arrived at gate to find aircraft just on stand however boarding commenced very quickly. First impressions of aircraft extremely poor. Over 25 aisle armrests broken and removed with temporary tape visible and the carpet was virtually non existent with chewing gum marks all over the place. Toilets had not been cleaned or restocked with paperware and one toilet at the rear had temporary repairs. A very poor impression and even though this is a low cost carrier the fares are not low on this route due to lack of competition. It is also in codeshare with Iberia and presents a poor image of this company too. Service was efficient and friendly to those that wanted to purchase items. Little information with regard to delay of inbound aircraft and announcements unclear and with little confidence in speaking English. Sadly the poor aircraft appearance detracted from a very average experience.,Detractor
I have had a wonderful experience with Air India when I travelled on Delhi-Chicago. Although I was travelling Business it felt like travelling First Class. I appreciate the leg room which their seats provide. Food was very good with sufficient portions. Before travelling with AI I did heard a lot of noise about notorious Cabin crew of AI but my personal opinion is they are much better than Lufthansa United. For sure I would travel only AI now onwards.,Promoter
 Sydney to Melbourne with Qantas. I enjoyed the flight. Check in was very easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The meal served was very tasty and it was nice to have a glass of beer. My only complaint was the IFE. It is such a shame that we no longer have access to music on domestic flights. It makes a flight so much more enjoyable. There is no time on a 60-90 minute flight to watch a movie or even a TV show.,Passive
My 4th time transatlantic on Icelandair from Glasgow to Seattle. No complaints. The security process is nothing to do with Icelandair everything to do with EU.

I much prefer Icelandair to any other transatlantic carrier. Baggage allowance is great!,Promoter

"Liverpool to Palma return. Outward journey was fine: prompt departure, uneventful flight, efficient - if slightly low key - cabin crew, slightly early arrival. Return journey was delayed because the original incoming aircraft had had to be replaced, but easyJet did what it could to keep us informed. An agent came and waited at the gate for an hour or so to tell passengers of the delay and to provide updates, only leaving when the first of the proper boarding staff arrived. She had actually ended up trying to field more inquiries from passengers waiting at the next gate for a delayed shared Heathrow flight than from easyJet customers. From the time the plane finally arrived, boarding was very swiftly organised and completed in less than half an hour. The flight itself was uneventful and we made up a little time en route, eventually arriving about 90 minutes late. At no time had there been any significant fuss or complaint about the delay, probably because an effort was made to keep us informed.",Promoter
" Rome to Brindisi. I had never booked a flight with Ryanair so I wasn't aware that it was mandatory to check-in prior to arriving at the airport. They charged me a penalty of 121 euros for the two tickets! I didn't receive a text nor email telling me to do so to avoid the fee. I was told by the agent that I should have read the terms and conditions. The site stressed the fees for baggage during the booking but nothing was said of the necessity to check-in online to avoid the fee. If they want everyone to read the fine print, then don't say anything about the bags. I'll think twice before patronizing them in the future.",Detractor
"  Amritsar to Dubai via Doha. Flight from Amritsar to Doha on A321 which was well maintained and legroom was good. The boarding started an hour earlier but not done zone wise and took almost 30 minutes to board the plane. No greetings from crew when boarded. The A321 is full and it would be better, if they deploy a bigger aircraft. The flight attendants were just doing their job and not smiling. Refreshing towel pack handed out and menus were given. Drinks served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served out of Amritsar was not up to 5 star mark and very average dinner. Veg Biryani with one small teaspoon of lentils and tasted bland. Desert of Mango Kheer tasted better. The main course is small. No tea or coffee served after the meal and you have to ask for this. Inflight entertainment was good. But the touch screen option takes longer time to do the action assigned. The good thing about this flight is that it departed 10 minutes before time and reached 20 minutes ahead of its scheduled arrival time. On reaching Doha, bussed to the arrival hall which is just 5 minutes ride. As there is no other flight arrival quickly pass through security for transits and then straight to departure hall. Flight to Dubai on A321 was comfortable. Flight attendants were smiling, attentive and doing their job with passion. Considering it a 5 star airline, no water or welcome drink was served, but a hot snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight.

Bucharest (OTP) - Malta (MLA) return. Very good value for money I have travelled with them a lot of times and I'm very happy to say I consider their service quite good keeping in mind that this a ULLC airline. You get what you pay for if you don't need a checked-in bag or on-board catering you don't need to spend your money on it. I have not experienced any unreasonable delay although I have travelled with them 30+ times in the last couple of years. The FA's are nice and welcoming the boarding takes place fast thanks to the small cabin bag policy and none of the seats can be reclined. The ground services are good as they use the main airport in Bucharest (OTP). Smaller airports like Treviso or Cuneo can be crowded while you are waiting to board the aircraft but this compensates with faster security checks. My best flights were from Bucharest to Madrid Barcelona Ciampino Bergamo Eindhoven Charleroi Catania Malta and I will soon travel on the new flights to Malaga and Malmo.

"  Singapore to Sydney, late evening flight. Qantas has a reputation for its de-personalised service, giving a feeling of ""rush"", ""here-you-go"", ""it's-the-rules"", uptight services. It really does reflect ""Australian hospitality"" to certain extent. Products were lacklustre, boring interior, uncomfortable economy seat (cabin crews would give you a snare, ""you get what you paid"") and mention not, their boring meals. The passenger seating next to me was asking if he could have something extra as he was feeling hungry, classic answer, ""Sorry sir, I can't help you much. You should have brought your own food"".

My thanks to airline retrieving wrapping and delivering luggage to me when it did not make a connecting flight out of Dulles - also to the ground staff at OR Tambo who were courteous and reassuring to all of us. The food on that flight was awful and I am not a fussy eater. The food was served at local time 15h00 less than two hours before touch-down at OR Tambo and quite ridiculous as a lunch - especially since it was about 8 hours after breakfast. The cabin was darkened until that time (15h00) even though it had been daylight for hours. Surely one does not expect an 8-hour sleep after breakfast when we had already had about 4 or 5 hours after leaving Washington. Most ridiculous the out of date video that played before touchdown was long and complicated and did not even mention Gautrain.,Passive
Worst experience I've had with an airline. I thought I was getting a good deal for price but did not expect to be charged for carry-on's $50 a piece! So in the end flight is not cheaper than other airlines. In addition flight was cancelled in Chicago (flying from Oakland CA to Mlps MN). I ended up driving with 3 others on the Spirit flight from Chicago to MINN. We were told they would reimburse leg we did not take but have not heard anything from them regarding this and its been a week!

All I can say is thankfully this airline does not fly to Australia as if they did I probably would never fly again. Compared to Singapore and Cathay Pacific which I flew with as well on this trip there is no comparison. The staff on Swiss Air were extremely rude. I was informed that I was a vegetarian and I had ordered a special meal. When I said I hadn't they said there might not be a spare meal for me. This is in business class.

Overall ended up paying about 90.00 more than the original fare. May have been cheaper initially but by the time you add on these items it would be best to check other options. In addition, we had to check our bags but when you arrive at the airport in La Guardia the counter does not open until 7am no matter what time your flight is in the morning. Makes no sense to arrive early to stand in line to check our bags for a min of 30 minutes then you still have to go to TSA.

"Flew on a Norwegian flight to Haugesund, via Oslo, from Berlin. Had a 60 minute layover in Oslo. Trouble is, you have to personally walk your luggage through customs, then check it in again - once boarding starts, the baggage drop does not accept bags anymore. Thus, we were told we had to get rebooked, since we have to be on the same flight as our bags. At the counter we learned that we could be rebooked to a 22.00 flight - it was 14.25! We had booked a connection with a total travel time of 3.40 h - so, the delay of over 7 hours (for our 50 minute flight to Haugesund) effectively tripled our travel time. Staff were less than helpful in making the situation more comfortable for us - food vouchers were provided, at least. A place for my pregnant wife to rest? Fail. A place for our 15 month old toddler to nap? Fail. Getting a message to our relatives at Haugesund airport - who had no cell phone or internet connection at the cabin? Fail. All it would have taken on Norwegian's part was to have someone meet us at the other side of customs to receive our bags and direct us to our flight. It was 14.20 when we cleared customs, boarding had started 5 minutes earlier and departure was scheduled for 14.45 - Oslo has a family line for security that takes about 10 minutes, max - so we could have been at the gate by 14.35.

"  I had a mixed experience. I was flying economy with 3 others in my family from Chicago to Reykjavik. Pre-Paid 110 dollars to check a bag 2-way. I had 3 other carry-ons that I have taken on multiple flights with no issues. In Chicago, they said that 2 of my bags don't fit (as in the wheels were out by a half-inch.) But they were nice about it and let me check it in for free. On the way back, I had the misfortune of meeting an unfriendly agent. No name tag. Everyone was called an agent. He said that I have to check all 3 bags as the wheel was out by a half inch. They have a ridiculous sized box, and I was shocked that I have to pay 207 dollars more to check in 3 bags. I had a device to remove the wheels, and so I removed it. He said that it is not enough for it to go in I cannot push it in to fit, but it has to slide in without pressure. He got angry with me and said that I have to check in. My wife and kids were getting nervous, so I went to a different part to check in, and removed the wheels and showed it to another agent, who said that all 3 bags were fine. I still checked it in. This time for free as the bag was eligible as a carry on. They could have offered that to me. I assumed it wouldn't be a problem as the Chicago agent let me do that. Other than that, the agents in the plane were friendly. I could detect this agent's disgust and felt he was picking passenger to challenge.

The flights from JFK - Hong Kong - Siem Reap were fine and the amenities, provided. The flights from Ho Chi Minh to Hong Kong to JFK were awful. Cathay had a delay which caused me to miss my connecting flight. I was promised an upgrade by the gate agent because of the long wait I would have to endure.

They offered to provide a car in NY to transport me home which, after waiting an hour, they reneged on. However, the most disturbing issue is the advertising of amenities in ""premium"" economy: calf rests at the seat, separate check in and boarding lines and a champagne welcome. None of the amenities were provided. Other than being wider, the seat was no different than flying regular economy. The lines to check in and board were ridiculous and service aboard was awful. Attempts at resolving these issues have been met with a stubborn refusal to acknowledge that they did not provide a ""premium"" experience. Airline has no concern for customer satisfaction.

"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.",Detractor

Every single sandwich and snack has one type of cheese or another added even on the pre-order meals it's a choice of cheese or more cheese.

"  I flew from Baltimore Washington to Keflavik. WOW air offers cheap tickets if you are willing to skimp on the extras. Yes, they charge you for food, drinks (including water), a normal sized carry on, and checked bags. You can bring a free carry on but it has to be able to fit under the seat in front of you and they will check when you check in to make sure. This airline manages to keep prices low by not charging you for the extra frills. If you want them you can purchase them but it's at your discretion. I usually take an empty water bottle with and fill it up after I get through security to save on drinks. I also bring a sandwich bought at a convenience store. WOW air does not have entertainment on board which they do tell you on their website. You can pay to rent a tablet but it's easier to just bring your own. I brought my own e-reader and it worked out great! The airline attendants were very sweet and my seat was better than expected. The plane interior is very trendy looking and seats give you a decent amount of legroom. To be honest I think I had better leg room on my flights with WOW air than with American Air or United. One of my flights even had power outlets under the seats. Be aware there is no wifi on their flights so download movies prior. Overall great flight! Just be aware of what the regulations are. They have all of their information on the website.",Promoter

Drinks were also good and there was a good selection of them. Flight crew were also friendly and both flights arrived a little bit early.

"  New York to Chiang Mai return via Singapore booked for March 2017. Days after making the reservation well in advance (through Orbitz), I was notified of a minor change in schedule. No problem. A couple of days later I received another change, this one a 22 hour flight delay requiring almost a full extra day of travel spent in Singapore. Singapore Airlines policy gave me these choices: Accept the change (ridiculous), or provide them with 3 alternatives in order of preference. They then choose which one you will fly. The passenger cannot choose and have that choice confirmed. Or cancel the ticket (full refund) and start over. In this case, no other same-day flight Singapore to Chiang Mai was available, so the alternatives reduced to an extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 2 hours, or extra connecting flight through Bangkok, losing 4 hours, or connection through Hong Kong and losing approximately 15 hours in transit. But if you say okay to these choices ""you could end up with any one of them"", and all are inferior to the original reservation. I cancelled, and will not be booking this airline again.

I spotted an excellent deal for a Business Class return London Heathrow to Auckland at 2500 GBP so I decided to pay family in NZ a quick visit. The legs between London and Guangzhou were served by 787 and the Guangzhou Auckland legs by 777-300ER. The 787 has lie flat seats in pairs perfectly comfortable for sleeping but there did seem to be some issues with the operation of some seats and cabin crew seemed quite familiar with dismantling and fiddling with the mechanisms. Possibly not the sturdiest of kit. The 777 seats were of more substantial build with singles at the windows and pairs in the middle. The Sky Team lounge in Heathrow was lovely the China Southern lounge in Guangzhou was what one expects in China shiny of the surface but a bit rickety underneath only two showers and some confusion as to the booking procedure little food cheap wine etc.. However it did the job OK. Cabin crew were lovely if not occasionally disorganised I had requested vegetarian meals which only appeared on 3 of the 4 sectors and on those that it did appear bits of it seemed to be offered to other passengers in error leaving me with one meal consisting only of a main course. Not great but If you're familiar with China then you'll cope fine with it all. Would I fly with them again? Yes if the price differential is large enough but if they try to charge the same as the other major players on the route then probably not.,Passive

"  Bangkok to London via Beijing. Absolutely shocking service from Air China. while the inflight experience is not good, this is nothing in comparison to what I've experienced since leaving the aircraft. First of all my luggage was left behind in Beijing. No big deal - this happens with all airlines. What's terrible is how Air China resolved this, or rather didn't. After chasing them many, many times over email (with up to two weeks passing between replied from their customer service team), they finally agreed to pay me the due compensation of Â£46. Great, I thought, a resolution. But when the envelope finally arrives through the post, I find it contains not a cheque but a voucher for travel with Air China. As I have NO intention to ever fly Air China again, I find this next to worthless. Reading back through my emails I now find (of course) that Air China did make one very discreet reference to a 'TCV' (or Travel Compensation Voucher). I think it's disgusting that they use a jargon-y acronym to hide their true intentions. The whole experience reeks of complete disregard for the customers that keep their shoddy business afloat and I would recommend that you avoid this airline.

" Ft Lauderdale to Baltimore. 1:06 am I called airline regarding an email that stated flight was delayed to 5:30. Response was crew was ill. I arrived early but almost missed flight because another email was sent moving flight back to 5:09. Flight was boarded but delayed because pilot was still running late. Arrived just after 7am and crew and pilot announced that flights were being held that were the connecting flights. We ran to gate E8 and when we arrived at 7:20am they were just closing the door and wouldn't allow us to board even though the crew said they would wait. The desk attendant told us she could get us on a flight out of Orlando and that if we didn't run to gate G8 we would miss that one too. We ran back to gate G8 and they were still missing but said we weren't on the manifest. We were told to go to customer service to be added. We did so and they said corporate already moved us out on a 4:35 flight. We were told that if we wanted something sooner we needed to exit the terminal and go to the ticket desk. I spoke with an agent and she said there was nothing she could do, that this was the soonest flight available. I explained to her all the issues with her staff and the lies that were laid upon us. In all my years of flying I have never experienced such chaos. This is unacceptable management. There was no reason that the gate door couldn't have been opened to let us last 6 passengers on board unless your airline overbooked it. Not only are we now 10 hrs behind schedule now but the arrangements that have to be made are expensive and time consuming. I believe that your customer service is in need of some serious modifications and that our 4 tickets should be comped due to your staffs inability to provide the customer service we deserved.",Detractor

"â Unverified | Never had flown them before a week-long trip to Iceland. Initially thought I'd been thrown into time warp of flying Pan Am, with flight attendants dressed up, wearing pill box hats, tons of make up and high heels. But that's where the service ended. I'd been told by friends that Iceland people tend to be more reserved, and found this to be true with the flight attendants. There was no warmth or helpfulness, just a perfunctory manner of handing out the drinks in a somewhat cool and detached manner. It is somewhat surprising to be on an 8-hour flight and receive only a soft drink, not even a meal or a snack. I can't think of another airlines who doesn't serve complimentary food on a flight that long. We didn't even get peanuts or pretzels. Also, the seats are very uncomfortably hard for such a long flight. I found myself trying to stretch just to keep my back side from going numb.

"  Goa to London via Mumbai. We flew air India on the 12/13th February 2017 initially from Goa to Mumbai. The flight was delayed to Mumbai by 30 minutes, then we were told the flight would be 1 hour delayed, in the end the flight was delayed by over 3 hours resulting in our connecting flight on Jet Airways being missed back to the UK. The whole experience was handled very poorly by the ground staff at Goa, there were no announcements regarding the reason why or any updates. After 2 hours, more passengers started to arrive for the later flight so it was obvious that the two flights were being combined. On arrival and at check in, we were handed boarding passes with a capital D printed on the boarding pass, indicating delayed but the new arrivals were issued regular boarding passes. As it turned out, we departed Goa at 01.30 on the 12th February, we knew by this stage that the connecting flight was not possible. On our arrival at Mumbai we were left to our own devices with Air India totally washing their hands of our situation. The ground staff were aggressive, dismissive, rude and generally not getting involved. At one point we were sent to the customer information desk in the airport, it was not an Air India information desk, just a general desk for airport services. Jet Airways would have nothing to do with us either, blaming the other airline, (this will be another review). We ended up buying 2 new tickets on Air India to Birmingham via Delhi, (it was the only flight out that morning,) would you believe it but this flight was delayed by 2.5hrs so we missed our connecting flight once again. We were offered the next flight out to London Heathrow, we had boarding passes issued, collected our luggage, checked in again and rushed to the departure gate, managed to get on the plane and would you believe: we were delayed by another 2 hours. It appears this is a very common everyday issue for this airline. On my return to the UK, I was informed by other travellers that the exact same delay occurred on the Friday night. The flight was not the best, an old Boeing 777, dirty interior, absolutely filthy toilets that smelled terrible. The inflight entertainment system on our seats stopped working after 40 minutes, this happened on 2 occasions so we were not able to watch anything in full, not even the shorter programs. My only praise for this whole experience were the cabin crew on this leg from Delhi to Heathrow, they were jolly, chatty and polite. Since my return, I have tried to contact Air India numerous times for a delayed flight certificate, but with no reply. I'm not sure if they have any customer support in the UK but if they do, they dont want to be found. I was told to travel to Heathrow to Air India ticket office to collect the certificate. 500 miles round trip from my home, I dont think that will happen. So my overall view of Air India is not a good one, I personally would not fly them again unless there were no other carrier's flying to that particular airport. One piece of advice, if your flying to join another flight in Mumbai please give yourself ample time at least 6 hours if not more just in case of delays.",Detractor

There is always a snack and on international routes a proper sandwich which makes a difference with for example BA or Air France where they still serve lousy crackers on international (European) services. 3) The cabin crew are lovely has humour and also treats Economy Customers as important guests.,Promoter

Meanwhile the weather outside is getting worse and worse. So now we board at 4pm. They had us sit on the airplane for another 3 hours before we actually took off. 200+ people missed a whole day of vacation time. Updates were very infrequent. To top it all off the flight crew were miserable. They were finally walking by to offer us some food but a) they ran out of everything and b) they walked right by our row without asking. When I waved my hand the attendant got annoyed with me. It was the last time I fly with Air Canada. The free food was a sandwich. The drinks - they gave you pop juice or water and you couldn't have an actual can. Inflight entertainment - forget it. They didn't play a movie on the way to Montego Bay. You had to have the app downloaded on your phone. If you didn't have the app you got nothing.,Detractor
"I've flown transatlantic on Air Canada twice this year, both less then ideal experiences. For my flight from Calgary to Munich there was a promotion to check ski bags for free for flights to Europe. Upon arriving at the airport, I was told I would have to pay $100 because by bag was over 50lbs and the promotion only applied to those under this weight. Once I got my boarding pass, I found that I was not seated in the window seat that I had previously booked. This was also the case for my flight from Toronto to Munich, as I had booked beside my friend flying from another city for that flight and we were at opposite ends of the plane. Then we sat at the gate in Calgary for over an hour once boarding was completed with no reasonable explanation for the delay - thankfully I had a 5 hour layover. I am a loyal customer to Air Canada and Star Alliance and I choose to fly with them above other airlines, but experiences like this that make me question my loyalty.",Detractor
"  Buenos Aires to Dubai via Rio de Janeiro. Perfect flight in Emirates First Class. This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home. An outstanding flight experience and actually good value for money, considering the reasonable price paid. Highly recommended.",Promoter
"Expecting a great deal based on other reviews we decided to pay more to fly with Emirates from Dubai to London Heathrow. Unhelpful Emirates Staff at Heathrow - could barely muster a smile. Completely oversold their family friendly service. It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way. They are clearly more important than you. The toilets were not maintained. I have always flown with Virgin in the past and will continue to do so in the future.",Detractor
We arrive at STL airport to find that we are a minute late to be able to check our baggage. They then schedule us on the next flight which means we now have a layover and will be getting to our destination two hours late. After waiting for our new flight to board we are notified that our flight is late and we will have to take a different flight now which will make us now another hour late on top of the other two hour delay. To top it all off they didn't have two seats available together and not once did a staff member apologize.,Detractor
"  Great airline. I had 3 domestic flights with Indigo: Udaipur-Mumbai, Mumbai-Goa and Goa-Delhi. Booking in its website was easy and prices were competetive. Check-in at the airports was easy and fast - Indigo had many counters open in all 3 airports. Flights departured with no delays of more than 5 minutes. The airplanes looked new and very clean. Staff was nice and helpful. On two occasions I ordered a sandwich (about 250 rupees) which was quiet tasty to my surprise. The only downside that I can think of is that the seats are not very comfortable, but it's a low cost airline and flights usually last only 1-2 hours, so it's not such a big deal. Highly recommended.",Promoter
"In December 2013 I flew London to Brusssels with my thirteen year old son, using two different booking references since he was subsequently returning to London and I was not. Our plane was at first delayed and then we were allowed to board. We sat in the plane for almost two hours without the taking off. During this time we were not allowed to use the lavatories or being served anything to drink or eat before finally being told that everybody had to disembark due to technical problems with the plane, and that everybody would be put on various different other planes to get us to Brussels. Given that the plane was full I queried that we would all fit in on that day's remaining flights since this was already quite late in the evening due to the long wait. I was told not to worry. Some people were then given changed boarding passes and were told to transfer to another aircraft. We did not get any new boarding passes and we came to the aircraft there were no more places on it. We were told that we had to go to a hotel in London for the night. My teenage son who had his own booking reference was told the same. Nobody seemed to query that it might not be suitable for thirteen year old to spend the night alone in a hotel in London and whether he would be capable of finding his own way back to the airport the day after. I insisted that we had to be on the last plane leaving for Brussels since I was injured and on crutches and had difficulty moving about and since we had to be in Brussels that evening. Finally they took somebody else's boarding pass and gave them to us instead, not even changing the names on the passes. This meant that some other people would have been forced off the flight. This procedure is totally against all rules since everybody should be given a chance to elect to stay behind against compensation, and the airline staff should not randomly select who gets to board and who does not. When my son was about to return to London after the holidays, his booking had disappeared and when I called the customer service I was told that his return flight had been automatically deleted since he never boarded the flight from London to Brussels and the system then deleted the return flight. When I informed them he had in fact boarded that flight but that the flight never left due to technical problems and we had to be put another flight they at first did not believe me. Finally they reluctantly and without any type of servicemindedness grumpily agreed to reinstate him on the return flight against a rebooking fee. When I queried this fee they finally gave in and waived the rebooking fee. After this a filed a complaint with their customer service and got an automatic message saying that I would be informed of the result after two week. This was almost two years ago and I am still waiting for any type of response from Brussels Airlines.",Detractor
"  Bangkok to London with British Airways. I'm a frequent flyer. For a change, we decided to fly BA to London from Thailand for our 12 hour journey. When we were seated, we realized that the seat cushion was coming away. Underneath there were lots of litter. We then realized that we can't watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound. I informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc. Our other complaint was the food - it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times. In short I would not recommend flying with BA.",Detractor
"  Flew Hong Kong to Vancouver. First opportunity to fly the new Cathay Pacific A350 preceeded by a very relaxing and enjoyable stay in the CX lounge. The airplane, cabin and new PE seating didn't disappoint. The larger windows and cabin height makes for a much more spacious feel and the new PE seating are not that far short of regional business class. Only complaint would be that the food service times were a little funky with two main meals being served during this day time long haul flight. Both were of good quality and enjoyable however. Friendly and efficient cabin crew made for a great flight. Didnt try the inflight WiFi.",Promoter
" Dallas to New York JFK. After working nonstop to be able to fly for New Years to see my family and friends. I was meeting a friend in NY for a day and a half to spend there.

" New York to Hong Kong via Shanghai. I have to say I was motivated to write this review in large part due to the generally negative reviews I had read on China Eastern prior to taking my first flight. These reviews are so negative I almost cancelled my booking to use Avios points on Cathay. However on actually flying them I was truly impressed by the flight. The seat is excellent and felt the same as the one I had flown on in Air France recently (also excellent). I managed 9 hours of sleep, a record for me. The service was professional if a little robotic although the FA constantly checked if I needed anything else during meal service. Once meal service was done the FAs pretty much disappeared until breakfast although there was a self service food station left out. Entertainment system was limited but that's my only negative.",Passive

Darwin to Adelaide. Upgraded to Business using points for this Saturday afternoon flight. The attention and service is very nice bigger seats and plenty of legroom but I feel somewhat let down by the catering. It's very nice to have a gin and tonic for a pre lunch drink but do I need the pretzels they also serve in economy. There were only two mains offered a hot and cold option hot being duck which I don't eat and the cold being couscous. The meal was nice enough but expect a bit more for Business Class. A warm bread roll and small bowl of fruit made up the meal and later Maggie Beer ice cream. A beautiful Riesling was served throughout the meal while partner opted for red and assured me that both were extremely good labels. While the overall experience is very nice I would like that little bit extra in Business food wise that distinguishes it from Economy. Perhaps because the economy product is generally very good is the problem - after all you get cheese and crackers on some flights a hot meal and ice cream too. Overall enjoyable experience.,Promoter
"Birmingham to Budapest via Frankfurt. Pleasantly surprised with Lufthansa for this trip. I had been regretting booking with them following the recent strikes, but thankfully this was resolved a couple of weeks before our trip. Planes clean and tidy, all crew pleasant and a small snack of half a sandwich and one round of drinks served on each flight. Definitely worth the small extra price over the low cost carrier on this route. The only issue for us was the 45 minute transfer in Frankfurt wasn't enough, we parked remotely and were taken by bus to the terminal which took a surprising amount of time, we then had to clear security again and run to the gate just making the flight. The gate agent was just closing the flight and said she was surprised that we had made it. If this was the case why did Lufthansa book us such a short connection?",Promoter

"  Roundtrip Seattle to Keflavik in May/June 2016 in Saga Class, Icelandair's business class. At SEA the check-in was smooth. Icelandair does not participate in priority lane privileges and so I had to go through the regular line for security screening. The SEA-KEF flight was an old worn-out 757 named Askja (after an Icelandic caldera). The interiors were shockingly shabby and dirty. In the Saga Class cabin there were panels peeling off from the ceiling (see attached photos). The spaces around the seat and in the tray receptacle had scraps of food and dirt in it, the bathrooms were grimy. Wifi didn't work. The onboard staff was very nice, food was good but vegetarians have limited options. The return KEF-SEA flight was on a 757-200 named SnÃ¦fell which was in much better condition than the Askja aircraft. Icelandair has a pleasant lounge at KeflavÃ­k airport and the breakfast offerings were copious. Saga Class passengers have no boarding priority at KeflavÃ­k which is a real shame. Again, the onboard staff was outstanding. Icelandair Saga Class is woefully behind the times. The aircraft are very old and in dire need of replacement. The premier product is not worth the money.",Detractor

"  Garuda's Hard Product is pretty good by Economy Class standards. Heathrow â€“ Singapore via Jakarta. Flight ex-Heathrow was a 777-300ER. Online Check In allowed me to select my seat but not to print my boarding pass. Baggage Allowance was a very generous 30kg. On time departure, aircraft appeared to be about 70% full. The seats were reasonably comfortable and leg room was good by economy class standards. Seating configuration was 3-3-3 which is better than offered by many other 777 operators. On demand entertainment system with a reasonable selection of films and music (a good proportion aimed at Asian tastes). The movies weren't generally as current as some other long haul airlines and the menu system could have organised both movies and music more effectively for ease of navigation but there were enough of both to keep me occupied. Two hot meals served â€“ Dinner and Breakfast â€“ each with two options, Western and Asian. The meals were nothing at all special, standard economy class fodder really, although a printed menu was provided which was a nice touch and there were a couple of hot snack runs between the main meals. Crew were polite and reasonably visible throughout, although some of the cabin announcements were in such heavily accented English that it wasn't always easy to understand. Connecting flight from Jakarta on a 737-800. Flight time was just 1 hour 20 minutes but impressively there was still a hot meal and full drinks service. Less impressively, I asked a stewardess whether there were any embarkation cards for Singapore but she just looked baffled and said she would be back in a moment. She never returned. Return direct Singapore - London again on a 777-300ER and again with only partly functional online check in. Departure was on time and seating configuration, occupancy, IFE pretty much the same as the outward leg. Once again, two hot meals en-route, although the only option for second meal was fish. The â€œhot snackâ€ served between meals turned out to be a cold filled roll, and when I asked for a refill of coffee the stewardess seemed genuinely surprised and I was given just a quarter of a cup which turned out to be lukewarm. Garuda's â€˜Hard Product' is actually pretty good by Economy Class standards, but I get the feeling that service and catering standards have slipped a bit in recent years.",Passive

MEL-SIN return. Usually travel Business Class but tried Economy on this short trip. Overall impression was pretty good. Both flights were almost full but the crews were friendly and helpful and food service was quite slow but quality of the food was reasonable. Had a strange experience with the inflight entertainment system on both flights an English Language film suddenly lapsed into a version dubbed into some oriental language. Eventually reset by repeated switches out of the video system. Selection of films etc was OK but not comparable to Emirates product. One criticism is that the IFE was switched off 40 minutes before landing on the Singapore leg (A380). On the return trip it was switched off 20 minutes before landing. Seems ungenerous and not my experience on other airlines. A FA on the Melbourne flight also asked me to remove my noise-cancelling headphones for landing - also a new experience! Online check-in was difficult because of website problems but managed it in the end and subsequent check-in at Melbourne was very quick. Unable to check-in online for return trip due to more website problems but the standard check-in system at Changi was just excellent. Better than some Business Class check-in processes in fact.,Promoter
Bangkok Airways is my carrier of choice between CNX and BKK. I recently came back to from Guangzhou and needed a ticket to CNX. I had expected to have to fly with Air Asia but checked the price with PG first. I was offered a seat on the new late flight at the same cheap webfare I had seen online while in china. At last a carrier that actually wants and appreciates your business. I was able to spend several comfortable hours in domestic lounge read up on the news about Thailand check email and unwind after a fairly long day that far. Travelling again next week and managed to get the same webfare through an appointed agent in Chiang Mai for the leg down to BKK. Also glad to see that the dreadful cold chicken burger has been binned for something more edible. Cheaper than TG and worth the extra over flying the unreliable Air Asia.,Promoter
" Dubai to Trivandrum. I am writing this to bring it to your attention about an experience happened to me and my brother while we are travelling. We went to India on 9th of Feb 2018 and our final destination was Trivandrum. We were occupying 19th row seats. After take off, may be after 1.30 mins my brother went to toilet and fainted and fell down due to some health issues. He is a diabetic and Blood pressure patient. Suddenly crew members with the help of other passengers given him some water and Juices. He seems to be ok for the next 30 mins. After that he told me that he is not feeling well. Suddenly he went to the backside toilet and on his way it self he started vomiting. Some fellow passengers also got disturbed and i was the one who was cleaning all this. I really dont care as he is my brother. The issue happened afterwards, as he was requesting to lay down and they offered him a seat in business class for 10 mins. He was taken to the business class and i approached the attendant who was there to allow him to stay there as I can see half of the business class seats were empty. But he said that its full and I told him that i am ready to pay as i cant keep him there in that situation. There was only 1 hour 30 minutes remaining for landing and he asked me whether you want to pay for this. I said if you allows him to stay back then its fine then he said no. Then i agreed to pay the cost of 2200 AED which was collected from my card after 15 mins. After this I went to check my brother and he was asking me to keep the passenger who was sitting with us in business class so that he can lay down in my lap. So he was taking rest in my lap having issues to do proper breathing. After landing we arranged the airport doctor and took directly to the hospital. Here i would like to raise some points, what help you are offering if their is any emergency situation like this. If that person is not well at all, at least a courtesy to keep in a comfy place were he can get some rest. I know that staff have incentives for upgrades and up selling but you need to educate your staffs not to use their up selling skills at an emergency. Today this happened to me and my brother and tomorrow to anyone else. I am not disputing for the payment which i have done as he took the payment with all my permission. I don't think anyone will think about the money when your brother in that condition. In my past 12 years experience in hospitality i have gone through lots of emergency situations, but me or my management never thought of looting customers at that time. I made an official complain regarding this and after 16 long days, i just received a reply from them saying that sorry to inform that we are not able to refund your money.",Detractor

"Horrible flight from Vancouver to Boston via Dallas. Worst ever. When I got our boarding passes in Vancouver, the seats I paid $75 extra each for in row 8 were not the ones I was given, even though I had the confirmation. When I asked the girl at the American Airlines desk she couldn't help me and said to ask in Dallas. I called customer service, they still had me listed in row 8, not in row 17 and 16 (my son and I weren't even together now), then my wallet app ticket updated so I called customer service again - they still had us in row 8. In Dallas we were stuck with rows 17 and 16, not the seats I paid for, and then found out how difficult it is to get a refund for something that is clearly their fault. We got to Boston at 12:37am and our 4 bags, two suitcases and two ski bags didn't make it. The woman at the counter was rude. I reviewed a call in the morning saying my two ski bags made it and would be delivered by 2pm (I should mention my son was going back to college the next day) but they didn't know where my other two bags were and I was told to call back in a bit. I call back and my two bags were still in Texas and they ""hoped"" they would be here on the 3 pm flight. I called the 800 number quite a few times trying to get a straight answer and was told different things each time. Finally around 5pm I was told my other two bags had made it to Boston. I called to see where my ski bags were as it was past 2 and no bags yet. I was told they didn't make it to Boston until 2 so how could they be promised to be here by then I was told. Finally the driver called and said he'd have my ski bags here by 11pm! I never heard about the delivery of my other two bags so I called once again, got told they would ""rush"" the delivery as 4 hours later they were still at the airport - finally I got an email saying the delivery has started. The ski bags arrived close to 11 and the other two bags about 10 min later. What a hellish experience. We had to waste my sons last day home for winter break waiting for suitcases that didn't come when we were told, and I made hours of phone calls and was given a run around. I am confident had I not called and kept after my bags, they'd still be out there. Horrible customer service and they lie. I will do my best to never fly this airline again.",Detractor

Took AA on a trip to Spain. En route two of my three flights were delayed almost causing me to miss a connection and my baggage was lost - not sure if by American or one of the affiliated carriers. The worst was yet to come however. My flight from Madrid to NYC was delayed by a couple hours and so I was rebooked for my connecting flight. I wish I'd insisted on catching it since it was delayed anyway because what transpired after was unbelievable. The rebooked flight to DC was eventually canceled. We sat on the tarmac for 2.5 hours as maintenance repaired a broken chair then a door and then we lost our slot in the queue and had to wait awhile and then my home airport suspended flights coming and going due to weather. Finally the pilot took us back to the gate and told us our flight was canceled. 4 hours on the tarmac that day. Service to rebook flights was slow and some agents were a bit snippy. Slept at the gate overnight for my early flight the next morning. Had a bad feeling when I saw people arriving through the same gate 15 minutes prior to our scheduled boarding time. Sure enough we sat there for well over an hour as the tyre on the plane was being changed and then the flight was canceled. Exasperated I asked for a flight out of LaGuardia instead and although it was delayed on the runway I eventually got home after four bookings from NYC to DC. Very tight seat arrangement on the planes flying back (because they were older). Food wasn't bad and service on all the planes was overall pretty good. Service at the gate ranged from very solicitous to brusque. The airline seems to schedule flights too close together. On top of that the planes on my return trip were all old and shoddy hence the delays. So I ended up being booked for eight flights round trip when I was originally scheduled for just five. Seven of eight were delayed and two of those led to cancellations. American didn't do much to compensate me for the inconvenience either. I will never fly AA again.,Detractor
"Just arrived in London from Chicago after being away with my family on vacation in the States. We flew out with Air Canada and flew back in with United Airlines. The United Airlines aircraft was really dated, shocked when we entered the plane. The inflight entertainment I rate 1/10, the food served I rate 3/10. The flight itself was smooth but overall we were not impressed at all. The children had a good experience with Air Canada, they were able to charge their phones on the flight, Air Canada inflight entertainment was also very good. Our conclusion is that we won't fly United Airlines again after today's experience. Good luck to whoever does!",Detractor
"PVD-BWI-DTW-BWI-PVD Outbound legs to Detroit uneventful and handled with Southwest efficiency. Return legs were problematic as there was a line of severe thunderstorms over Baltimore causing severe scheduling problems for one of the major hubs for Southwest. Southwest came through and got us back to Providence, albeit two hours late. The terminal monitors in Detroit kept us well informed of delays and the Southwest app (although a bit slow in updating) did also. For the people who complain about the boarding methodology of Southwest, it is a bit strange for the uninitiated, but it works and has worked successfully for many years. If you insist on assigned seating, don't fly Southwest - simple as that. It is an airline that admittedly has its foibles, but even with that it is still an excellent product! .",Promoter
"  I flew London Heathrow to Paris Charles de Gaulle with Air France on the new Boeing 787. This aircraft is being used on one of the daily rotations between the cities.

It's worth noting that unlike British Airways penny pinching, Air France still give hot drinks, water and a snack free. Crew very good.",Promoter
" I was flying from Copenhagen to Saint Petersburg via Moscow. With all flights on the route being served by Aeroflot. I had only 75 minutes to change in Sheremetyevo. Why do you let the booking systems to sell the tickets with such a small time to connect. It's barely enough if the flight is on time - but, in my case, the Aeroflot flight from Copenhagen was delayed by 25 minutes. I have to say a few words about the official ground representatives of Aeroflot in Copenhagen. It was hustle and bustle, with lots of unnecessary movements. They made an impression of low professionalism. So the flight from Copenhagen departed with 25 minutes delay. The cabin crew on the flight CPH-SVO was also very hectic. I asked for a coffee and they poured me a warm liquid which barely resembles coffee. When I've told the lady about it and asked for the tea (if it's warm) I was met with very unfriendly face. The food had become very poor lately. I missed my connection to Saint Petersburg, I was rebooked for the next time, but barely had time to catch it. So if you travel via Moscow's Sheremetyevo you have to have at least two hours for the transfer. I arrived in Saint Petersburg's Pulkovo airport with the next Aeroflot's flight, but my luggage didn't, it arrived two flight later almost at midnight. The ground service of Pulkovo airport offered me to wait for my luggage two and a half hours. They offered me to fill in some papers and lied that if I will put 24 hours contact permission, it will simply mean, that they will have a right to send me sms 24/7, in fact, I later figured out that it meant that they can deliver my luggage 24/7. The next day I call to Pulkovo luggage service to ask about my luggage delivery, and they inform me that I will only get it from 20:00 to 8:00, at night. So I took a taxi and came to Pulkovo myself and picked up my luggage. Aeroflot didn't compensate the money I've spent on a taxi.",Detractor
I flew JFK-CMN many years ago and boarding was chaotic and disorganized. People ran to the counter in a stampede there was pushing and shoving. I stayed in my seat in the lounge until the crowd had boarded. I couldn't understand this as all had assigned seats. Years later boarding was much more civil and rows were called. I must add however that the airline food was excellent despite the 6 hour delay at JFK. Given a food voucher however still ended up paying approx 5 USD extra because the voucher was inadequate for the price of food at JFK.,Detractor
"Chicago to Minneapolis with Spirit Airlines. They cancelled my flight on the 4th July, citing ""weather problems"". The weather at my city of departure, and city of arrival was slightly cloudy with no storms, and no other airlines cancelled flights from ORD TO MSP. After driving to the airport to speak to an agent, I was told I could either fly out on the next available flight, or receive a refund. The next available flight was in 2 days. I asked if it would be possible to get placed on the least expensive flight from another airline, and was told ""Spirit doesn't do that"". So, I requested a refund, and received well under half of my round-trip ticket fair. Being Independence Day, there wasn't a single plane ticket for less than $320. I had to foot the bill for a $160 ticket at 7AM the next morning.",Detractor
BNE-SIN-ICN and return on Economy. Consistently great service in all four flights the cabin crew were very attentive. Food and drinks were excellent in generous servings and the movie selection on IFE is more than acceptable. I always love their signature cocktail Singapore Sling. The seat was a lot more spacious than I expected after having flown with other airlines in the US the month before. I thoroughly enjoyed all flights although having an empty seat next to me in all 4 flights might be one of the key contributing factors. I am a frequent flyer and I have to say this trip is one of the best I have had.,Promoter

Checked in on the web as well without much trouble which allows you to go straight to the security check if you only have a carry-on bag. 570 was a relatively new 319 with good seats and pitch but 571 was an old 320 uncomfortable seating and lighting and very noisy in the front cabin until it had climbed up to cruise altitude.

"I travelled from Singapore to San Francisco only because it was a codeshare flight with ANA (from which I booked my tickets). Inflight entertainment was decent on the 1st leg of the flight to Tokyo presumably because it has just been upgraded with touch screen high resolution screens. However inflight service was horrid if you would even call it service to begin with. Flight attendant lashed out when I returned my tray (I was back from the restroom returning to my seat and thought it would be convenient for us both if I were to hand the tray to him since he was collecting the trays 2 rows before mine). ""Can you please wait"" with absolute annoyance and utter look of disdain before grudgingly snatching the tray away. The same flight attendant stepped on a pillow (which fell from a passenger's seat) while pulling the trolley and conveniently kicked it aside to the bottom of the passenger seat without a bat of his eyelid. On the food expect the same food you'll get from a low cost carrier. In fact you'll be better off with just cup noodles. It was the first time I have seen attendants hand out food without giving you the option to choose simply because ""we ran out of xx option so this is your only choice"". Inflight service was scarce no one bothered serving water after the meals and before flight landed. On the 2nd leg from Tokyo to SF there was a huge screen in front which they call inflight entertainment. You have the option to pay a nominal sum for wifi access and watch the movies from your own smart devices. Food was as poor as it can get for an international airline with poor service all the same. Rude attendants were still present but I was spared from any lashings this time round (the lady in front got reprimanded for the most ridiculous reason). I asked if I could make an inflight purchase 4 hrs before the flight was scheduled to land and was told the attendant in charge was resting. 2 hrs later I asked the same question and the same answer was given. Just when I decided I am not going to let United earn another cent from me that flight attendant finally finished her break right before the plane commenced its descent and asked what I would like to get. Do note that the ratings were made when comparing against the inflight experience I had when I took Cathay Pacific and ANA flights from Singapore to SF earlier this year and last year.",Detractor
Madrid to Malabo Equatorial Guinea. My flight was very pleasant as was the flight crew. Upon arrival at the airport in Malabo I had trouble contacting the client office that was to meet me at the airport. Iberia Public Relations supervisor offered to assist me. Like myself he was not successful. As it was near midnight he departed for the day and I remained at the airport continuing to attempt to contact my clients. The following day found me still at the airport. The Pubic Relations Supervisor returned and on finding I was still at the airport he took it upon himself to locate the office facility of the persons I had been unable to contact then took the time to transport me in his personal vehicle to that location.,Promoter
" Etihad Seat Allocation Policy is a major drawback. Seats can only be reserved by paying additional fees. At over $40 per sector (for non premium seats) this adds about 15% to the cost of the flight. Travel agent told me seat allocation is free at check-in. Online check-in opens 48 hours before, but again you can only select seats by paying, you only get free seat allocation if you checking within 24 hours of your flight. This is the only airline I have flown (apart from outright budget airlines) that have this policy. Be careful in comparing based on ticket price alone. Haven't even travelled yet and I have an unpleasant experience.",Detractor
My trip from Antalya to Amsterdam via Istanbul with Pegasus was very bad and disappointing. The expected transfer time of one hour in Istanbul was one hour. Arrival at Istanbul was one hour late because of a one hour delay at Antalya. The connecting flight was already closed at arrival. On arrival in Istanbul staff informed me I should not expect to travel to Amsterdam that evening and would be booked on a flight the next day. Hours of arranging papers at the airport to arrange for a stay in a hotel in Istanbul and waiting for nothing. Very unprofessional personnel at the airport.

"EY306 Kuwait to Abu Dhabi. Despite all the hype around Etihad being one of the top-tier Gulf carriers, I was surprised to find it to be woefully lacking on this short sector of 1h 55m. There was no drinks service at all in economy. This meant that two hapless flight attendants were asked randomly by passengers for drinks. It was hard for them to remember who asked for what and where they were sitting. Why not just bring the trolley down the aisle and do a drink service so that everyone has something and it isn't random chaos? Say what you want about the deplorable service on US and Canadian carriers, but at least they do a drink run, even on short flights on small commuter planes. Abu Dhabi is a terrible airport with almost all flights parked remotely and passengers shuttled around in buses.",Passive

"For the short flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, Thai Airways provided a better services in comparison with any airlines serving this route. I chose the airline because it serves Bangkok Suvarnabhumi International Airport. Then, the price was cheap and acceptable. The ground staff and the crews were extremely friendly and helpful. The inflight meal and the entertainment were also good. I was surprised that they fly the route using the big aircraft. In addition, the cabin appearance was nice and clean. Will definitely fly again with Thai Airways on the same route.",Promoter
"  Toronto to Stuttgart via Lisbon. I suggest that people think twice about booking with TAP. My credit card was charged for a change of flight reservation and they somehow ""lost my payment' and withdrew my ticket. I was instructed to provide my credit card statements proving that my credit card was debited, which I did. They still insisted that they weren't able to find my payment and I had to pay an additional $360CAD. After that, I still paid because I needed to get into Freiburg for school. When I got to the airport the desk personnel at TAP told me that the gate was changing that I needed to head in a completely different direction than what's on the ticket. I didn't think that someone at the airport would mislead me, but she did. I ended up missing my flight because i was in the wrong area and I wasn't allowed to cross over without exiting and going through security all over again. After calling TAP trying to get my some sort of resolution I was told that I would have to pay for a brand new flight because they have ""no idea"" what went on in Toronto and I've lost all the money associated to the flight that I missed. I'm not sure how to feel right now, I've never been so disrespected as a customer before in my life. I will never, ever book with TAP no matter how much money I'll be saving.

" Seoul Incheon to Amsterdam. I was satisfied with this flight overall. Check in process was friendly and efficient at Incheon airport, even though I arrived with less than an hour until departure. The seat was quite comfortable for a long trip, with plenty of leg room. I would say that the entertainment is not as good as on many other international airlines, but better than Asiana, with a reasonably interesting range of movies but a fairly lousy range of TV shows. I ordered a gluten free meal and was quite happy with the quality - probably one of the better GF meals I've had on a plane, but unfortunately Korean airlines don't seem to ever manage to provide GF bread. The range of drinks was okay, but again, I think it's smaller than many other international carriers, even in economy. The flight attendants serving my aisle were friendly and personable and made a real effort to interact with the passengers in a warm way - this was the most impressive part of the experience for me.

At the counter in Switzerland, they tell us that their computers are too old and they cannot select our seats for the long flight (Paris-Atlanta), and apparently the seats that we selected were gone. We get to Paris, they tell us the flight is full, we have to seat at random. Well at random, and even though we booked the flights together, meant that we had to sit in the middle row, on separate rows. To top it all of, my husband had an overweight passenger next to him that occupied part of his seat. If two people book a flight together can't you simply put them together? In general the flight attendants couldn't care less about trying to get us to seat together, I mean, not even tried or looked like they cared. Not even ""we apologize"" no, the attitude was more like ""I couldn't care less"". It was a terrible experience. I won't select Air France anytime soon.",Detractor

I flew from BRU-RIX-HEL-RIX-BRU between Dec 29 and Jan 5th. If flying with them I would recommend familiarizing yourself with their baggage policies especially if booking via eDreams because it is not pointed out very conspicuously. I ended up paying nearly 80 Euros for my baggage which I thought was included in the ticket price. My ticket cost about the same as my SK flights between BRU and HEL during the same period last year which included one checked bag. They are also anal retentive about the 20kg limit. My suitcase weighed 218 kg and the check in clerk made me remove stuff to get it under the 20kg limit. This really makes no sense for two reasons. 1) It went in my hand luggage which was transported on the same aircraft. The 1.9 kg that went in my hand luggage was unlikely to put the 737 over its MTOW. 2) It encourages oversized hand luggage. There was no enforcement of the 8kg and max physical size rule. On a small aircraft like a Dash-8 this can create huge problems in the event of an evacuation. My transit experience at their home base of RIX was absolutely fine. There were more than adequate food options which for the EU were reasonably priced. Very good free wifi as well. I had to stay at the airport overnight for my connection to BRU and found some very comfortable leather couches in one of the bar areas which was kept open overnight. On the return flight I was confused as to how they picked their aircraft choice. Jumping the puddle from HEL-RIX was done using a Boeing 737. However flying the 2hr 40mins from RIX-BRU was completed inside a Dash 8 puddle jumper. This is illogical. The seats were cramped for this length of flight and this was quite possibly the first time in my life that I did not at least enjoy the 'flying' portion of a flight. While the cabin crew was friendly and professional and the aircraft were for all intents and purposes spotless I don't think I would recommend the airline. When I added up the hassles over baggage and the extra fees I could have easily flown SK for the same price. Air Baltic needs to either be slightly more flexible in its baggage policies or lower their ticket prices significantly. For a LCC it is overpriced.,Detractor

"Pre flight was a bit of a concern as Air India retimed the flights at least six times based on the alerts I received despite the fact that the final time was exactly what I booked - they were late anyway! BOM-DEL on A321 was a pleasant surprise. Cabin welcoming but a bit battered, business class seat was OK for shorthaul. Breakfast was fantastic - cereal, croissants, fruit, hot main, choice of tea. Transfer at Delhi for the flight to Sydney was okay but could have been a lot better. Boeing 787 cabin colour scheme is a bit rich but a bit different and you could see the attempt at Indian influence. The seats convert to flatbed and best business class seat I have used. Service was fine - not refined but they provide pillows and blanket, pyjamas, great duvet, leather menu and landing card holder. Dinner service was great with choice of dessert, ice cream, chocolates, all delivered efficiently. Breakfast on the arrival to Australia was 'different' from a culinary point of view but very tasty.

"  Newark to Burlington. This is funny, because I can't actually review the flight. What I can review is the United customer service, which was terrible. After multiple delays, our 10pm flight was cancelled for maintenance. We were told to go to a customer service booth across the Newark airport at 1:00 am, but soon found that there was no one at the booth. The gate agent had just led us to a place where no one could help us. I got on the phone with a very kind customer service agent who couldn't help me - all the flights for the next two days were booked. We cancelled our trip entirely and were told that we would get a hotel voucher - but there was no one there. Instead, we ended up trying to find a hotel on our own because they said we could send a receipt in. All the hotels were booked in a 20 mile radius, so we took a lift back to my apartment in Philadelphia, which cost $150. I called the next morning and was assured I would get that money back. I submitted a form, and an agent online assured me that all I had to do was submit another form. I tried to submit that form, couldn't because I didn't have a valid ticket because I had gotten a refund, and called again a month ago - when I was again assured I would get reimbursed. It's been a month and I have heard nothing from them. If you like wasting money, having people tell you nice things with no follow through, and getting stranded in New Jersey, United is your airline. If you want to get to a destination, walking would probably be a more efficient use of your time.",Detractor

San Francisco to Boston in December 2014. I felt truly welcomed by the courteous ground staff who went out of their way to help me check in at the kiosks which were malfunctioning that day. I was looking forward to the flight but was greatly disappointed by the aloof demeanour of the attendants on the flight that day who seemed more interested in associating with each other than serving passengers and making us feel welcome. I realize that Virgin America is a low cost no frills carrier with a modern flair but the flight attendants on duty that day should take a lesson from the charming pilots heading the flight by at least cracking a smile and welcoming passengers on board rather than avoiding eye contact and appearing preoccupied with personal concerns. Moreover I was greatly disappointed by the lack of hot meals sold on board where small cold sandwiches and junk food consisting of crackers chips and cookies dominate the in flight menu. If you're hungry I would recommend bringing your own food on board.,Detractor
"  Flew EVA Air from London to Bangkok on Elite class. This is not my first time using EVA as they are my preferred choice when flying to BKK or Taipei. The online booking is pretty straight forward but I wish they allow passengers to edit their profile and input passport information prior to check in. I checked in online 24 hours before departure and dropped my luggage at Heathrow. There is never a queue for Elite class passengers which is a plus. Boarding was on time. The plane was 8 years old and has just been refurbished - new seats for Elite class as well as new entertainment system. Personally I think the entertainment system is decent - the screen is large with good resolution, but the programme is limited, and the flight map is not interactive. I prefer the old seat as it felt more comfortable. However the advantage of the new seat is that the chunky entertainment box has now been removed. They have upgraded the amenity pack but it was just the packing that is changed. Service on this flight was the biggest disappointment. The crew serving my area did not smile once - not a typical EVA standard. Food and wine were ok although I sensed some cost cutting this time.

I can honestly report that on both the journey out on 24th August and return on 3rd September we left pretty much on time and arrived at the scheduled time. The seat length, knee room, comfort were comparable to most other flights that we have taken albeit to Europe. If you are large you might struggle but that's a different argument. My husband is 6 foot and managed. The staff were organised and attentive but I did witness some expression of irritation from an overly demanding customer or two. High maintenance passengers would test the patience of saints! The food was good for in flight catering - let's face it this is not a restaurant but an aeroplane.

We flew economy Brisbane to Paris Via London and Hong Kong which although had 2 stops was faster than 1 stop and the departure and arrival time was suited - able to leave at night after work and arrive at night tired. We had great service and were ready to sing Cathay praises. This flight was great the meals movies etc. We chose Cathay as it had good prices and times for an open jaw flight bookable directly on their site (I prefer not to use Travel agents). Return was NYC to HK and HK to BNE. The meals were terrible. For a 14 hour trip and we were served 2 terrible meals (the first in many flights that I have ever really thought - yuk) and just couldn't eat including vegetables and pasta SO overcooked. (miss being able to pre-order seafood meals and no healthy options unless you want a fruit plate served at every meal for 60+ hours - really?). We were lucky that we got on with food and coffee from the airport lounge (as they take some time to serve - unlike Singapore) and the passenger next to us told us how grumpy he was due to hunger - after his 2 meals! When we buzzed cabin service on the return trip it was served with a grimace and we were made feel uncomfortable. It is very different from the excellent professional and immediate service that Singapore Airlines provides in economy.,Passive
LHR-ADD-(JRO)-MBA. Although the handling agent at Heathrow (Dnata) is clearly disinterested in giving any kind of customer service (opened check-in late very unprofessional in the way they spoke to passengers not dressed appropriately in uniform did not open Cloud Nine desk on time) this is not reflected in the attitude of the ET staff which was excellent throughout. We were made to feel very welcome onboard and the service was above a number of European airlines I have traveled recently on long-haul flights. There was a choice of meal in economy with wine or spirits. The service was generous and always available. If you wanted more you were made to feel welcome in the galley where you would be offered another drink etc. Special interest was the way the crew dealt with a passenger with disabilities. The adult passenger (who was being cared for by a family member) became quite agitated and at other times excited while on the flight. The crew were gentle and kind even giving the passengers some 'space' in the galley out of sight of others to re-group and calm down. IFE is on demand and there is plenty to choose from. Addis is not the best airport on earth with little to do however it beats other African hubs hands-down. No good restaurants to speak of and no lounge access to any card holders. An extra (unscheduled) stop was put upon us out of ADD. The onward flight also had good snacks and drinks although it was short and again a helpful and well presented crew.

"  Stuttgart to Barcelona. Arriving at STR airport, everything seems fine. According to the airport flight monitor, there was no delay, sched. dep. 14:55. I also checked on the Vueling website and was shocked: new expected departure time 19:00 because of ""operational reasons"". But was the flight delayed or not? The airport still said the flight would be on time. So I checked in normally, went to the gate, the gate staff came on time and turned on their computer. Only problem: there was no aircraft at the gate. They knew nothing about the delay. When passengers complained and showed them the Vueling website with the delay, the staff announced: ""We don't know where the plane is, but according to passengers the plane didn't even take off from Barcelona."" We got food vouchers, but still no information whether the flight would even operate. 4 hours later, they announced a new departure time of 19:30. In the end, the plane departed at 19:55 - five hours later than expected. The flight itself was okay, the plane was very new, service was normal, the seat pitch was quite low. But they didn't want to comment on the delay, very unprofessional. The return flight had also a delay, but at least ""just"" 40 minutes. Customer service via E-Mail is an absolute horror, it takes weeks for an answer. Telephone hotline is constantly occupied. In short: the airline has the potential to be a good LCC, but their operations are just poor (nicely said). The customer gets zero information from Vueling, even the airport gets zero information. No customer service available. A lot of delays. The Airbus planes are in good condition, inflight staff is decent, seat pitch could be better. I'll try the airline again in the coming years, hoping they improved their operational difficulties.",Passive
" Overall short distance flights by Swiss are pretty solid. The Service is good, the usual Sandwich on the afternoon is solid for a Inflight meal. Lately Swiss flights have been quite often late - the one on the way from MCR to ZRH (which I flew many times already) is actually almost always late. But thats probably because of Manchester Airport. Seats in the new C Series are comfortable and the space is average. But the screens in the C-Series are actually smaller than my Handy display.",Promoter
"  This is the second time I have flown Finnair business class on the new Airbus A350, Bangkok - Helsinki - Bangkok. Both flights departed and arrived on time. Their mobile application has to be one of the best in the industry. Was able to check-in online for all my flights including connecting ones. Digital boarding passes accepted at all airports. The individual business class seats are excellent, lots of storage space, both USB and electrical plug outlets, reading light, full flat bed, large television screen with very good inflight/interactive entertainment system with superb noise cancelling headphones, nice amenity kit, comfortable pillow and duvet, very good food and beverage with unlimited snacks, candy, nuts, ice cream, etc. The service by the cabin staff was excellent, really 5 star ! Duty free shopping I pre-ordered through their website was waiting on my seat as I boarded. Only negative was I was not able to connect to the free WiFi on either flight. Give the short northern route flight time to Europe and the very reasonable airfare, Finnair offers an exceptional business class value - highly recommend.",Promoter
" Customer service is terrible! No one is accommodating. I was booked to go from Baltimore to Philadelphia then Philadelphia to Charlotte then Charlotte to Ft Walton Beach at Gate C2 at BWI. Literally across from me at C3 was a flight to Charlotte leaving slightly before me. I arrived and had plenty of time to possibly fly standby but was told I could not. 1 rep on the phone said I had to have a â€œsame route changeâ€ despite the fact it was literally going to my one hub destination-Charlotte and there was a winter travel advisory for yesterday in Philadelphia. The personnel at gate told me I couldn't because I would have had to change it downstairs. I'm getting mixed messages. AA could have had an extra seat in Philadelphia if it needed it, especially with the travel advisory yesterday I can imagine there were a lot of delays and cancellations. I asked where the change of ticket policy was easily accessible to he customer and was told â€œyou have to search for it in the search boxâ€. It's not clearly expressed when you buy your ticket. This is my first and last time flying American Airlines. I would rather pay more for a ticket than deal with their poor routes and terrible service.",Detractor

ICN-LHR. What a contrast to my outward flight! Champagne on boarding frequent water runs during lunch. Drinks and food runs during the darkened flight. QS meant comfortable sleep but on a different configuration of a/c with better IFE. Good food (ssambap for my lunch and a very nice hot croissant sandwich midway through flight) . Early arrival in LHR despite circling and then overflying to come in from west and luggage was on carousel as I arrived. Excellent flight.,Promoter
 Excellent flight with jetblue Mint business class. Our bags were taken to get checked in by a lovely jetblue mint team member. We got expedited security clearance too. We boarded on time and got seated. Our flight attendants came round and introduced themselves and asked if this was our first time flying mint. Our amenity kits and a little note were left on the seat. They came round with noise cancelling headphones for everyone. They asked if we would like a drink and myself and my husband chose the refresh mint cocktail. They came round and cleared cups before we took off. Bottles of water provided at every seat in advance. Seat was super comfortable I loved the fact the offer directTV entertainment this was great. The inflight wifi worked perfect and I could stream facebook live. The food again was lovely we ordered the plane eats menu and everything was tasty. The only slight gripe was that the croutons on the salad were soggy. But that's all I could say. Excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. Ice cream for pudding and I chose a lovely freshly brewed coffee. A decent choice of wines with our meal. I settled down as we flew at night and got around 3 hours sleep. It was lovely. The duvet pillow and seat were all comfortable. Cabin and toilets all clean. They left us a milkbar cookie to take home. I would definitely fly jetblue mint again.,Promoter
"I was forced to fly from Orlando to Dallas/Fort Worth just get back to Pensacola. It doesn't make any sense to fly over my city just to get back to my city and add four hours. I accepted it and moved on. The reason why I am writing this review is because I arrived at Ft Worth about 15 minutes later than the flight expected. things happen, and I understand that. But when I arrived I almost immediately heard my name over the intercom for a final boarding call to Pensacola. I was told I had 10 minutes to reach the gate or I wouldn't make it. I made it to the gate I was instructed to reach in less than 3 mins. It was the wrong gate. They told me the incorrect gate both on the plane and over the intercom. SO when I finally found airport staff they told me the correct gate. Luckily it was just a few down. I got to it with more than five minutes to spare in my 10 minute time I was given. I walked up to three personnel from American Airlines and they didn't even want to break out of their personal conversation to help me. When I said ""I heard my name, I'm here to get on"" they told me they had just closed the gate and that I would need to be re-booked. The girl who locked me out of the flight didn't even want to help me get re-booked. She pawned it off to another employee as if it was a chore. He didn't even look me in the face the entire time and told me that I would need to fly at 8.30 that night if I wanted to fly today. I asked how to file a complaint. All he said was ""go online"". I will not be flying with American Airlines again.",Detractor
"I booked Singapore to Larnaca return trip through them, assuming they would be at par with the other Arab airlines. My nightmare started when the airline decided to simply cancel my flight and rebook me to a return flight 4 days later. They assume people have no job. Then they changed my single stop flight to a triple stop 32 hour nightmare. No apologies, no refund, no explanation. During this ordeal, I was told by one of the so called Etihad Airways staff in Abu Dhabi that we would be upgraded to business class in order to access the lounge in at least 1 of the legs of this hellish flight. Not only did that not happen, and I had to spend a total of 11 hours in transit walking around airport like a gypsy, we had no food on the last leg of the flight. To top it all, after 32 hours they lost both out luggage, despite confirmations at each leg of the way that the luggage was on board. Yes, the planes were pretty, but that can be taken for granted on all these airlines. This was by far the worst airline I ever flown on. The cheap fare is not worth it.",Detractor

"Missed our family's wedding thanks to Spirit Airlines. I booked a flight for the 4 of us to attend a family wedding in Oregon. We checked the status of our flight before driving 4 hours to the airport and everything was on time. Upon arriving in Chicago and checking in and getting to the gate it started raining and our flight was delayed 1 hour. No big deal we thought. Then a little later delayed another hour. Then 3 hours. We patiently waited, I asked the person at the desk and he told me the plane was circling above and waiting to land and then we will board the plane. No problem, I thought. It was now about midnight. A while later they announce that our flight has now been cancelled. The rain was well past us by now to the East. Also found out the same flight was cancelled the night before because of weather also. So after waiting at the ticket counter for 1 hour, we get the choice of a full refund or take the next flight 2 days later. Well, after realizing we are not guaranteed to make the wedding on time, we took the refund and missed our loved ones wedding. We will never fly Spirit again. Very disappointed. We spent 13 hours traveling and sitting around waiting for nothing.",Detractor
My husband and I recently flew to Sydney New Zealand and Dubai from the UK (round trip) and booked with Emirates some of our flights were on a Qantas aircraft and how they have changed over the last 25 years! I last flew with them back in the late 80's and back then couldn't rate them more highly. What a great airline they were even though I flew economy I was treated as if I was in first class. Now I would compare them to Ryanair or some such other cheap airline. They really pack you in like sardines even on long haul (7 hour plus flights) most of these flights left us in physical pain from being so squashed in. The aircraft's are looking old and tired. We nearly didn't get on one flight (Sydney to Queenstown) as they had over booked it. The ground crew did try their best to be helpful and we did finally manage to make it onto the flight but had to be rushed through even though we'd arrived a good 2.5 hours before our flight. They weren't able to seat us together which is so disappointing when you have booked seats in advance. I hate this level of poor service. I would never choose to fly with them again sadly.,Detractor
 Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference. Overall an outstanding pair of flights yet again and I really enjoy flying long haul with Emirates.,Promoter

"  This was my first flight with Wizz Air and I have only positive comments to make especially for the crew of the return flights from Krakow to London on the 2nd of January 2019. The flight to Krakow left on time and the boarding process was very straightforward and pleasant. On my return flight from Krakow to London the flight left with a 15 minute delay, however this was due, to the need to de-ice the plane before departure, which was announced by the captain promptly as soon as every passenger was on the plane. Despite the delay we managed to get to London on time without any problems. Like all budget airlines, Wizz Air was limited in offering snacks and drinks, however this is very normal considering the cost of the flight, infact train tickets sometime cost twice as much. But one of the best aspect of the flight were the 4 gems making part of the cabin crew who were very helpful and kind throughout the flight.",Promoter

Important to mention that to me, Club Premier is probably the worst frequent flyer program. It lacks of clarity, difficult to know how many miles you need for your next tier, upgrades are a joke, selective and random without clear rules. Instead of making a happy customer, you feel embarrassed for ""begging"" for upgrades. The mobile APP is worthless. Aeromexico is abusive knowing their dominance in the Mexican market.",Passive

"  Arrived at curbside check in at 5:30 am for a 6:43 departure (Tampa to Greensboro, via Charlotte. Then later that afternoon I was scheduled to leave Greensboro on a direct flight to Philadelphia and returning to Tampa the following day). Stand at curbside for ten minutes or so waiting for â€œcomputer problemsâ€ to be resolved so I can check my one bag. Finally gave up and went inside. Stood in that line for I guess another fifteen minutes or so because by the time it was my turn I was one minute ... yes, one minute inside the 45 minute cutoff to check a bag. What ensued over the next ten or fifteen minutes is not even worth going into, but suffice it to say that due to the ineptitude and uncaring of this â€œcustomer service representativeâ€ and his even more inept and uncaring supervisor, I missed a domestic flight I arrived an hour and fifteen minutes early for and was put on standby for the next one which was going to get me in an hour later than my first meeting was scheduled to start. While waiting on standby at the gate, I happened to start chatting with a girl sitting next to me, and turns out she is an AA employee's daughter, and tells me somewhat sheepishly that it is AA policy to overbook every flight by at least five seats and their workaround is that any preferred status members who want on a flight can get on because they will work the system to get idiots like me who had the audacity to want to check a piece of luggage to â€œmissâ€ their flight by milking the clock and then invoking FAA regulations. By some miracle, I did get on the standby flight, made it to Charlotte and on to Greensboro and went to baggage claim to get my bag. Guess what? No bag. A patently disinterested, gum-popping employee in the baggage office told me that my bag had been checked on to Philadelphia because â€œthis isn't where you are actually going.â€ Oh no? Then why am I here now? Too much in a hurry to worry about it, I left to get to what was left of my meetings and returned to the airport in Greensboro. With time in hand before my flight I decided to check and see if a different employee might have some other info about the bag containing my meeting clothes and other necessities for my meeting the following morning that I now hadn't seen for almost twelve hours. This woman, who was actually nice enough, unlike everyone else I had dealt with so far, proceeded to tell me in about 0.2 seconds that yes, in fact, my bag was already in Philadelphia. The amazing part was that she hadn't looked at my baggage claim ticket or touched her computer so I guess she was a psychic? Apparently a bad one, however, because when pressed she admitted she had no basis for that claim and decided maybe sne should call someone (never did say who or where) and double check, at which point she says that in fact my bag has very considerately been held here for me in Greensboro and will be joining me on the plane to Philadelphia. Super. Only guess what? I land in Philadelphia and there is no bag waiting for me there, so once again I head for the baggage office of AA. Luck happened to be with me this time and I happened to get helped by a wonderful person named Zakiyah who patiently worked to disentangle all of the lies, ineptitude and misinformation that had been dogging my poor little suitcase all day long and finally deduced that it had been taken off the plane and put on the wrong conveyor in another terminal and was revolving forlornly on a conveyor belt a few buildings over",Detractor
"  Denver to Seattle. I only chose 1/10 because I couldn't choose 0/10!! I booked a flight to Seattle for $165 round trip. When I went to check in online, I was charged an addition $116 for a checked bag, one carry on, and my seat (because apparently your seat isn't included in the purchase price), via ""the perks"" option. This charge stated it was my additional cost for my round trip flight. There was no in flight entertainment, they charged you for refreshments (that they only accepted debit or credit as payment for), and they passed out credit card applications to everyone on board. The seats are miserable and the plane lacked cleanliness. Next came my return flight. I flew out at 6:40 at night. I wrapped up work, and headed to the airport 4 hours early, to check my bag, so I wouldn't have to drag it around. Unlike United, they only show up two hours prior to departure to check bags for the flight, though none of this information is told to you when you purchase your ticket. They also refuse your bag 45 minutes before departure, leaving one hour to check everyone's bags, so the line was huge, and the ticket agent showed up 20 minutes late!! When I finally got to the counter to check my bag, I was charged another $60, and was told ""the perks option only covers a checked bag and carry on on my initial flight, and only my checked bag on my returning flight.

" United must be trying to coerce Basic Economy buyers to upgrade by treating you like complete garbage. One of their rude staff members even told us our experience was the way it was (very very terrible) because we bought Basic Economy tickets. The staff from the DIA ticket counter to the gate were all unprofessional and rude. Our worst flight experience ever, and we've had many flights, was on this flight. This was the first time we bought a Basic Economy ticket, although unknowingly through a popular online reseller. So to start, we found out you only get one personal item and no small carry-on. Usually we have our small carry-on and personal item, which fit just fine under the seat with room to spare for our feet. Second, there is no online check-in, you will waste your time trying like I did. Third, when you go to the airport, numerous United signs tell you to use a kiosk to check in. That doesn't work either, as the kiosk instructs you to go to a ticketing agent to waste time. You have to look for a tiny little section off to the left that reads ""Economy"", where it is manned by a single representative. Fourth, once we got to the rude Economy ticketing agent, he pretended to not know why the kiosk rejected us so we had to show him. He quickly reminded us that we have the junk ""Basic Economy"" tickets. Then, we tried to hand our checked/labeled baggage to said rude agent since he had a scale one feet to his left, and he points to the other longer line and says ""it goes over there"". On to the bag line, the lady there was no better. She tells my wife in a rude tone (while also talking angrily to her coworkers), ""License and boarding pass!"" No ""hello"", no ""how are you"", not even a complete sentence, and they weren't even very busy so it surely couldn't have been that she was rushing or stressed out. After a very long security line wait with ultra slow TSA workers, we finally got to the gate and the door had just shut. This part was only partially United's fault due to lack of online check-in and their deceiving kiosk signs which wasted a good 30 minutes of precious time. The United gate agent was completely unprofessional and bitter and lacked any sympathy whatsoever. She kept telling me, in very stern fashion, to check my ticket next time as if I were new to flying. With a reluctant look on her face and body language, she got us onto a later flight. We lost our purchased seats, and my 8 year old was assigned a seat away from our group next to complete strangers. To conclude, making United staff do any extra work is a crime so steer clear of United Airlines.",Detractor
" Orlando to Detroit. We were notified 4:00 a.m via text and email that our return flight home from Orlando had been cancelled. We received no explanation of why it was cancelled. We called the Frontier to get more information and was told that flight had been cancelled and we would have to book another flight, we attempted to do so to realize there were no other flights until tomorrow. This being unacceptable and not an option for us to stay another night we explained we could not do this, and was told if we had to book with another flight we would have to make sure we completed documentation for refund and what carrier we had to go through. We were truly upset that the only flight we could find that could accommodate was going to cost us more than the original full trip airfare we paid. We received an email about a voucher we could use for up to 90 days that simply said sorry for inconvenience. Why would we want to fly Frontier ever again, when you couldn't provide us with professional customer service to get us home? Then told we will not get reimbursed for 4 to 6 weeks. Horrible customer service even after asking to speak with a manager, they seemed so unaffected by the lives of our family members and we had kids.

" New York to Dubai via Kuwait. Before booking, I had read many reports about the improved Kuwait Airways and unbeatable price. I was unsure what to expect. The check-in was a breeze at JFK and the agent said it was a light flight with about 35-40% load factor. That was surprising being just a day before Eid. Boarding was easy, and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule. JFK-KWI flight, the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable. Legroom was fantastic. I managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself. Rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves. Individual TV screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming. The crew was friendly and courteous. Menus, blanket, and basic amenity pouch handed out. Food was ok but can improve in quality. Was concerned about the short 45 min connection in Kuwait, but the flight arrived about an hour early. Kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and duty-free shops. Security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays. My KWI-DXB flight (B 777-300 ER) was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security. The short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway Iftar meal boxes. So, an in all a rather good flight. Return leg: DXB-KWI (A320) was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out. KWI-JFK via Shannon was painful with an 85% load. Long security lines at the gate in Kuwait. One of the Kuwaiti pax who I chatted with was like - this flight is always delayed. Multiple security checks and verifications. Lotta connecting passengers mostly from South Asia and some of them didn't know the flight had a stopover at Shannon. Lunch served, and amenity kits handed out. My choice of meal had run out but was nothing great. All pax deplaned at Shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs. It just gave time to stretch and use the toilets. Cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but I asked for blankets and was told none remain, however at the time of deplaning at JFK found an open overhead bin full of blankets. Verdict: Decent airline but Kuwait airport needs an urgent upgrade. Shannon stop over is painful. Yes, fantastic price, beating some of the major middle east airlines by 35% on this route.

"  Johannesburg to Hong Kong via Dubai. Our flight took off and about about 2 or 3 hours into the flight the captain of our flight announced that our flight had been turned back to Johannesburg due to a problem at Dubai airport. No further announcements were made. On arrival back in Johannesburg we disembarked the plane and waited approximately 2 hours to receive our luggage, after which we were ushered to a bus taking us to a hotel where we would spend the night. Bearing in mind that our hotel arrangements were in place when landed back in Johannesburg, this could have been communicated to passengers over the PA system or by Emirates ground crew. We were not given any update as to what would happen to our connections. We were shuttled back to the airport at 2am, boarding commenced at 3am and we took off again at 5 am. At no point were we given any indication of what would happen to our connections. When we arrived in Dubai (around 3:30pm) we were greeted with the chaos that was Dubai Airport, and then spent 11 hours waiting to be assigned new connecting flights. I was eventually given a connecting flight to Hong Kong 2 days later and put on standby for a flight leaving 3am on 5 August. Rudeness from Emirate ground staff, all we were given were muffins juice and water for sustenance. Not a single Emirates employee made an announcement to make sense of the chaos nor where there any notices or communications. Passengers on flights that arrived an hour or 2 after hours sailed through to their connecting flights as is customary because they had been issued with connecting boarding passes at their departing airports. They also lost my luggage for the duration of my trip!",Detractor
"  London to Riyadh via Istanbul. I booked a seat by the window on the right-hand side. The flight left at 01:20 so I expected to be able to sleep. On going through the gate security the staff scribbled out the seat number and wrote the same row (31, I believe, the second to last row) but wrote seat E. I asked why and they said the plane had been changed but it was the same size as the first leg and I was supposed to be in the exact same seat - 31F. I tried to engage them further but they just waved me off. The flight attendants on board said the flight was overbooked which was a lie. The person next to me, who had taken my seat, was a woman with a crying baby. I said nothing to her as that would be rude, and I'm not as rude as Turkish Airlines' staff. This is by no means the first time it has happened, but only seems to be leaving or entering Saudi Arabia. Sometimes I appreciate a woman doesn't want to be seated next to a male stranger, but this woman was still next to me, and had the side of the plane to lean on - exactly why I chose to book the seat in advance, instead of just turning up knowing the staff will steal someone else's. One good point was she had a huge, blow up cushion between her and the aircraft window which I will look for and use when I fly in future, with a different airline of course.",Detractor
My wife and I travelled from Manila-Doha-Oslo (Business Class) on 24th/25th Sep 2013. I have nothing but praise for the attendants and aircraft on the outbound journey. First leg was a 777ER this is still a great plane. Second leg was on a 787 Dreamliner this plane makes even the 777 seem obsolete. Inbound journey from Oslo to Doha was again a Dreamliner and was as close to perfect as you could ask for. When we boarded the flight from Doha to Manila on 10th Sep 2013 it was not good from the start. We have flown many times on Qatar Business Class and this was the first time the attendant just pointed up the aisle and said the 2 seats up front on the right. When it came to food I chose the seafood entree and the lobster part was still half frozen there was no tablecloth or serviettes. At least for the main course we were then given tablecloth and serviettes. However we both chose the tenderloin beef this turned out to be dry and overcooked. I was asked which wine would I like I chose a Chardonnay which was excellent but when I asked for another I was given about a tablespoon full and was told they had run out. This flight is always overbooked so it makes sense for the airline to fill the seats. In doing this though the moment these people see free unlimited food and drink they consume it like there is no tomorrow. The plane was an Airbus which is not of the quality of their Boeings due to its age and the seat leg lift did not raise so I ended up with swollen feet as I do in economy. Luckily we spent all our Qmiles on duty free in Doha so now I will try another airline next time. It is a shame as we have never had anything but praise for Qatar.,Passive
Travelled from Toronto to Montego Bay return. We were pleased that our flight departed on-time in both directions but that was the only good part of this airline experience. The plane was very old cramped and filthy. The seats couldn't have been more narrow and there was no leg room at all. If the person in front reclined their seat it was about 10 inches from your face. Don't get fooled by the $40 upgrade option. We paid this to get more leg room to sit in an exit row but our seats didn't recline. This airline boasts that they provide champagne service and food at no extra charge. However the champagne was served in a pill-cup and the microwaved food was barely edible. I hope we never have to travel on this airline again.,Detractor

My flight to Colorado Springs with connection at Denver was delayed which in turn made me miss my connection flight. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to fly the next day at 8 am.

"  Los Angeles to Miami. I am writing this message at the end of my 3rd straight failed flight attempt with American. Hopefully American learn something from my poor experience and use that to create a better experience for the next guy. On Tuesday 4 October I knew the flight I was originally on for Thursday 6 October was going to get screwed up due to the impending hurricane so I tried to be proactive and call American. I was charged ~$720 to change the flight to Wednesday 5 October. My friend who was also on that same flight, waited until hours later to change his flight. Since a weather alert was issued, he was charged $0 to change his flight. Now you would think that American would be happy that I was proactive and allowed them to be organized, but when I called in and asked for a refund since I thought it was ridiculous that I was charged ~$720 for being proactive, my request naturally was rejected. On Monday 10 October I was booked on flight AA68 leaving at 10:30am. The flight was delayed because there was an oil leak. The original flight was postponed to Tuesday 11 October, however we offered a free transfer to a different flight taking off at 3 pm (4.5 hours later). As a reparation, we were offered food that had already been expired (see picture 1). Finally after boarding the flight, I was given a seat with a defective television screen so I had to stare at a screen with inverted colors while the rest of my flight was able to enjoy a movie. Fortunately, this gave me plenty of time to think about what an awful job American has done on my last 3 flights. American Airlines has just come off of a record year making $7.6 billion dollars. The last two times I've worked with American I gave them roughly $2,000 worth of business. Everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. Every single flight was delayed, I was fed expired food, I was charged over $700 to change a flight before a natural disaster that you allowed other clients to change for free. The behavior of American has been completely unacceptable.",Detractor

" Guangzhou to Beijing. This is my first flight with China Southern Airlines since it moved to Terminal 2 in Guangzhou. I checked in on their APP so I don't need to rush to the airport. I got one piece of luggage checked in and walked around the new terminal. It was huge, convenient and beautiful. As they adopted self-boarding at Terminal 2, I got the chance to experience this. I just needed to put my boarding pass with the bar code on the machine to be scanned and it took about 2 seconds to let me through. The seat was more spacious compared with their Boeing 777-300, and that was why I chose this flight with A330. I fell into sleep after take-off soon and the whole flight was steady.

" Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. I flew Singapore Airlines with my spouse from Dhaka to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. We had booked the tickets around 3 months ahead which allowed us to get them at unimaginably cheap price. So given the overall quality of service we received was great bang for buck. We loved the interior which had nice Christmas decorations. The legroom was sufficient for an economy seat. The food on the menu was better than what I have had on most flights. The cabin crew were extremely polite and helpful. Our takeoff was slightly delayed due to issues with airport and I was afraid we will miss the connecting flight from Singapore. However, we were allowed to board the flight at Singapore even though we were 5 minutes late and the last passengers in! So they were basically waiting for us. I was very satisfied with the experience and I would love to fly again.",Promoter
" Cancun to Dallas Ft Worth. Due to bad weather in the US, our return flight from Mexico to DFW was cancelled - this is not what I'm upset about. My concern is how we were treated. There was NO airline rep at the gate, and we were told over the PA to go to another gate for ""more info"", which they never communicated what was going on or how we would book another flight. We had to go back through customs and they transported all passengers to different resorts for the night (I do appreciate the accommodation), but still, no information on how to secure new flights. Not everyone had international phone service if they even had a personal phone, and, the resort didn't have a way to get online and book a new flight. The app said ""no flights available"", and if you tried calling AA, you would get hung up on. After 1.5 hours on hold, we were able to secure a flight. AA should have re-booked everyone before we were transported away from the airport. I was traveling with a group of 10, including 2 in a wheelchair. Once we made it to DFW, our flight to Kansas City was ""oversold"", even though we had tickets and the agent at the gate was very rude and not empathetic, nor did she communicate what was going on. I was told ""you should thank this man for giving up his seat for you"" - really? This is not how you treat customers. I submitted a compliant, and they said they were ""sorry for the weather, outside of their control"", and I responded that is not what I was complaining about, and they sent another response back saying ""it's not their policy to compensate""...again, that is not what I was looking for. I just wanted to provide feedback so they have an opportunity to not lose any more customers. I will never fly with American Airlines again. I should have stuck with my old faithful and reliable Southwest Airlines",Detractor
MUC-SIN 777-300ER 5/5/15. Older plane was a bit rough around the edges but it might be one of the ones due for a refit. Flight left on time and arrived on time.

AVOD is limited. Food is always outstanding out of Narita. The menu you'll get for the Japanese meals is kaiseiki and would cost at least 6-7000 yen if eaten out on the town. However when returning to Japan from abroad the Japanese meals are less than stellar and are inadequate to the level of quality from NRT. They have been offering discounted business class fares that make this a very good value for money. Flew domestic US first class and it just cannot be compared to what you get on ANA business. The lounge in LAX is refurbished and as good as the lounge at NRT. Truly a joy to fly them. The long haul experience with them helps make the travel as painless as possible.,Promoter
" Bangkok to Rome via Kuwait City. First time travelling with Kuwait Airways and barely have any complaints. Luggage drop/check in fast and smooth, normal (not incredibly organized) boarding. When it comes to the flights, much more leg space than what you usually get on other aircraft and everything was new. Big screen , not the widest western movie selection but you may find 4/5 movies that you'd like to watch. Food more than decent (good salmon quiche also), plentiful and fruit and veggie tasted fresh. Kind -and really pretty hostesses,I'm a girl and can add that on top! Only given a blanket, face mask and headcuffs. No problem with the luggages. The airport in Kuwait deserves mention: free wifi and free lounge with the comfiest recliner chairs and snacks for economy travelers.

" Zurich to Barcelona. Our flight with Vueling was canceled due to strikes of air traffic control in France around the 27-30th of April 2018. We had to cancel our trip. The issue is that most passengers were stranded and had to cancel their trips, and those passengers, as we were, were forced to call customer care at Vueling Airlines, and be put on hold for up to 30 minutes, repeatedly. The customer care number, if you're not calling from within Spain, cost 78c a minute. This is outrageous, because the airline is not able to process such crisis, when flight are canceled.

Buisness class seat was amazing you can adjust and incline the seat how you like it and there's a massage button.

Business class had no different leg room, seat size or any other comfort than economy. On some airlines when travelling short haul the middle seat is left empty, not with SAS. The only discernible difference was that business class passengers had free drinks and a meal. No choice in the meal. Whatever it started out as by the time it got to me it was utterly inedible. OK we got a greater baggage allowance but it would have been cheaper to buy an extra bag than pay for a non existent business class seat! Never again.

IAD-BKK (via AUH) round-trip. IAD-AUH (A340-600) - flight only 20% full and I had the bulkhead seat with an open seat next to me. Had a great experience with in-flight food entertainment and service. I chalk that up to the empty flight and minimal stress on FA's. Bulkhead seats are normally 75$ per leg but was able to get it during online check-in. Bulkhead had plenty of legroom and you don't have to worry about reclining seats. IFE is slightly smaller and with lower graphics quality. Cons: seats are quite hard halfway through the 12 hr flight my tailbone was so sore I had to sit on a pillow for the rest of trip. Transit AUH - first time at airport and transit in evening was a breeze with minimal lines for transfer/secondary security. I had a short layover so didn't check on the facilities. Food options are limited and expensive. AUH-BKK (777) - completely full flight and boarding process was very chaotic. Basically a complete free for all boarding. They boarded by rows but gate agents were not enforcing it. I will avoid flying on 777 especially with the 3-4-3 set up and the poor seat pitch. Cabin was very hot even though I was just in a T-shirt. FA's did their best scrambling around with the full flight. Seats again were very hard and not comfortable. BKK-AUH (777) - same experience as the inbound flight. Cabin too warm and breakfast food was pretty bad on this flight. By far the worse on the trip. Boarding in BKK still very chaotic. AUH transit with US Customs pre-clearance - 3 hour layover in the early morning and airport was very busy. Secondary security had long lines and had to wait 30 min. Food options is still terrible. US pre clearance at AUH was a mixed bag. No dedicated lines for US citizens. AUH-BKK (A340) - another full flight and a complete reversal in my Etihad experience. FA had difficult time communicating with mostly South Asian customers. Meal service was a zoo - I have never seen so many different special meal requests. There's a 30-40 min lag between special meal service and regular meal service. Special meal customers ended up holding on their meals for 1 hr. Some flyers had to take their own tray back to the FA. Cabin temperature fluctuated a couple times from cold to warm. IAD luggage took forever. Waited for a full 30 min at the carousel from the first bag to my bag. Probably would not fly Etihad economy even with the lowest price. Seat pitch way too small for intl long hauls. AUH transit was not very pleasant with lines everywhere and terrible food options.,Passive

Food a bit disappointing - the breakfast tasted poor and was sickly. Good choice of entertainment. Could not sleep in the seat though just not comfortable enough to relax sufficiently. On return journey cabin was partly empty which looked promising but the only benefit was faster service and no toilet queue. A man sat in front of me and reclined his seat fully for the whole 13 hours except meals which wrecked my journey.

"Delayed at HKG in transit the day before, when Dragonair ground crew excelled in helping us get sorted out. Cathay Pacific met high expectations but excelled in our treatment by Chief Purser and Inflight Services Manager. They provided us information on our connection and bumped 5 of us up to business class for last 45 mins of the flight so we could be off the plane quickly. On arriving in HCM, we were met by Vietnam Airlines ground staff who helped us through Immigration, collect our check-in luggage, carry a case between terminals and then help us check-in, right up until we went through security, where he waved us off and wished us a pleasant trip. Wow - service at it's best all round.",Promoter
Absolutely awful. Do not fall for the fancy advertisments as they mislead you. Delays were up to 2 hours and rude ground and cabin crew. Food was simply standard. Breakfast was bland and soggy. The IFE was very good. The crew service was rushed and the atmosphere was awful. Never again!,Detractor

I boarded at 8am for this 2 hour flight, and when meal was served I was surprised to see a combo meal of curry, potato bhajee, cutlet, bread with jam and butter.

AKL-HKG and return. A340 both ways. Have not flown this route or airline for many years but had very good memories of past flights sadly this appeared to be a different airline altogether. Boarding was rather disorganised seemed to be totally at random. Crew seemed very eager to serve lunch after 1.30pm takeoff rapidly cleared trays ordered window shutters closed then disappeared for rest of flight. Only way to get a drink was to go to end of the aircraft and ask for one. No mid flight water or service was offered. Inflight movie selection was very dated and certainly not current. Old style corded remote. Could put up with all of the above but could not tolerate the seats the worst seat I have ever used in my entire life tolerable for 1-2 hours then agony fortunately seat back did not recline into your face but strange cushion arrangement which allows the seat cushion to move forward leaving no lower back support and a terrible slouching position. Totally useless had to ram pillows and blankets behind my back for some meagre support. If I had known how bad this would be I would certainly not have flown this airline. Fortunately I had an aisle seat and could easily get up and walk a little. Meals were usual economy fare just barely edible but nothing to rave about. Return flight from HKG started with a circus HK locals with seats all over the economy section boarded early and just grabbed seats in pairs regardless of seat numbers on their tickets. I had booked an aisle seat in row 32 6 months ago and boarded almost last on the plane my seat was long taken by someone whose seat was way back this rippled all the way through the front of economy and ended with 6 pax stranded at the front of economy with their seats taken cabin crew refused to move anyone and told us to just get seats that were left. Ended up in a window seat which I had tried so hard to avoid. Cabin crew couldn't seem to care less. Not a great experience all round and then 11 hours with that seat again never again.,Detractor
DXB-ARN-DXB. Biz class return In short both these flights were of a high calibre especially the return leg on the 08/05 ARN-DXB the Purser was an English lady who is a total asset to the airline.

The aircraft was clearly very old cramped seats with extremely limited leg room. Drop down tvs overhead not seat back screens. Extremely old films overhead screens were just inches from my head and there was a warning on the back of the seat about this.

A recent trip to Europe with Qantas/Emirates involved three legs with Emirates and one (Dubai to Sydney) with Qantas. Two of the Emirates legs were OK but the leg from Barcelona to Dubai was not up to any realistic standard for economy let alone business class.

They basically left us alone except for serving the meal. three previous flights with Emirates have been much better. other aspects of the flight (on time check in etc were fine and the Dubai terminal is excellent).

The flight arrived on schedule. Boeing 777 cabin and its 1-2-1 herring bone layout with fully flat seats is my favorite. It offers spaciousness and privacy. The entertainment system offered a large collection of films that could be accessed on an easy to use control pad. Good selection of entrees, wines, and various snacks, bathrooms kept clean, and attentive flight attendants made the flight a very pleasant experience.

Luckily, i checked my mail on sunday the 4th, otherwise my whole travel plan would have been jeopardized. And when i call the support number, that person says there are two options - 1. He can cancel and refund or change the flight to take flights with layover in between And when i said i need to be in Vizag in the morning, he suggested a flight in the midnight i.e at 00.05 hours from Bangalore to Chennai and that the connecting flight to Vizag would be from Chennai in the morning at 6.50 i.e with a layover of 5 hours and when i asked if indigo can make any lounge arrangement for those 5 hours, he says that Indigo cannot help in that regard and that i need to take care of the stay during the layover. Since the airline changed the flight schedule, they should at least compensate with an arrangement to stay during the layover - (if we change they charge difference or if we cancel, they have t&c that there will be percentage deduction in the refunded amount.

The seats are not very different to Lufthansa and while confortable, they are long way below leading airlines and you get no private area from next to you passenger.

But I was sat next to a customer who spent much of the flight shouting across to a passenger 3 seats away, he kept spitting into the air sickness bag, and I felt quite ill and very tired by the time we got off. I talked to cabin attendants about this and they seemed to find it very funny and said and did nothing. When the meal was cleared away, they did not come into the cabin until 2 hours before landing in Beijing. Because I was kept awake by this man spitting and shouting I tried to watch movies but the selection on Air China is very poor and not suited to Western tastes.

I have had consistently good service with them over the last 40 years I have flown with them (and I am not an employee!) AC Rouge is a leisure carrier and not a five star airline like Emirates. You get what you pay for. Granted AC seriously screwed up by replacing out some of their key regular services with Rouge without telling customers. Not cool. That being said this little airline is not bad. The crews while young are actually very pleasant and eager to please. The uniforms are smart and they seem proud to wear them (the hats are a nice touch too. The food was tasty and satisfying. Not super high class but nice to get something that didn't make you gag. The service was attentive and I appreciated the new premium seating in the 767's. My airplane was clean (even after a quick turnaround after a 6 hour weather delay). My only wish is that they had service like Sunwing where everyone got a meal and there was inflight entertainment (even on the screens overhead) for all. Personally this airline is ok to fly for flights that are under 6 hours. Given the limited legroom do spend the money and fly the other classes. They give you more room and more attention.

I chose to be delivered at home which they did. I got my bags everything was there and perfect. Thank you SAA for your service.",Promoter
We booked and paid for exit row (long leg) seats (Â£80) for our flight from Madrid to Santiago but on check-in found we had been bumped back to seat 28 and not even sitting beside each other. Because we flew from London first we complained at check-in in London but they couldn't do anything about it. Then asked about it again in Madrid and they said it was too late as someone else had been allocated our seats and they didn't want to upset them. My partner was furious as we are Oneworld Emerald Frequent Flyers and this is a Oneworld partner airline. He is very tall and had especially booked the extra leg room seats. We are dreading the return flight next week as this sort of thing is really upsetting especially when the staff sympathised with us and said Iberia often do these things.,Detractor
Melbourne to Brisbane. Already checked in online but due to my request to link it to another booking passenger had to go to checkin for boarding pass. Very quiet no queues.

" Singapore to London. This was the second part of my Sydney to London trip and looked forward to it as it was on a BA A380. Now this aircraft, in Qantas colours, is one I am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with QF. As mentioned in my review of BA16 (which was the first leg of this trip) it is the on board soft product that is the problem. The same comments for that review apply here. The IFE is a work of mystery in terms of content. On Qantas, American, Cathay one gets a really good mix of old and new movies, great music choices. Those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning (Godfather, Gladiator, Brave-heart, Roman Holiday etc) are all things we as passengers want to see. Some smart edgy team in Soho, London pulled the content together forgetting that not everyone is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff. IFE is one thing on long haul. The other is food and beverage. The food quality was just substandard and something I read about constantly. On Qantas (say QF1 from Singapore to London) one gets the evening meal service, followed by Weiss ice cream, a Lindt chocolate along the way, midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast (fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc. At the rear of the main deck is a snack bar and in the galley will be found, chocolates, banana bread, cheese and biscuits. You would need to be really hungry to get through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered. BA need to get away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between. The A380 is a flagship aircraft and on Qantas it is treated as such. I am a Qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes. Put the smartest, best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember. The BA crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls. One guy looked like Steptoe (for those who remember) and was a miserable. Flying on an A380 should be an experience and I enjoy all my trips on that aircraft. BA have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from one point to another. That is sad given the stature of BA. I came back on BA31 from London to Hong Kong and the same comments apply. Hard product is fine (except for no snack bar) but the soft product is lacking severely.",Detractor
" Phoenix to Washington via Atlanta. Southwest Airlines flight attendants are friendly, down to earth, professional and the aircraft is comfortable. There was a weather delay however the electronic updates were very user friendly and kept me well informed of my flight status. I like Southwest Airlines because they invest in modern technology not just for the aircraft but you are able to use the internet, also when boarding there are electronic/modern technology used. The attendant announces the boarding class and seat (which sometimes it is hard to hear in the airport or due to the person speaking) but South West electronic devices for the lines alerts with the seat or boarding zone so you can visually read it which is good for people who maybe hearing impaired. Also the flight attendants uniforms are not too professional making the customers feel more at ease. Great job Southwest! Also it is important to provide snacks and juice it refreshes the flyer and that shows good customer service and accommodation that you care for your friendly flyers. Thank you!",Promoter
We flew Air Canada thinking we'll be getting a basic level of comfort common to all Air Canada planes but what a mistake. Didn't know about Rouge. There's no leg room minimal service no comfort no space in the overhead since people bring large carry-ons to avoid paying for checked-in luggage. The almost 5 hr flight to Phoenix from Toronto was painfully boring with the in-flight entertainment consisting of online streaming of old movies and shows. We had to bear all this again on the flight back!,Detractor
"  Dublin to Cape Town via Istanbul. First time flying Turkish Airlines. Check in and boarding all very efficient. Hadn't even been on an aircraft with a 2-4-2 seating arrangement, but this is perfect for couples (was travelling with fiancÃ©e) as no need to disturb anyone else if needing out of our seats. Cabin crew were professional and efficient in meal and drinks services. Enjoyed the safety video, if a bit cheesy! Some downsides would be only adequate leg room for a 6'3"" man like myself, expensive on board WIFI ($9.99 for a hour) and cabin crew turning a blind eye to foolhardy impatient passengers who insisted on getting up and opening the overhead lockers while the plane was still taxiing! Finally, I always believe it's good practice for a cabin crew member to do an announcement to welcome passengers to the destination, especially on a long haul flight, however this was not done on any of the four flights I took. No major complaints however and would fly with them again.",Passive
"Chiang Mai to Bangkok. At check in the staff asked if I have any connecting flight at BKK I told him that I have one to Singapore with another airline. He requested for the e-ticket and after checking informed me that my lay over time is about 80 mins and I have to collect my baggage at BKK airport and then check in again for the SG bound flight. In addition he made me sign an indemnity form stating that the Bangkok Air will not be responsible if I am unable to connect to my next flight. I bought the tickets fully aware of the risk of the short layover. While waiting at the boarding gate an airline staff approach my wife and I asked for our boarding passes then exchanged them with another set for 1st row seats so that we could disembark faster at BKK. We were really grateful for their thoughtfulness. Though it was a short 1-hr flight full inflight meals were provided. The safety video was awesomely done with a catchy song and dance number at the beginning and end to draw your attention. The flight arrived BKK about 10 min ahead of schedule and as we disembarked we were again approached by a staff with a piece of paper written on it our connecting flight number. We acknowledged that the flight number was correct and she replied ""The check-in counter is E1"". I was blown away by their excellent service. They do not have to go through such lengths but they did. They made my day and I will definitely flying with them again.",Promoter
"  A miserable experience with American Airlines from Miami to Quito. Flight was delayed 2 hours and then it started raining heavily so it was delayed 4 further hours. At the airport counter nobody seemed to care about giving out any information. When we finally got on the plane, to our business class seats, everything was dirty and smelt horrible. We had to wait an extra 45 minutes inside the plane because they had forgotten to bring some of the luggage onboard the plane. Business class cabin crew served dinner and nuts and that was that. Never even tried to make the flight a good experience after more than 8 hours of delay. So much turbulence during the flight and a horrible landing. Our experience was terrible. Business class was not worth it and we even had to wait a long time for our bags.",Detractor
"I have flown Emirates 3 times in the last six months but clearly customer loyalty means nothing to them. My mother, brother and I are scheduled to fly with them to Italy tomorrow for my brother's 21st birthday but we got a call from them today (less than 24 hours before our flight) to say that our flight has been cancelled and we have been moved to another flight. The problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in Rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in Dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in Dubai! I have called Emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do. We are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day, have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. Very disappointing.

I was booked to fly on NZ103 from Auckland to Sydney having not long arrived on NZ5 from LAX. We were supposed to be flying on a 777-200 but Air NZ had changed this to a brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. What a bonus that turned out to be the aircraft was almost empty I had a whole three seat row to myself in the rear cabin and the new aircraft was absolutely brilliant to fly on.

I couldn't care less if the flight attendants are happy or sad or dressed like an 80's boy band. I also couldn't care less about the inflight entertainment or the food they serve. However I do expect a comfortable seat. At 6'2 200 lbs I was unable to move my legs throughout the flight. My knees were firmly lodged into the seat in front of me as well as a metal armrest on the widow side. I couldn't utilize the space under the seat for extra leg room because the pitch of the seats. It was without a doubt the most uncomfortable flight I have ever had to endure. Luckily the couple in front of me (the gentleman was also jammed into his seat) looked back and we're horrified by how I was crammed into the seat and didn't recline their seat back otherwise It would have been unbearable. My flight was only 2.5 hour so I can't even fathom being on a 6 or 8 hour flight with this airline. I have always been a big fan of Air Canada but I will never I repeat never fly Rouge again even if I was given tickets.,Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Paris. Air France prices are way over the top and simply not justified. First Class cabin on A380 is on lower level of plane by entrance of plane so draughty and passengers from other classes passing through cabin. Seats are OK but the pop up screen for in-flight entertainment was small and totally archaic. Food really nothing special (should be one area where AF could excel - cheese selection was pathetic) and no first class treats like caviar. Good wines but white wine arrived as I was finishing my starter - only 4 people in cabin. Cabin crew not very professional - seemed to spend a lot of time just talking to each other. Air France needs a wake up call as it is surpassed in cabin quality, food, service by virtually every other airline flying between Asia and Europe. So far behind Emirates, Qatar etc - it is almost embarrassing.",Detractor
I flew Emirates for the first time return Glasgow to Dubai. My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow). Both my drivers were excellent cars were extremely comfortable and on time. I will most certainly be using Emirate again in the future.,Promoter

"  Los Angeles to Rome via London with British Airways. Our flight from LAX to Rome was on time and generally good. We upgraded from Economy to Premium Economy at the airport for $382 each. We had tried to upgrade ahead of time with our frequent flyer points but could not because we booked through Costco (Costco said we needed to go thru BA and BA said we had to go thru Costco). Boarding was not well organized. Our flight from London was delayed and we had a difficult time finding out where to go as the airport departures board did not list a gate and departure time kept changing. One BA associate told us it would probably leave from gate 18 which proved to be incorrect information. We finally asked an attendant at a random gate who looked it up on her iPad. We had to sprint back to gate 1 with 15 minutes until departure. When we arrived at that gate, we were told we would be bussed to our gate. We waited another 25 minutes for buses. Seats were fairly comfortable. Food was just okay - the small steak served was over cooked and as hard as rock. We arrived in Rome almost 2 hours late. Coming home we traveled economy as we decided the charge to upgrade on the way there was not a good value. Our flight from Rome to London was late in arriving which made us almost an hour late taking off from Rome. Boarding was chaotic and you couldn't understand the announcements being made about who was to board and when. Other people were turned back rather rudely by BA staff. Everyone seemed confused. Snack on board was small but tasty. We had to be ""express serviced"" through security in London in order to catch our connecting flight. No time to catch a snack or use the toilet. Boarding was in-process when we arrived at the gate. Then we sat on the tarmac for an hour before we could take off. Seats were very narrow and close together to the point that when the person in front of you reclined their seat, the back of the seat was very close to your face. You had to ""go horizontal""in order to get in and out of the seat to use the rest room. Arm rests between seats and at the end of the row did not lift up entirely so you had to slide over the arm rests. Food was pretty good. On board entertainment was good. Service was slow, forcing you to sit for an extended length of time with a tray squeezed in front of you. Our luggage is on an extended vacation as it did not make it to our flight in London. We arrived 25 minutes late to LAX. I also take exception to the $90 luggage charge ""per leg of the trip"" for our 2nd bag. 1st bag is no charge but $380 (round trip) charge for the 2nd bag is very steep.",Detractor
"Had a 6Â½ hr delay leaving Doha, but the Qatar Airways onboard experience with their quality foods and beverages by excellent cabin crew made the flight pleasant. However, this flight was terrorized by a 2-year-old toddler who screamed and cried and shouted nonstop without any attempts from her parents to comfort her nor trying to keep her volumes down. This was an insult to other passengers in Business Class and felt like being at a busy McDonalds for 7Â½ hrs. May we suggest Qatar Airways to introduce quiet zones on your aircraft for people who want to relax and enjoy a quality experience in peace and quiet? This has happened several times over the years and, unfortunately, on QR as well: some families are simply unable to make the distinction between their homes and public places nor seem to have the capacity to think about others who would like to enjoy their flights - or just take a rest. I don't fly to make friends but I always respect the privacy of my fellow travellers without putting them into such noisy, ugly nor ill-tempered torture, which was the case on QR852 from DOH to KUL this time. QR is a quality airline and I hope they find innovative solutions to this problem in the long run.",Promoter
"  I fly between Dublin and Manchester most weeks. With Aer Lingus, the flight is usually reasonably comfortable - the arrival process is often a nightmare. Arriving at Dublin late at night, the aircraft usually parks away from Terminal 2 and there is a long long walk through a labyrinth of internal corridors. As noted by another reviewer, if it is an Aer Lingus regional flight, a compulsory bus tour of Dublin Airport is added to the experience. Arriving at Manchester on Aer Lingus also involves being bussed around that airport. Last Monday, the ground crew decided to economise on the number of buses. Our bus took an age to get to Arrivals. A hot day and severe overcrowding on the bus caused some passengers to panic. Not a pleasant experience. Aer Lingus does not speak to passengers. I could not find a phone number and I am told that Customer Services doesn't have a phone. Very good for cost control and efficiency, I am sure. Not so good if they want repeat business. Aer Lingus advertises itself as Ireland's only four star airline and I think it likes to portray itself as a traditional full service airline. Where UK/European flights are concerned, I think it's definitely a no frills offering.",Detractor

I was told my number was correct and I had to wait until 24 hrs before flying, still did not work, called 3 times on day of flight as wanted to check in to ensure my family sat together, was then told booking number was incorrect and to try a different one, still no good, eventually paid extra over the phone to reserve seats. When getting to the airport I was told to check in at a machine, guess what? Booking not recognised again so queued up. There was a very long queue and only 2 desks open, 2 other staff just sat there filling in forms, we queued for nearly an hour and was down to 50 mins to departure. I spoke to staff several times to open other desks but they said others were busy and most staff were at the gates, eventually got to the desk to be told my seats had been given to other passengers despite me showing my email confirmation, again they were uninterested and shrugged shouldsers, my family ended up all split up including quite young daughters. The plane was the worse legroom I have had for a near 6hr flight, extremely cramped and uncomfortable.

"  Lisbon to Heathrow on British Airways. I booked my ticket with a reputable travel agency and yet when I went to check-in online the BA website said I had been sold a seat-only flight. The travel agency disagreed and showed me they had booked a seat with a baggage allowance. I called BA and was messed around by their staff member. I had to pay an outrageous fee to have 1 bag of only 12 kg fly in the hold with me to London. At Lisbon airport things were hectic as the previous day their security people had been on strike. The departure board did not show the check-in area for the BA flights. I had to find my own way to where BA check-in. I joined a queue and was outraged when one of the check-in staff allowed a woman with 3 kids to queue jump. When other people objected including other families in the long queue with children the check-in agent did nothing and allowed the woman to get away with not queuing. The check-in lady I dealt with was very pleasant and cheerful. The departure from Lisbon was exceptionally busy with not one empty seat. The cabin crew were very professional. The departure was on time and during the flight a snack and drink was served. My seat was very comfortable and the drop-down screens showed the route followed. Arrival was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Baggage on this flight is an issue in my opinion as too many passengers were allowed to bring on to the flight quite sizeable bags. When things go well, BA is excellent. However, charges for baggage are outrageous and place BA in the same category as budget airlines. I give top marks to the hardworking and very professional cabin-crew though.",Passive

"We flew Economy from SeaTac to Narita in October 2012 on the 787 and the flight seating was comfortable enough. The in-flight entertainment was excellent and the food & service very good. This year we took the same ANA Economy flight from SeaTac to Narita in October 2013 and the flight seating was terrible. In the past year ANA has changed the main Economy seating configuration from 2-3-2 to 3-3-3 and reduced the amount of space between seat rows to squeeze in more ""sardines into the same can"". It is so tight that the person directly in front has to move their seat to the upright position to adequately allow the food trays to fit onto the very small fold out tray. As well the newly instituted one (1) suitcase rule is very inadequate for those of us going for extended trips. Since the return flight home was re-directed to Portland OR due to ""fog/visibility problems"" at SeaTac and a series of subsequent problems our flight finally arrived ~8 hours late and this afforded an opportunity to speak with many other passengers. I found that many/most other passengers in the Economy cabin were of the same general opinion and would now strongly consider other options for their next trip. Options including flying to SF or Vancouver to get a more comfortable flight. ANA had a good product and through these changes of seat configuration has now given other carriers offering direct flights to Japan an excellent opportunity to compete and beat. We are now ""in-play"" and will not take another ANA flight to Japan w/o first understanding more about the seating arrangement.

" Flew Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita with Singapore Airlines. Pleasant Crew, food OK. Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok, seats great because it's still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that it's a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool. Also like other rules I've never experienced before with competing carries. I was told that because I was at the bulkhead, if there was turbulence I'd have to restore my back.

I also like the no fuss nature the airplane comes in people get off the next lot get on and it takes off again. It's great if you just want to get from A to B. The two checked bag allowance is a win as I arrived in the US on an international flight with 2 bags so it was helpful to have these included without additional cost (as many/all other US airlines charged). I will continue to fly SouthWest when I visit the US.,Promoter
Yangon to Adelaide via Singapore and a great experience with Singapore Airlines. The food has improved since previous journeys. Crew friendly and happy to help.

" Hong Kong to Sydney. Final leg of a trip from the UK. The previous three sectors were on BA metal and this on Cathay. It was on an A330 -300 which is one of my favourite aircraft. Reasonably quiet, easy to get on and off and very comfortable to ride in. CX has always had a good product on both the hard, aircraft, side and then the soft skills. Typically Asian service, efficient and with a smile. The IFE was good with plenty of choice for a mid haul of 9 hours. I declined the breakfast service (congee, fruit or eggs) as 4 am is a bit rich and early for my palate. The fact that there was little to say about this leg is a testament to the CX product.",Promoter
"Flew Egyptair and the flight was almost empty from Bangkok to Jakarta. The check-in staff were helpful. The economy cabin was not clean and I could still see a lot of rubbish from the previous flight. The cabin crew were unfriendly and rude. They did not welcome passengers entering the aircraft. The food was served very quickly. I only had 5 minutes to enjoy my foods and suddenly the cabin crew just took back my unfinished food without asking if I was ready or not. The price for Bangkok to Jakarta sector was OK for the full service airline, in comparison with other airlines which offer the route. I do not recommend this airline and will not book flights with them in the future.",Detractor
"  Melbourne to Casablanca via Doha, returning from Barcelona. Very good business class product by Qatar Airways. Boeing 777 from Melbourne offers a very comfortable space. Slept well on both legs, as the cabin was slightly cooler making it comfortable (even through lots of turbulence DOH to MEL). Flight attendants were very attentive on all legs, although they were not quite ready to greet customers on the DOH to MEL flight, but quickly made up for it once on board and seated. Flew on the Dreamliner from Doha to Casablanca and I found it very stuffy. The seating arrangement was ok, but lacked the space of the Boeing 777. Barcelona to Doha, I sat next to a employee of Qatar (I believe a senior member) who was very well cared for by the attendants which as a paying customer was interesting to observe this attentiveness. He is very proud of Qatar Airways and their product which is good to hear the other side. I will be flying with them again in late August and look forward to the experience in the A380.",Promoter

" On May 30th, 2018 my husband, mother and myself were supposed to catch our flight from Delhi to Goa with Indigo. However, the day before our flight we received a message stating that our terminal had changed due to renovations in the airport. My husband had called the airlines to confirm and was told that our terminal had in fact changed. Once we arrived at the Delhi airport, security wouldn't let us inside the airport and he kept telling us we were in the wrong terminal. We told him that the airlines themselves had confirmed about the terminal change, but he still didn't want to let us in and asked us to go to the Indigo customer care outside of the airport. When we went inside the customer service area it was already packed with other passengers and we had to wait a long time before we were greeted by the only one Indigo agent that was there. After we explained the situation to the gentleman, he called his manager to help us. The manager took at least 15-20 minutes before he came down (after the agent called numerous times). When we re-explained the situation the manager told us he can't help us and left mid-conversation, baffling both my husband and I with such horrible customer service, especially from someone in management, The manager left another agent to â€œdealâ€ with us that was even less helpful. By this time, boarding to the plane had started and we were still stuck with the agent telling us she couldn't do anything. We asked instead of giving us full credit to book us another flight and we would pay the difference but she did not want to do that. She said we will have to pay in full for the flights and we would not be reimbursed. By this time, all early flights were gone, and by the time we finally checked ourselves to book another flight with another airlines all flights to Goa for May 30th were booked. We booked our flight with Fly Air for 6 times the original price and had to book a hotel for another night at Delhi. We called the hotel in Goa to advise them we wouldn't make it to the hotel that day, but rather the following afternoon and asked if we would be able to get a credit for that day, but unfortunately we couldn't. Because of the service from Indigo airlines and wrong information given to us by them, we had to spend 6 times the price of our original flights, lost 1 day of hotel in Goa and had to book another extra night in Delhi.",Detractor

Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional Â£200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you Â£213.

"  This particular flight took me from Lisbon to Miami. Unfortunately, it was in an older version of the A330 so the entertainment was lacking. Instead of interactive, the movies all started on a 2 hour schedule. The bad part was that there were 2 channels dedicated to each movie and channels 1-2 weren't being used. Thus, you ended up 5 movies instead of 13. Not a big deal, but had I known, I probably would have flown back through New York. The service was good as always as was the food. For lunch they served the ubiquitous salted co, in this case made with cream (which happens to be my favorite). The pre-landing snack was not at all my cup of tea. It was a piece of bread with a side of mortadela and cheese so that you could build your own sandwich. The seats were very comfortable and even had the small foot rest which is rare these days.

After that, I asked to reimburse me for what I paid but no use. I called customer service many times and every time they said we will talk to you later. I sent 3 different mails but there was no response. Again, I contacted them through their web page at facebook and asked someone to call me but they gave me more than 10 promises but no one called me. They have the worst customer service ever.

Laung Prabang-Bangkok. At first I was a bit apprehensive about flying on a local Asian airline. I soon discovered that the service and standard were far superior to most European short haul airlines. The flight departed and arrived on time in difficult conditions. Access to the airport lounge in Luang Prabang was included. The lounge was quite basic but appreciated with a free snack and refreshment. The in flight cabin on the ATR72 was quiet small but comfortable. The food served on board was excellent.

" Newark to Hong Kong. This is the airline with the worst customer service that we have ever experienced. We were travelling to attend a wedding. We drove 3 hours to the airport with no indication of the airline being delayed or diverted. After parking and arrived at the departure hall, we were approached by the crew members that our flight has been diverted to Toronto due to weather. We were asked to wait for further information. We arrived around 10:00 pm with departure time at 1:30 am. After 1.5 hour wait, we were told the flight has been canceled and we were to call the numbers on the sheet of paper that we were handed out. We were appalled! There are around 10 CX uniformed employees there and were not doing any re-booking or issuing any vouchers or do anything but to tell us to call and keep calling. Of course we couldn't get through. After trying for a while with no success, we decided to drive back as there was no point waiting at the airport since no one could help us there. Couldn't get through until 3 am in the morning and they said there are no flights available for us to reach our destination on time. We had to cancel and still waiting to see if we can get refunded. Called my family to convey the bad news to them. Our kids were extremely disappointed as they were supposed to be the flower girl and boy. We had a luggage of kids favor to hand out at the wedding as well. Our family had to seek alternatives last minute. I cannot believe it with my own eyes that this is happening.

"Flew IST-SIN SIN-SYD on B777-200. One of the aircraft had been ""refitted"". Both had quite hard seats. For the first sector I was seated in 51A which on a night flight gets a direct beam of light coming from the toilets on a regular basis. It's quite disturbing and I wouldn't recommend this seat to economy passengers in this part of the cabin. The inflight entertainment is dated and the screens quite small compared to other aircraft in the SIA fleet and other airlines particularly the second sector where the screen was exceptionally small. This must have been one of the oldest aircraft in the SIA fleet. It seems SIA reserve their ageing aircraft for the IST route. The inflight service on both legs of the journey was very average. I ordered a special meal so received my meal first however it took over an hour to get a drink to go with my meal which is served when the rest of the meals are served. I think there is some room for improvement here from SIA. I was surprised to have to remind the cabin crew about my missing drink as normally their service is second to none. The food was fine and well above average although the coffee not always hot. Check in staff were quite good at IST and as with almost every flight I have ever taken departing from Ataturk Airport it was a delayed departure - this flight by 45 minutes.",Passive

And when getting ready for landing, she grabbed bags some people were holding and shove it under the seat in front, without asking them to do so due to landing shortly. At the end of the flight, as I was walking past her, she didn't say bye to me. I decided to say thank you to her to see if she would at least acknowledge me, but she looked away from me and did not respond.",Detractor

A heartwarming moment sticks in my mind: on one flight to Kiev, in the dead of winter, I forgot where I had left my coat.

I sat on the upper deck which was full but this did not detract from the excellent service provided by the two dedicated crew. I chose this seat as no one has to step over your feet when they exit and it is also a fraction longer than the other seats with three windows and four compartments beneath the window to store items. I did not use the seat as a bed but used the Z position which is very good for relaxing. The food and wine choices were very good and the Club Kitchen was well stocked on the main deck for treats after dinner.,Promoter

Pitch and recline are inadequate and the seats are very uncomfortable beyond one or two hours of flying. They can cut the blood circulation to your legs. Trying to find a comfortable position for sleeping during a night flight is impossible and caused me to experience leg cramps. Never again. There is no priority security clearance at Toronto Pearson airport, or at Keflavik airport. Food was OK and staff pleasant, but the airline is unsuitable for anything but short-haul day flights until they improve business class comfort and provide priority service for passengers paying the premium prices. On the return, at Keflavik we endured standing 45 minutes in a bus to go from the gate to the plane because they loaded the passengers onto the bus long before the plane was ready to receive us.

"London Gatwick to New York JFK return. Booked my flight 6 months before flying, and paid extra for checked baggage but declined seat choice and food option. Received several emails advising me of changes to my flight times. Luckily they were only minor changes (+/- 20mins). Once confirmed that I'd read and agreed to the flight changes, I was sent amended e-tickets. The day of my outbound flight dawned and I received a text on the way to the airport wishing me a happy flight and letting me know times/booking details. Online check-in not available for international flights, which is a shame but not too much of an inconvenience. Got to the airport 3.5hrs before the flight departed. Check in was quick and easy. All window seats were taken but friendly check-in staff put me in an aisle seat with an empty middle seat next to it (luckily this remained empty). Boarding was done by seat rows, and completed in an orderly manner. Flight took off about 10 mins late. I can't fault the in-flight experience. The plane was a new Dreamliner. Clean, bright and airy with effective air conditioning and apparently, more oxygen to help with jetlag (I don't really get jetlag so can't confirm this). Touchscreen entertainments system was great. Lots of movies/TV/music to choose from. USB socket to charge your phone/tablets etc. Staff friendly. As I hadn't opted for an in-flight meal, I took some sandwiches and snacks with me. I also took an empty litre bottle through security and filled it up airside. No pillows supplied but had my own neck pillow. Blankets are available for a fee (Â£3) but I have my own fleece travel blanket so took that. Headphones can also be purchased but it's a standard single-pin, 3.5mm jack socket so any headphones should work. Uneventful flight landed at JFK ahead of schedule. Return flight experience much the same. Took off an hour late due to an issue with the baggage conveyor belt, but made up time in the air. Very glad of my fleece blanket as it did get a bit nippy at times. Landed about 20mins late but from parking at the gate to getting picked up at the pick up/drop off point took 25mins (including passport control and baggage collection).

First problem: It is not true that you can add other baggage online once you've booked online and paid for your baggage. What they declare on their website is false. We had 1 booked suitcase going to Prague and we needed to carry 2 booked suitcases to come back. We had to pay an extra 65 Euros at the airport to add 1 booked suitcase. Second problem: going to Prague the dimensions of my cabin suitcase were ok. Coming back they did not conform to the standard anymore (2 cm. higher). Will never fly Wizzair again.,Detractor

AF Premium Economy is an upgrade to an already good Economy product at least on the Airbus A380. Noteworthy - and better than on BA - is that on short-haul flights to Pairs with Air France PE passengers are seated in Business and receive business class service. Only the middle seat is not free as in Business. On my flight from CDG to SFO the crew were very friendly the food was good and the PE seats provide a lot of private space. I could sleep for a few hours but people who complain that the shell seats are too hard will be pleased to hear that AF also replaces the cushions in the A380 seats (and improve the touchscreen). You get an amenity kit sky priority boarding and check in plus a slightly better main meal. No pre-flight cocktails and certainly not the enhanced catering as on Air New Zealand. However if you need to work and/or want to watch a few movies in a comfortable environment and cannot afford business class then AF PE is definitely worth checking out.,Promoter
" Vienna to Hamburg. Another delay and the boarding gate is not capable of announcing delays and by saying that boarding starts a few minutes later instead of 45 min later.

From my personal point of view, this venture has destroyed the Lufthansa brand.",Detractor
Toronto to London Heathrow - 26/10/14. After reading how the 747's are really starting to show their age I opted to fly this return route on board the new 787 that BA has to offer. The outbound flight in economy a week earlier had been great food and entertainment was good staff very pleasant but it was a bit of a tight squeeze in the seats I think a 2-3-2 configuration would work a bit better. I arrived at Pearson Airport Terminal 3 booked to return to London in World Traveller Plus. Visited the Premium Plaza Lounge nice and comfy but nothing special. Boarding was really rather chaotic but I was delighted to be upgraded to Business Class at the gate! Seat 3F was a good aisle seat very comfortable spacious plenty of storage space and close to the toilets which I find more useful than bothersome there was never any queue to use them that could've disturbed me. Cabin crew were superb and attentive always addressing by name and happy to help with any queries and requests. The drinks service and the quality of the food was excellent beef tenderloin followed by lemon tart and well presented. Whilst I generally struggle to sleep on flights I found the flat bed very comfortable indeed especially with the mood lighting on this night flight. Breakfast a fruit salad and selection of pastries was again very pleasant to start the morning. On time departure and arrival from Gate C66 at T5 through border control and luggage collected took just 25 minutes. Overall highly impressive from British Airways would absolutely use Club World again.,Promoter
"  My red-eye flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco with American Airlines was supposed to be nonstop. Upon arrival to the boarding gate, the American posting board still read nonstop, and only at last minute were we informed that the plane would make a fuel stop in Kansas City. As this was a full flight, there was no overhead space for my carry-on so there I was stuck having to jam my luggage and backpack under the seat with no place for my feet. We sat on the ground for an hour, and ultimately arrived 2-hours late at our destination. A review of the AA615 activity log indicates this is not an uncommon occurrence. Some missed connections, I missed a lunch meeting. It is unacceptable to have an airline presumably save a few bucks on fuel at their passengers' expense. This seemingly selfish unapologetic action significantly tainted an otherwise OK flying experience.",Detractor

I arrived at LAX well before the flight time and proceeded to check my baggage.

That was a big mistake. Spirit Airlines charges 100 US Dollars for a carry-on bag! The flight was fine, but since I was in an Airbus A320, the seats did not recline.

Flown SZX-PEK (Shenzhen-Beijing) on an A380 business class on upper-deck last week (they call this first class in domestic and biz class on international flights). Check-in and security was fast. A long walk to the lounge and the gate at the new Shenzhen Airport. Lounge was mediocre. Priority boarding good. Now about the flight itself. Good things: seats very good comfortable and lie-flat a light quilt and soft pillows placed at every seat. IFE was very nice with headphones and lots of movies and other videos to watch but the ads are a bit annoying but can be fast-forward. Now the bad part. Staff didn't smile much makes you feel you're not welcomed. The A380 seemed under-staffed and I had to wait 10 minutes for a drink refill. Food seemed a little unfresh a mysterious sauce and meat? In general China Southern has 5-star hardware and 3-star staff and service in my opinion. I had used my FFP miles for this flight but if I had actually paid I might not be happy with the service quality.,Passive
"Copenhagen to Tel Aviv via Istanbul. First of all it was delayed so we missed our connecting flight and had to wait 5 hours for the next in Istanbul. The pre-ordered pre-paid food did not come. We asked both in Copenhagen and Istanbul and were assured our food would be there. The staff on the flight did not care. They did not want to help. We proved we had paid food but they said we have to email Pegasus for a return of money and buy food onboard. We could not get food for the amount we already paid. The email was sent a week ago and still no reply. I will never fly with this company again and I advice everyone to choose another company. They are not serious. The airport they dump people is not the ordinary airport but a small place with only few toilets that are not even clean. If you want to have a good vacation, don't travel with Pegasus.

6 May 2014: Las Vegas to Gatwick. Boeing 777. Back on BA again thanks to Avios Companion coupon. Cabin crew are now more present throughout the journey but not experienced any of them going too far to please a customer it seems just okay if they run out of a meal choice or if friends not seated together. Certainly yesterday cleaning the wc was not on the duty list. I've flown AF TAP SWISS KLM long haul in the past year and by far BA catering in economy is the poorest in content.

  Montreal to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Quick check-in and boarding. The hard product is comfortable but lacks privacy due to 2x2x2 configuration of the business class cabin which means no direct aisle access for all seats. The FA's were pleasant and professional although their English was not very good. Food quality was average and below their historical standards. Toilets were kept reasonably clean and tidy throughout the journey. IFE had many choices but list of films needed an update with very few recent releases. Flight left on time and arrived a full hour ahead of schedule. The disembarkation via buses remains a total nuisance and mystery as there were plenty of vacant air bridges.

We had a slight delay on a return journey but we were kept informed. Our most recent trip, to Mallorca earlier this month, was typical of the reliable service we have always experienced from easyJet: we left on time and arrived early, the cabin crew worked hard without any fuss and the cockpit team kept us informed.

Rome to Perth October 17. Older 777. Good seats. IFE still bad but everything else good on to Rome to Singapore leg. The Singapore to Perth leg was not what you would expect from Singapore Airlines. The crew were really rushing everything. Not sure why as it was 5 hour flight. It looked like they had trainees on board and the older crew were exerting their authority. The cabin crew were almost running between points on the plane. The coffee service was with the meal and the jug was flayed around with speed and not much care. There was no respite this sort of rush continued all the way to landing. I am sure this is an isolated incident I will still fly with them though.,Detractor

Compared to my premium economy review, where I did say much about the airline, flying economy put me in a very bad seat, with little space, for a long haul not the best experience. And we were ""full house"", this adds even more to the bad experience. You get used to it but 10 hours are not pleasant. It was a daytime flight so I didn't need to sleep, which was good, given the seat and the entertainment system was well equipped with movies and series to keep me occupied for the whole flight.

The seats really are first rate and Cathay Pacific business is the equal of first on some airlines. The food and drink was also good. The only criticism would be that the lounge in Melbourne really is a bit small and the range of food and drink available are underwhelming. ZRH lounge is a bit better, but not great. If you are flying on to other destinations it's a bit of a drag to have to route your trip through ZRH and connections on the return trip may require a night spent at ZRH depending on the departure time. Cathay Pacific could turnover their IFE films a bit quicker, but no problem if your trip straddles two calendar months.",Promoter
" Chicago to Seville with a layover stop in Madrid. After booking the flight, I realized I spend the beginning part of my trip in Madrid.

I ended up buying a ticket on the same flights as my original booking - Iberia did not refund my money for the flights they cancelled. I submitted a complaint through Iberia's website on November 28th in which I requested a refund for the flights they cancelled. I received this response on December 22nd: ""Certain fares do not accept refund and have a number of limitations with regard to changes in the route or sequence of reserved routes.

" Nashville to Savannah via Charlotte. I bought two round-trip tickets to SAV, the flights to Savannah were great and we had no problems what so ever. The problem was on the way home when they pushed our connecting flight up by 40 minutes while we were in flight to Charlotte. I don't understand how the crew can make that decision to move a flight up by 40 minutes, meaning we missed our connecting flight which was also the last flight of the night at 11:15pm. When I called AA support she informed me that the plane didn't actually leave the ground until 11:29 pm and there is no reason they shouldn't have let us on the plane. She then said to tell the agent that we need hotel vouchers to which the agent said ""no sorry we can't"" and the representative on the phone was baffled at her response. All of us that missed our connecting flight were then kicked out of 2 terminals, no hotel, no food or water, offered to us. The AA agents in the SAV airport did provide us with snacks and drinks for our 2 hour delay so I was astonished that nothing was provided for a 12 hour delay. We were not put on another flight until 8:55 am the following morning meaning we had extra fees charged for storing our cars, missing work, and sitters. What makes me even more mad is I filed a claim with AA claims department and they sent me back the most ""we don't care"" email. Saying that AA feels that their customers should have to pay for extra cost such as hotels, transportation, parking fees, storage fees, and any other fees that we were charged for missing our flight due to the airline changing their times. I have never felt so disrespected by a company as much as I have with American Airlines. I was not asking for my full refund because 3 out of 4 of my flights were great and the crew was awesome except for CLT and the service I have been given so far. All I wanted was my extra fees reimbursed. Very disappointed with how we were all treated.

"  Fed up with Finnair's intra-European stripped down European economy class with no decent food and just tasteless expensive snacks on offer, decided to try their business class between Helsinki and Paris. The on-line check-in is a breeze, like with most airlines these days. With no luggage, could head straight to the Priority security control. Otherwise, Helsinki airport is quite a mess and they've clearly forgotten the basic needs of travelling passengers, resulting in no space to sit down anywhere and very narrow corridors due to the fact that all space has been taken up by shops and food outlets. The Finnair Business lounge is bright with nice Scandinavian design, but even there, space is limited. Even the toilets are tiny and lack regular cleaning. Once on board the A320, a cheerful welcome by the cabin attendants who were trying to do their best, despite the limited cabin comfort and service offerings. With a fare of over â‚¬1,500, the only difference to Economy is that the middle seat is left free and that you get a meal, but without any choices. Alcoholic drinks are free if that's what you want but as in Economy, the coffee is horrific. No wonder fewer and fewer passengers opt for Finnar's European Business Class and I feel sorry for all those in transit from Finnair's Asian flights, expecting a true Business Class product, like in Asia.",Passive

The system didn't let it even if the check in lady try to do so. Probably because my booking was on stand by. However she put a priority tag on my bag which ended to come out fast in Geneva. The flight was quite full with very few seats left. The cabin crew was not very interacting with passengers. The service onboard was good and a hot meal was provided with a choice of drinks all free of charge. The inflight entertaiment was a video featuring some tourist attractions of some Greek islands. Overall Aegean airlines is a good and it offers a good range of destinations but they're limited only to Europe and some destinations to the Middle East. I would recommend this airline.,Promoter
  Chicago to0 Salt Lake City. It is ridiculous to be charged for a carry on bag. I paid to check my large bag and had to pay an additional $40 for my carry on. I have never been charged for a carry on before. I didn't have a personal item and my carry on was too large to be considered a personal item. The woman who checked me in at the counter was nice but the woman next to her was very rude and refused to help us. We were next in line so we approached the counter and she refused to help anyone from our line. She took a different customer from a separate line with no explanation. The third woman at the counter helped the people who were behind me in line. It was very obvious that we were next but could not get help. I have flown with frontier several times in the past and have not had any problems. I would prefer to pay a little more and not have any surprises when I check in and be treated with respect.,Detractor

"  London Heathrow to Hong Kong, and what separates a good airline from an excellent airline is how well it handles unexpected issues. My experience puts Cathay firmly in the excellent category. Half way into the flight (6 hours in) one of the passengers required urgent medical assistance. The pilot made the decision of turning the plane around and making an unscheldued stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The crew dealt with the situation extremely professionally. The stopover meant an extra 4 hours added to the journey, which meant I missed my connecting flight. On landing in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific staff were waiting to assist passengers with connecting flights. Amazingly they had already sorted out onward flights, new boarding passes and for those who had onward flights rearranged for the next day like me, they had already organised overnight accommodation and transfers. I didnt have to ask for anything! Every detail was explained and sorted out for me before I'd even stepped off the plane. That's why its worth paying a few pounds more for a decent airline, giving you peace of mind for if and when unexpected situations occur.",Promoter

" St Lucia to Gatwick on which my wife and I were both involuntarily downgraded from Premium Economy to Economy due overbooking on the flight. It should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at Vieux Fort Airport. I now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades. At the time of going through the baggage hall getting our boarding passes we queried them as none had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats would be allocated when we went through the departure gate. Once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the baggage hall when we were then told that my wife and I were being downgraded to economy. The male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we would be getting on the flight giving us Â£75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under Article 7.3 of EC 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights. He then told us he would find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again. The male who we spoke to in the baggage hall did not come and find us, we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and I on a row with no other passengers which we assumed, rightly or wrongly, was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from BA. However two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem. What further concerned me even more was one of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching Gatwick and after the Pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions, never telling the passenger to raise their seat. BA's latest advert celebrates 100 years of BA but for me their service is going backwards. The music that accompanies the advert is called â€˜Salvation' and by the end of the flight my wife and I were surely seeking it. Article 10 of EC Regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you.",Detractor

We have traveled twice in the last two months on this airline and found the service to be extremely slow the food awful. On our last trip we were in the air for over 6 hrs and I turned on my overhead light for service (another drink) only had one to that point as that was all that offered up till then. To be told we would be landing in 1 hr and I could wait till then and could my drinks for free at the resort. Very rude comment and also we were only landing to drop off people at Punta Cana and still had approx. another 3 hrs of air time. All four trips (2 to point of destination and 2 return) they had run out of tomato juice before they had got to our row 11. The movies were bad and then to have to watch 3 same re-runs of a sitcom after - that's bad. Both trips we thought were direct flights and only found out after we paid that there were stoppages on all. Not to mention delays at airports or on runway. Always was something going wrong!,Detractor
"We flew from OAK to Las Vegas 6/27/14. I was fully aware of their add on fees for everything so I won't be complaining about that. I have never flown Spirit so thought we would save some money but also worried that it was some type of chicken coup carrying fly by night airline and unfortunately it is. Not to mention I had 2 other couples with me and recommended Spirit to them. Now I understand there can be mechanical issues with planes but how it was handled was just horrible! Flight to leave at 2.10pm pilot comes on ""Ladies & Gentleman we need our mechanic to sign off on a repair should be 5-10 minutes"". ""Ladies & Gentlemen we can't find the mechanic and need to deplane should be 45 minutes"". 2 hours later ""we still can't find the mechanic"" then - ""we found the mechanic and he will be here in an hour"". It's now about 4pm. ""The mechanic is here and working on it"" ""the plane is fixed"" ""the plane is not fixed"" now it's 6pm and they say ""the plane is fixed and we will be boarding soon"". Happy Roars from the crowd at Gate 5. 8 pm ""we are sorry to say the plane is fixed but the pilots have timed out and we have no other pilots"". No ground crew no extra pilots just insane. Comedy of errors lies/misinformation no management no help getting new flights on other airlines and on and on. We rushed to get our bags and I literally had to go behind the counter to help and grab my bags and run to a real airline and overpay for two one way tickets to Vegas.

"A bit of a wait at the Business class check in but at least Business/Aegean Miles and Bonus Gold get to use the fast track passport control and security and the dingy Aegean Business class lounge. The lounge offered a reasonable selection of food and drink but not really high-end and the fact that 2 flights were leaving in short succession meant the lounge was fairly crowded at one point. Despite there being several vacant air bridge gates we had to suffer being bussed to a remote stand which involved no priority boarding and being herded onto a bus that was almost bulging at the seams by the time we left. There was a sort of welcome onboard by the cabin crew member as she was on the phone. Pre take off drinks were offered but without any real enthusiasm or engagement. After take off there was the usual hot towel, menu and drinks but no real customer engagement. The cabin crew member pushed the meal trolley into the cabin and set down the table mats and offered bread, placing it on the mat and moved on. A colleague had to tell her that she had forgotten to hand out meal trays. No apology, no making a joke of it, just a robotic performance of giving us our meal trays. That summed up the service. If you wanted anything you had to press the call button because even though various cabin crew floated through the cabin casually glancing at empty glasses at no time did they ask if anyone would like a refill. The liqueur trolley was pushed into the business class cabin but again it was something they had to do because it was in the service plan. London couldn't come quick enough. There was nothing really to thank them for. Cabin crew make the trip. At least the e-passport gates were quiet and after a 5 minute wait my bag was third on the carousel. A shambolic and lacklustre crew spoilt my Aegean business class experience. If this was my only Aegean experience I would never recommend it but thankfully it was my first bad encounter.",Detractor
My experience PEK-CAN on Mar 25 in Economy: If you are in economy do not expect good seat pitch and no entertaining at all on board on a A330-300 that I'm not sure if the color is Beige or use to be white and is ageing. Bring your drinks on board because they only offer Pepsi Seven Up and Water. Do not drink the coffee its horrible. The offer me dinner that I had to leave intact because it has very bad appearance for a western guy like me. I saw everyone eating it but not me. In my opinion they are following very close to UA were economy is just a Low cost carrier offer with very bad international and domestic service.

"LAS-ORD Nov 15 2014. ORD-MSY Jan 14 2014. MSY-ORD Jan 17 2014. Some people are just ruthless. Yes you pay for everything but even then it is probably still cheaper than a traditional airline. A simple google of their additional fees (such as their baggage fees carryon fees printed ticket feeds etc.) and you will see them. Many flight delays and cancellations are not even controlled by the airline. I have flown them twice so far and it was uneventful. A situation arose in which I had to cancel two of my flights. Their cancellation fees are crazy (something like 130 bucks each booking) and the rest is credited to your account. Well instead of cancelling the flight instantly like so many people do I waited a couple of weeks closer to the date. Sure enough they changed the flight time of my flight by only 15 minutes which allowed me to cancel my flight at no charge and receive a full flight credit back to be used on future air travel. I used my two round-trip tickets from Fort Myers to Chicago and on a 50 dollar off promotion day was able to book four total round-trip flights for only 15 bucks more (wanted a better flight time). I would have never been able to book like that on other airlines. Oh and the round-trip flights that came from that uneventful on-time sometimes early and on a nearly empty plane. This airline is not for you if you struggle to read what the cost of everything is and expect 5 star service. There is a reason this airline charges a ""bare fare"" because you are paying for you and a small bag not a small army. I have flown major carriers many times that incur huge delays and cancellations too. I understand the inconvenience that a delay or cancellation may cause but sometimes it is a part of flying. Everyone is so adamant about ""no cancellation fees"" or free baggage when I saved over 200 bucks round-trip to the same destination nearly months apart on everyone's seemingly favorite airline that starts with an S (not Spirit). Yes you get what you pay for and if you want to pay more for no baggage fees no cancellation fees no boarding ticket printing fees no carryon fees no drink fees etc. then pay for those items upfront like you do on other airlines. Me on the other hand I enjoy flying on an airline that charges me far less than other airlines and I can take twice as many trips with a little carryon than other airlines with a couple huge ""free"" bags and a little more leg room. At least Spirit charges by the item and doesn't group them all together like other airlines. If it costs you more to fly on Spirit than other airlines it is dare I say it probably your own responsibility. Nobody wants to take accountability for not reading these fees and that just doesn't fly with me. I had to cancel my flights knowing when I booked that if I did have to I would have to pay for it. And I did on one of them. Plain and simple just read and if you want a cancellation security blanket to tuck you in at night then please use another airline. Some of the delays and cancellations will happen on those airlines too.",Promoter

" Ho Chi Minh City to Guangzhou. Our flight, CZ368 on 28 March was scheduled to take off at 8:00am but after sitting in the plane for 2.5 hours later, we were told to get off the plane due to technical problems. There were no announcements or updates given once we get off the plane. China Southern barely provided any useful information or any staff presence in the next 12 hours.

At 5:00pm not a single staff showed up, 5:30pm rolled around and still no updates, finally at 5:40pm they made a PA announcement (still no staff) saying the new flight time is now 9:00pm.

Flew Mint Class from LAX to JFK and were impressed with the overall experience. We live in Asia and fly Business or First Class on some fantastic full service Asian based airlines but this Jetblue Mint experience can easily beat most of them. We took the 7am flight on a heavy 100 percent full A321 flight. The check in was smooth with a nice welcome from the ground staff. Our luggage were slightly oversize and above the max. 50 pounds allowance per piece but they were flexible on it hence we didn't need to pay the additional fees. We arrived around 5.30 am hence only a few passengers on the security check and didn't bother to use the express line. The boarding was announced at 6:15 am and the Mint passengers got to board first. We were seated in 3A and 3C which is perfect for couple even though the single suite with sliding door in front and the back of our seats row 2 and 4 were more private. The cabin crew were very helpful in explaining the Mint service seat functions and presented us with menu card. The welcome drink with or without vodka were a delight. It took us a while to learn the full features of the seat as they are so unique and not the usual features you find in other carriers. The thick blanket noise canceling headphones power point container for your phones and sunglasses are very thoughtful. The boarding was completed before 7am and the departure was on time. We got to choose 3 out of five meals prepared by Saxon+Parole which were delicious and nicely presented. The Icecream by blue marble and Mah Ze Dahr cookies in a box were of good quality. One feature we love the most is free and fast wifi as soon as we took off. The non stop TV entertainment although not AVOD was cool and we could watch it as soon as we sat down. The in-massage seat function helped us to relax and dozing off for most 5 hours and 30 minutes flight. I am 6 feet tall and I found the seat is comfortable and I was able to stretch flat out.

" Los Angeles to Chiang Mai via Seoul. We decided to spend a little bit more for our flight to Thailand in exchange for a better service and were disappointed: We could have saved several hundreds of dollars if we had used a Chinese budget airline. What was good about Korean Air were the flight attendants who were super friendly and helpful, on our return flight to LAX they even carried my carry on bag for me, when they saw that I was holding our baby. The reason why we won't fly with Korean Air anymore: I had ordered a ""vegetarian oriental meal"" (not vegan, but vegetarian which isn't as restrictive) What I received was a joke: it looked like someone had emptied half a can of peas into the aluminum container and thrown some bok choi leaves on top. No sauce, tofu, rice or potatoes. Horrible. My wife was still hungry after her meal and asked for a snack. The answer was: ""we don't carry any snacks"" (contrary to what their website says: ""Snack Service A wide variety of snacks, such as samgak kimbop, cup ramen, pizza, and makkoli rice cakes, are served on long flights."" The flight attendant explained: ""we stopped offering cup ramen because of the smell"" when my wife told him that she used to get ramen on previous flights. I had one can of beer at the beginning of the flight and ordered a gin tonic several hours later. This drink spilled because my table was defective (the kind which you pull out from the armrest). When I asked for another drink they watered it down and advised me ""this is your last drink, each passenger is allowed to have only 3 drinks"". I was not the slightest little bit drunken and very surprised because even on low budget airlines like Air India nobody told me how many drinks I could have. This is obviously a policy which is supposed to save the airline money. We both started to get a headache because of dehydration. When I asked for water, the flight attendant poured approximately 4 table spoons into a cup, I went back and forth several times between our seats and the pantry and each time they filled the cup only 50%. We were both thirsty during the entire flight. Before departure there was a bottle of water on each seat and as soon as the boarding was completed, they hurried to collect the water bottles from the vacant seats. (Probably in order to lock them up in the safe...) 5.) We had purchased an inflatable pillow which was specifically designed for air travel. As soon as my wife started to inflate the pillow, several flight attendants approached us saying that we were not allowed to use it. Obviously Korean Air's management made decisions in order to save money and we felt this nickel and dime culture during the entire trip. If we had chosen a low cost Chinese airline, we may have received some kind of rude treatment but enough to eat and drink for several hundred Dollars less.",Detractor

Short 50-minute hops on Dash 8 Q400s TLL-RIX and RIX-VNO. I had booked my tickets via an online booking agency so was dismayed to be informed on checking in at TLL that I would be charged a supplementary fee. Fearing that this would be a swoon-inducing off-the-scale penalty as imposed by certain budget airlines I was relieved that the charge was only EUR 10. Furthermore I was advised I could upgrade to an extra comfort seat with no-one next to me this for another EUR 20. Done deal off I went happy - only to discover that the flight was only one-third full and we all had ample space. Two days later at RIX I presented myself at the ticket sales desk to request payment of the check-in supplement only to be directed to a self-check-in machine at zero extra cost. This flight was also one-third full. At least I can say that Air Baltic was very charming when they relieved me of my EUR 30 at TLL.,Passive
"I understand that things sometimes happen which are beyond the control of the staff, and delays occur. However, my experience with United Airlines today was highly disappointing not only because of the delay (approximately three hours), but because of the lack of professionalism demonstrated by the staff. Our flight attendant was not apologetic about the long, expected delay at all, but was very rude toward several passengers. One of these passengers included a woman with a baby, from whom the flight attendant grumpily took a purse and roughly shoved it into the overhead. There were no apologies from the flight attendant as we de-boarded, after another smaller delay as we waited for a free gate, and she was not pleasant toward anyone, from what I observed. This is the fourth time I have experienced unexpected delays while flying United during the past four years or so, but the first time I have ever experienced such poor service.",Detractor
I am a regular AC traveller Vancouver to wherever x 25 years. I had my first Rouge experience this week to Dublin and was shocked and disgusted with all aspects of the flight. Staff seem to have been selected from Tim Hortons lineup and given camp counsellor training. With an average age of 21 I would not trust them to lead me out of my house much less off an airplane. Food inedible seats hard and tight and what an insult to not be told that there was no entertainment system onboard and a charge for a glass of wine. When I complained I was told that AC always charges for wine which is not the case on the regular long haul flights. Take offence when extra charges are sprung on me (iPad). I paid same as I would have for route through Heathrow: never again a Rouge flight.,Detractor

" Tampa to Los Angeles via Denver. Just beware of Southwest Airlines â€œBusiness selectâ€. When you use the word â€œBusinessâ€ in relation to air travel, it usually means: a wider seat, more legroom, better meal service, prioritised baggage and lounge access. If you tick the box and pay for this so called upgrade you get none of those things. Fair enough, you have some fare flexibility and the bags go free. Apart from that and a free drink coupon, you get an economy seat and economy treatment. You get to board early. And, it cost me a lot of money, a few hundred dollars for this so called upgrade - you could say that I should have taken the time to read the fine print, but I made the error of thinking that Business meant Business.

She only had a personal item and no luggage. I ordered her a wheelchair when I booked this ticket. She was told to have a seat and no one every came to get her. She was then told to go get her own wheelchair from the storage area. She had her boarding pass electronically on her phone. They refused to accept it and would not print her off a new one. She ended up missing her flight. She never even made it through security because they neglected to help her. She has a strong accent although she speaks English, but was told they didn't understand what she needed. They are now charging her $100 to rebook the ticket for 9:55 tonight. I have not been able to get anyone on the phone to resolve this issue. The airline supervisors have refused to speak to me so that I can advocate for my senior mother.

Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities.

When I say delayed I don't mean an hour. These flights are being delayed 3 hours, 7 hours, 24 hours. Flights are being cancelled and rebooked entirely. The customer service is giving me false reasons for the delays in order to protect them from being liable. I run a business and I am potentially losing multiple customers for my inability to be available to them, directly because of this airlines inability to put a flight together to take off at the time I paid for.

Flight 1914 on May 22 from Toronto to Barcelona / Flight 1915 on June 4 from Barcelona to Toronto. Onboard I began to look for the headphone plug and I was shocked to find out that there is no entertainment system available.â€¦No TV movies or music for a flight that is over 8 hours long. Only option was to rent an iPad and connect to the plane's WiFi but what do you do when you travel with all your family? You rent many iPads? Moreover what happens when your battery is empty again you are left with nothing to do but sit in the uncomfortable limited space that you have. Other bad points for Rouge on the flight back the overhead light was not working so we could not even read a book. Rouge does not offer individual climate control so if you are too hot there is nothing you can do to get a little more air. The crew wasn't so good they seem very disorganized and service was bad. When the meal service got to us we had no choice. We got our beverage long after the meal and again they ran out of a lot of selections. I would accept a lot of those inconveniences for a short/medium length flight but I cannot accept such conditions for long flights. Our experience with Air Canada Rouge was a disaster and I would never recommend Air Canada Rouge to anyone. And I will do all I can to avoid it in the future.,Detractor

" Boston to Madrid via Philadelphia. The worst airline I have ever used. Our flight from Philadelphia (which was a stopover) to Madrid was delayed because the IT people did not cross check the numbers against those on the actual plane. The delay was for more than 2hrs. Then an AA customer manager comes onboard and promises everyone on the plane that all our connection flights will be rescheduled automatically to the next available time by the time we reach Mardid. This was a plain outrageous lie. We were standing in an enormously long line at the AA desk at Madrid airport where basically all passengers from this flight went to, trying to get their connecting flights rearranged. Because nothing was arranged for anyone. In addition, we were told that all flights to the island were booked and they could not accommodate us on that day (we arrived around 10am in the morning). so they booked us for the next (!) day and put us in a hotel. Only the AA agent 'forgot' to tell us that there were NO SEATS and NO GUARANTEE that we were going to fly the next day! We nearly did not make it the next day because the flight was FULL! We had to wait with a little kid until everyone boarded and basically begged the staff to let us in. In addition, this flight was at 9pm which meant that we lost 2 days in Madrid, away from our main destination. In addition, our hotel in Tenerife did not cancel our missed day and we had to pay extra 500 Euros for the day we were not there. When we emailed the AA and asked them to reimburse us for the missed hotel day, cab rides that we did not intend to take, they rejected it stating that we simply had an inconvenience and nothing more than that. I am glad that we did not waste our money booking first class seats. Terrible AA agents across the board, whether in person in different countries, on email or on the phone! It is better to pay extra and book it via another airline than with AA! Do not waste your money.",Detractor

Singapore via Denpasar. Upon check-in at Perth on Saturday 7 July we were informed that we had to collect our bags in Denpasar and clear immigration - despite the fact that we were given boarding passes for our connecting flight to Singapore on the same day. When I enquired about the lounge passes we were informed that Garuda had no lounge in Denpasar. Having arrived we cleared customs but were unable to collect our bags - these had been correctly transferred and would be on the flight to Singapore with us later in the day. Somehow we missed the rep that was sent to collect us at the gate as we were transferring. Flights to Denpasar and later to Singapore were of a very high standard except for some very annoying children in the business class cabin I had to ask the parents to contain their two toddlers who were being real nuisances. Service and food on both flight were excellent and we were addressed by name at all times. Flight from Singapore to Bali on the 10th of July also excellent. However - flight from Denpasar to Perth on the 13th of July was average to poor - we had to ask for everything (wet towels drinks etc.). No menus distributed and staff rushed through the lunch service as soon as possible after take-off and then spent the rest of the 3.5 flight hiding behind the curtain. This is unacceptable for business class service. Garuda really needs to get the business class staff to step up their service on this route.

"I'm extremely unimpressed with Spirit Airlines. I understand that they're trying to be a low cost budget airline, but I still believe that it's reasonable to expect some level of competency. First, the flight really isn't that much cheaper, if it is cheaper at all. You have to pay for every piece of luggage (except for 1 backpack), plus seats if you don't want a random seat, and drinks (including water). If you're 6'4"" like me, the only seats that really fit you are the exit row seats, which run you between $20 and $40. One checked bag is $40 per trip (which was actually cheaper than bringing a carry-on for the flight I took). Plus drinks are another $2-4. Which means, if you have a lay-over and you're doing a round-trip, you'll be spending about $100 more for the flight, which makes it just as expensive as any other airline that isn't trying to be ultra-budget (at least for the flight I took). Combine the cost with the fact that they had to cancel one of my connecting flights, making me a whole day late, and top it all off with their really annoying advertising, and what you'll get is a very annoying trip. My recomendation: don't fly Spirit.",Detractor

" Venice to Ankara via Istanbul. Instead of taking off on time the fight was originally delayed (on the information table was written 10 minutes). I was satisfied with the information (it is possible to be delayed). The next information which followed invited us to go to the gate. More than 75% of passengers created the line in front of the desk and we were waiting for opening the gate. It was the first mistake, after 45 minutes the staff changed the departure time on the information desk for 10.50 a.m. Nobody knew that the game was started. The plane was delayed by more than 60 minutes. It is usually that the staff will give you any additional information about the connection flights. Unfortunately, it is not the case of Turkish Airlines . After the arrival, I run from the plane through the tunnel in the terminal and hoped to catch the flight to Ankara. The guy who was wearing the TA uniform and who was waiting at the end of the tunnel showed me the direction where I should have found the gate of for my flight. Of course, it was the wrong direction and I had to run back. After that, I had to go through the x-ray frame and I have lost another 10 minutes although I didn't leave the secured area. When I came into the main hall I sew that the gate is closed. Until this moment nobody has apologized for the inconvenience and to this day too. This horror trip was still not at the end. I tried to find the TA office and I found only the TA desk where was it possible to buy new tickets. When I started to explain my situation and the guy behind the desk recognised that I am not a new potential customer his face expression changed rapidly and his bored voice said to me that he is not responsible for information. The problem was closed for him. After a few minutes, I found the desk with the logo TA in the check-in sections. I run there to solve the problem and I tried to inform the first staff about my situation. His answer was: ""Wait a minute"".. I didn't want to wait and I said to him, that his company is responsible for the situation and I expect more empathy and full service for customers. No answer, only disgusted reaction visible in his mimic and he showed me with the finger another TA worker sitting next to him. This person let explain to him my situation again and he printed a new boarding pass for the flight at 6.00 p.m. I checked the departure on the screen and by my next flight was additional information that it is delayed 40 minutes before the departure. I asked the guy again whether it is mean serious and my second question was why it is not possible to get the ticket for the flight at 5.00 p.m.? The answer was given with the highest arrogance in his voice.""The flight is full!"".

"Returning home after a long holiday in the US, flying Delta Air Lines, Orlando to Amsterdam via Detroit. Departure from Orlando was delayed due to airport closure for lightning, the aircraft was an old Boeing 757-200 and age was clearly showing. There was no meal service even in first class, but the service was good, the Delta Airlines ground staff receiving the flight at Detroit were not interested in helping us with the connecting flight to Amsterdam - until one official at a different gate helped out. Detroit to Amsterdam flight was a newly refitted Boeing 767-400 with nice business class beds but the monitor screen was small and could not compare with competing airlines. I selected the vegetarian option on the food which was a cannelloni with goat cheese on a bed of spinach, a very bland and uncooked dish, the bottom half of the pasta was dry and hard there was a sprinkle of marinara sauce - not even enough to taste let alone to moisturize the pasta. Breakfast was a cereal which was OK. IFE selection was better than average on the international sector. Both sectors had a very good WIFI connection.",Passive
Flew Colombo-Istanbul via Male to Antalya three weeks ago and got back last Monday. All flights were delayed except for the last leg on return flight from Istanbul to Colombo via Male where I really would have prayed for a delay as my connecting flight got 1.30 hrs delayed from Antalya! Good in-flight service and food etc. Flight delays are so common that you spend an addition of 5-6 hrs on the way than originally scheduled! Plus mad rushing from Domestic to International Terminal in Istanbul with only about 20 minutes for the connecting flight. One of my bags came on the flight. Other came one day. Can't recommend this airline unless you can stomach constant delays!,Detractor

"  I've been flying with Cathay for 26 years. My family and I are all Marco Polo members ranging from green to gold. Today I waited 9.5 hours at the airport for my flight from Sydney to Hong Kong (CX110, now CX162), and now I'm told it'll be another 30 mins wait. I understand that HK is experiencing bad weather and I was told the plane had a mechanical problem but there has been problems with the way they dealt with this issue. They never made an announcement about the cancelled flight until well after the anticipated boarding time. When we approached the front desk we were told that the flight is cancelled and we were transferred to a later flight. Staff said if they made an announcement then it would create a commotion. It makes no logical sense. I said lots of people are probably still waiting for the announcement. Fast forward to the plane ride: the most shoddy plane ride ever. I've flown with many airlines - even down to tiny airlines like Air Timor. This has got to be the worst plane I've flown. The backs of our seats could not be controlled and went up and down just by leaning on it. We were shifted to the back for take off and the TV did not work (I have to say the inflight manager was nice about it). The cold water button in the bathroom didn't work. I saw staff roll their eyes after talking to passengers. As I was put in the last seat on the plane on this service, I also heard all the gossip about passengers from the staff at the back. I have booked 3 more flights with Cathay in the coming 2 weeks and I'm really dreading it.",Detractor

Especially it has the entire season of TV series. Other airlines only have several episodes. MEL-HKG had supper and breakfast the food was delicious. Three choices for the main course: fish fillet beef sirloin with rice and vegetarian penne. Breakfast had two options they are seafood congee and frittata with bacon. Choices ran out as I was in the rear row so I can only choose frittata. But the cabin crew keep apologised many times they were very good.,Promoter
" Shanghai to Dammam via Abu Dhabi. I have been flying Etihad for move than 5 years now (reaching gold and platinum status) and the service have been going down hill quick. I have three upgrades which I paid for and yet the system does not recognize this and does not credit me any miles (zero miles). I been calling Etihad and emailing them since January and even until today (end of March) there has been no resolution, just the run around and telling me to wait. Why does it take so long to credit miles to an account, the flight is already in my account but displaying zero miles. Poor service and poor management within Etihad. The flight attendants are rude and poorly managed. On one particular flight there was three Eastern European flight attendants who were best friends and spent most of their time in the galley chatting.

" Toronto to Puerto Vallarta. First time on Air Canada rouge, and based on the reviews was expecting the worst when in reality it was about on par with Air Canada. Same menu, same service. although the attendants seemed more like servers at a Kelseys rather than professional flight crew. Had my own iPad and did find a couple of movies to watch. The flight departed and arrived on time as did my luggage so no complaints there either. I missed the moving map and there was no communication from the flight deck until the descent. The seats really weren't an issue until the person in front reclined theirs, I'm only 5""6 and their seat was jammed against my knees. The person refused to straighten the seat back so I could get out to use the washroom. had to squeeze out over the armrest. On my return flight I booked the preferred seat at the wing exit and was much more comfortable. Similar experience, departed and arrived on time, same food choices as on AC and no updated from the flight deck.",Passive
  Friday flight Stansted to Dublin. Given a ten minute delay notice but despite that loaded on quickly and departed on time. No fuss with clients and baggage all very slick. Flight passed quickly and landed half an hour early. Very efficient. No problem with people and their seats.

Norwegian just lost another 3 customers. We were pleased when they launched their London Gatwick to Rome service as we go to Rome quite frequently. Christmas 2013 they were superb. Amidst considerable chaos at Gatwick they left pretty much on time and got us there fine. However since then they managed to give my wife a 6 hour delay (Rome to London Gatwick) at Easter 2014 turning a late night flight into an early morning flight. Last night - Dec 28th 2014 - my daughter and I were on the 21.55 from Rome to Gatwick which suffered a 4 hour delay and I finally got to bed at 6.30am. They were also an hour late on the outbound flight. My advice would be to avoid. The late evening slot they have at Rome means a delay does turn into a real inconvenience particularly if you are supposed to go to work next day. Communication from their customer service staff almost non existent. Got the feeling they were scared of us and that these delays were pretty common. Also nothing to do with Norwegian but Rome Fiumicino airport is pretty awful for being stuck at late at night. Everything shut no food or drink and horrible metal chairs with fixed metal armrests so you can't lay out on even though there was plenty of space. People started laying on the floor. Anyway on 6 flights we have had a 1 hour a 4 hour and a 6 hour delay so I'm not interested any more fortunately London to Rome I have many options.,Detractor
" London Heathrow to Perth via Hong Kong. You learn a lot about a business when things go wrong. I've learned today that CP struggle greatly to deal with difficulties. My premium economy flight was originally scheduled for 17:15, to Perth via Hong Kong, but was subject to repeated delays until my connection was under threat. The people in the lengthy queue at the desk informed me the flight was unlikely to leave and that staff were rebooking people to other flights, even other airlines. I waited for more than two hours in the queue, eventually to be told that there were two options available . I could take the first leg in the 5 hour delayed original flight, with no onward connection available until 24 hours after the original, resulting in a full day delay. My other option was to fly another airline, to Sydney via Singapore, with a lengthy wait there until a connection to Perth, the latter leg in economy and around 14 hours delay. No upgrades were offered, despite those delays and the inconvenience. I asked about being upgraded and was very reluctantly offered business class on the first leg only, on the first option. That, apparently, is the very best they could do for me. During the conversation I was invited to explore other routes and options myself online if I thought I could do better, told that I should appreciate that they hadn't deliberately planned this disruption and informed that they were dealing with lots of people in the same situation - as though I was somehow not appreciating fully their problems and being rather selfish in the circumstances. I won't be flying with them again after this trip And I'll be spreading the word around our Australia-based business - not because they had a problem with my flight but because their response to it was haphazard and unsatisfactory.",Detractor
"As a regular customer of Turkish Airlines I now have to write a review of the horrible experience we had flying back from Addis Abeba om Jan 2nd (plus the delay of our luggage on the way there on Dec 20th). It started on arrival in Addis on Dec 20th, none of our 5 bags had made it, it turned out that due to a change of plane there was not enough space in the hold and they had left most of them behind in Istanbul. Had to go back to the aiport the next day to get the bags, fortunately they were all there. Then on the way back our flight to Istanbul had a delay of more than 3 hours. We all boarded but then had to sit on the tarmac for 1.5 hours because they had to unload half of the luggage and told us it would arrive later. Of course we missed the connection in Istanbul and were greeted with total chaos due to the fact that extremely light snow had fallen. We had to queue for 4 hours together with hundreds of other people, no water, no food, many very angry people and no help whatsoever from any Turkish Airlines staff. To make a long story short: only because I insisted on getting on a flight that day were we lucky enough to be put on a flight to Amsterdam (not Brussels) which departed in total chaos as well. Many people were stranded for more than one night. We arrived in Amsterdam with 14 hours delay and no luggage. This was delivered to us after 5 days. Service on board this time was a lot less as well, IFE was not working or was not there at all, food was not as tasty and it was a very old plane on the leg to and from Addis. Next time I fly to Addis I will use another airline.",Detractor
Booked our trip from the Bahamas to Canada on May 15th from Air Canada. After hearing about Rouge I wondered and checked the reservation. It was Air Canada Rouge where the seats have been taken out replaced with cheaper shorter seats with no inflight entertainment or even a plug and they have added 2 rows. Not wanting to endure that flight with nothing to do I loaded the laptop with stuff to watch. We boarded and found out the man in the window seat had taken my aisle seat. After we fixed that I found out why. He said he had been flying Air Canada for 22 years and had never had that little leg room. After we were in the air I pulled out the laptop case from under my feet and found out I did not have enough room to open it. I slid it into the aisle to open was told not to do that but got the laptop out. I pulled out my tray put the laptop on it opened the laptop to find out there wasn't enough room to open the screen high enough to view it. I am a thin woman so I pulled the tray into my chest and the laptop closer too. That worked and I watched a movie the whole flight. Every time somebody went down the aisle they hit my seat which jabbed the laptop into my chest a bit more. I can no longer fly the real Air Canada to the Bahamas WestJet flies there too and they have normal legroom and inflight entertainment.,Detractor

Along with several others from my flight we made our complaint at Heathrow lost baggage desk. I was told my baggage would be delivered within 24 hours. It did arrive, but 48 hours later. On the flight, food was average at best, beer was lukewarm, inflight entertainment was poor with controls set into the armrest meaning movies would accidentally be fast forwarded/stopped etc - very annoying. FA's were unsmiling/unfriendly but professional. Flight was too cold, with thin, ineffective blankets provided.

However this leg wasn't the big issue. New Delhi to Singapore was the big issue.

When I questioned him why this was so, he said ""Yes you have paid to choose that seat, but it doesn't mean it's confirmed."". When I argued further with him on this, he resorted to saying ""It's not my fault!"". On the plane, the tray table was horribly stained with curry. Had to ask the flight attendants countless times for help until I got a few napkins from them and had to clean it up myself. The flight attendant was irritated with me and started treating me rudely for the rest of the flight. Food was terrible as well. I am not picky with airlines, as long as they are decent. I have flown many different airlines from all six continents. However, Air India the one airline that is far from any acceptable standards and truly does not deserve the title of being a Star Alliance member.

"Alicante to London Gatwick via Madrid with Air Europa. Possibly the worst experience on ground and inflight I've ever experienced. Flight from Alicante to Madrid was okay, though the planes are very dated for domestic flight and operated by Swift Air (ATR). After arrival in MAD discovered the flight was delayed by 1 hour. However, boarding was supposed to start 15:20, but no updates from ground staff when we were waiting until 16:00. At this point I approached ground staff to ask when to expect to depart. They flogged passengers and myself off with the flight was delayed arriving and now cleaners we late. However that plane had been sitting there on the tarmac since before original departure at 15:00. Ground staf told me to look at the screen which then the time then changed to 16:30. When mentioning what will happen as I will it looks like I will not make my next flight which had originally 2.5 hours between the ground staff just said ""if it ain't Air Europa or partners we dont care"". Ive never expereinced such poor attitude and rudeness in all my flying years. Eventually we boarded at 17:10 when it was stated they now have cabin crew available leaving 2.5 hours late. In air, the cabin crew almost ignored passengers and not even offered any drink during meal service which was not exectly of the best quality. I chose to to pay for anything but would be nice to be asked if you want any drink. Overall experience with this airline is appalling. Never flying this airline again.",Detractor

No airline or airport employees to be found. Poorly labeled gates in areas that are under construction. Aggressive, angry passengers lashing out at each other. Everything that could be bad about boarding practices happened here. Contrast that to the orderly, calm boarding at both BWI and Gatwick and it is clear the home base of this airline has a problem. Very specific, probably won't happen to you complaints - another passenger's bag fell on my head, but according to Wow this is somehow my fault, for sitting quietly in my assigned seat and magically willing a bag to fall on me, not the fault of their free-for-all boarding practices.

When we arrived at the airport the flight was delayed and the Premium Package we paid for was really nothing different then Economy service.

We could take a refund or wait until Tuesday when they could rebook us. So we took our refund booked with another airline and made it out of Chicago. We will never again fly Spirit.

Flew on 2/27/14 from LGA to MIA on a US airways code share flight. Aircraft was newish Boeing 737 800. Seats were comfortable with adjustable headrest with plenty of space between my knees and seat in front. They were comparable to United's economy plus seats. Service was friendly and professional. The aircraft had wifi which could be purchased and the bandwidth was more than adequate for getting email and work done. All safety announcements and instructions seem to be pre recorded in a voice with a a neutral calm tone. As is the case in most US domestic they only have beverage service but they give you the whole along with glass as oppose to UA where they only fill the ice filled plastic cup. Inflight entertainment consisted of overhead monitors with requirement to purchase headphones however wifi availability made up for this.,Promoter

"  Flight from Dallas to Seoul Incheon was atrocious. After arriving from Amarillo I found out that my flight to Seoul would be delayed 2 hours, meaning that I would miss my last connection flight to Jakarta. When asking the ground service about why the delay, they just rudely told me, ""Maintenance. That's all I know."" They also gave off a tone that seemed as if they hated their job. On top of this, during the actual flight that the delay was only for getting another plane ready. The old cabin sure added to the experience. The IFE was messed up, so Economy class was stuck watching Disney channel shows on repeat for the 13 hour flight. I also recall a cockroach crawling into my seat, but I wasn't surprised, so I didn't do anything about it.

Travelled back from Cape Town on 28th February 2015. Booked seats beforehand to make sure that we had front row seats only to get on the plane and discover contrary to what the webview had displayed we were bang smack in the middle of a row of seat! Complained to BA and told that the maps you can see on ba.com are representative of the seats on board flights and that they cannot guarantee your seat will be exactly as shown on our website as the configuration can vary depending on the aircraft you're travelling on. What a total rip off! The seats were extremely cramped our inflight entertainment system keep failing. Once the food had been dished out and tidied away the flight attended disappeared completely and absolutely no water or drinks were offered until we were about two hours from landing! BA need to get their act together and invest in better aircraft's. Clapped out 747s - even first class looked shoddy!,Detractor

I requested to meet any supervisor or manager from Emirates, but they said no body available and it is your mistake, you have to check that wheelchair service include in case Emirates missed it. I called customer service (supervisor) for 45 min to complain and at the end he said ""please send your complaint via email, nothing we can do for you right now"".

" Washington to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I decided to go with them because they were cheaper. After my first flight with them, I should've paid more for world class service from Emirates or Qatar. The staff at the check in were unfriendly, the seat recline broke which forced me to push my seat with my back the whole 12 hour flight. This gave me back pain days after. I couldn't find a flight attendant to notify about the seat. Its not just their staff that arent attentive, its their whole policy towards their less opulent customers. It is really difficult to get in contact with their customer service. To ""compensate customers"" for a bad flight they give something called travel credits which are worthless to you unless you want to buy another flight or buy overpriced seat selections. I do not recommend flying with them until they see the importance of all their customers and improve their product and policy.",Detractor

"  First, the boarding gate is gate 1 in Hong Kong, which is very close to the exit of the customs. The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK, Asia and western movies, TV programmes and music. And touch screen monitor is responsive. Unlike the one fitted on Hong Kong airline where you have to touch it ten times before the screen senses your response.",Promoter

I was told there would be a $200 up charge for that flight because it was in a different class than I had originally booked. I do not feel a customer should be charged when their flight was cancelled and there are available seats on the next flight. I ended up having to switch airlines and airports which is now causing even more delays. I also purchased a non-stop flight and am now going to have a layover.

"  Bangkok to Cancun via Houston. Narita to Houston return I paid extra for a Economy premium seats. In flight service was extremely poor, flight attendants on both flights were unfriendly, spoke in rude tones. None of them ever smiled or expressed a word of greeting. Snacks were thrown on the lap of passenger who was next to me since he was sleeping. Quality of food was extremely poor, no presentation, servings were small. Bun/sandwich served for snack was dry and hardly edible. There was absolutely no value for additional money I paid for Economy premium seat. It was uncomfortable seat, with hardly any difference of leg space in the ordinary Economy class. There was nothing pleasant about the in flight service of 12- 13 hour flights both ways.

" Shanghai to Milan. I just came back from a 2 week trip across China and I found myself flying with Air China multiple times over that span of time. I was skeptical about this airline in the first place, but I had no choice since the flights were already included in the travel packet. What can I say, it lived up to my lowest expectations, and the worst were international routes, especially the one from Milan to Beijing. We flew on an A330 but the aircraft looked as old as the hills and was impossibly noisy, so much so that I had serious trouble following the movies I was watching. Corridors are narrow and the space between seats is very limited and their entertainment offer is mostly made of Chinese movies. On top of that, my monitor was completely dead and there was no way to bring it back to life. I pointed it out to the flight attendants many times and they kept coming and going first trying to fix it themselves and then saying they'd try to reset the whole system, but to no avail. Luckily there was a spare seat in the row in front of me so I moved there, only to find out that the guy who had been previously sitting there had moved away himself because that monitor wasn't working properly either. As it turned out, it was insanely slow and some buttons on the remote weren't working (yeah there were remotes if you're wondering, the ones you pull out of the seat and then back in), but hey that was as good as it went! The service was virtually non existent - the crew only stopped by twice for meals and that was it. If you wanted water you had to look for them yourself and ask for it and they would come and pour you a glass of water. As for the food, I didn't touch anything because it was terrible. Overall it made for a very uncomfortable flight. A guy sitting next to me told me he had flown with Air China in the past for work, but he didn't recall it to be that bad and that the aircraft looked the same as the one he had flew in 10 years ago. This said, it should hardly be surprising that I was dreading the idea of having to take internal flights as I was expecting those aircrafts to be even older. I was pleasantly surprised instead since their internal routes turned out to be much better. The aircrafts were just regular airbuses and they were quiet enough. Oh one more thing, the pilots' English is barely understandable, I'm no native speaker but I'm fluent in English so I don't have any trouble with listening, but these pilots are the worst! Flight attendants are slightly better, but don't venture beyond basic stuff or else you'll lose them. In summary, the only plus is that it's is way cheaper than any other airline and offers highly competitive fares, however if you have a choice pick another airline at least for your long-haul flight! With hindsight, I would probably had paid a little bit more and bought the flight with Etihad or Lufthansa, even with a layover.",Passive

Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one.

Other things they told us were ""perks"": check in luggage ($25 extra each), overhead storage (not allowed), 1 carry on or personal item only (to be stored under the seat only), and the seat itself! Yes she actually said the seat is a pen and would be extra! After all that they wouldn't even seat me with my wife. We were close - 15 rows away! Currently waiting to board in 2 hours.

On the way back was worse I was spilled again from a child in front and two other passengers in the same row left because of it.

I paid $43 US for my checked luggage to and from and on the way back it was slightly over 40lbs so they charged another $30. The ticket agents were incredibly rude and nasty. My carry on was the exact measurement except the wheels were about an inch so they charged another $65. Even charged for water.

"Our Air Canada rouge flight from Toronto to Sarasota was to leave at 4pm on January 12. When we boarded the first plane we were told shortly after boarding, that the Sarasota airport was not able to handle the plane's equipment, but not to worry, there was another plane waiting for us at another gate. We all got off, and went to another gate / plane. At that time we were told the second plane was ""off line"" for maintenance issues. We would have to wait for a third plane to take us, but this plane was in Jamaica, and was running one hour late (despite Air Canada have dozens of aircraft sitting in Toronto). Around 9pm we boarded an A319, which was very clean. The seats are most uncomfortable. I am 5 11"" and barely fit into the seats. If the passenger in front of you reclines their seat, you are doomed to hours of discomfort. When you buy tickets on Air Canada rouge, you still pay the regular Air Canada price, so you pay for a normal seat, but get a budget airline. There is no entertainment system (eg movies). The flight staff crew are young, and seem discouraged by passenger comments on the poor quality of the aircraft. Summary, full price tickets, late and delayed flights on older aircraft, very uncomfortable seating. If you can avoid flying Rouge, you will be better off for it.",Detractor

"  This was the worst flight I ever took and I fly a lot. During the 9h between Los Angeles and Reykjavik, WOW air staff never turned off the light even though it was a night flight. Seats were not only uncomfortable but it was also impossible to expand them at all. I asked for a glass of water after 6h of flight, and they told me I have to pay for the bottle. And they were quite rude. I felt sorry for the staff, because keeping people happy with such a bad plane and awful policies must really be a challenge. I can somehow understand the policy ""0 water"" when it's a short flight. But on a 9h flight, it's dangerous not to make sure the passengers stay hydrated, and it's completely immoral not to give them even a glass of water. I paid 1,000$ for the trip (back and forth), and I have never experienced such poor quality in a flight. I am very disappointed with this company. I am telling everyone I know not to fly with them, and I will surely never book another flight on this airline ever again.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Paris. Check-in was very quick at a dedicated area in Hong Kong Airport. There were two porters that took the bags and a very nice and smiley agent completing the check in process within 1 minute. As I arrived slightly late at the airport, she walked me to the entrance of security and asked a more junior colleague to take me through security. The staff that accompanied me was not that necessary as we did not have to jump any queue. Hong Kong Airport must have the world's most efficient security screening and although there were quite a lot of people, the security and immigration process took less than 10 minutes. Did not have time to visit the lounge and once on board, the cabin crew asked me where my seat was and she immediately addressed me by my name. A very comfortable pyjamas, slippers, elaborate AESOP amenities kit were given out. Amuse bouche and champagne was served before take off. A restaurant style menu board was given as the senior crew member introduced himself followed by the junior crew refilling the champagne. Once off, they came round to take order for the late night supper which consisted of caviar, salmon, an extensive choice of Western and Chinese food. I was not hungry and ordered only a Chinese soup which was hot and very flavourful. I must have looked very tired and the crew suggested me to go get changed and they would set up the bed for me. When I returned, my seat turned into a very comfortable and wide bed. The crew proposed a cup of camomile tea which I gladly accepted. I slept for a good 10 hours and when I woke up, other passengers were already having their breakfast. I was hungry and opted to have the full breakfast of fruit, toasts, cereal and dim sum - quality comparable to many restaurants in Hong Kong. I asked the crew if I could have more toasts as I was still hungry, they proposed some scramble eggs or a bowl of wonton noodles for me. At the end, I had a hard boiled egg in a bowl of delicious wonton noodles. The cabin crew on this flight were classy but friendly and approachable at the same time, they give out the feeling that they were genuinely happy to have you travelling with them.

The space between the seatback in front and your face is inches. It's really claustrophobic. The food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice. So for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food. The short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water. The M&S menu is expensive and offers limited choices. Meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price. The planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy. The cabin crew on the BOS to LHR and LHR to EDI were good. There was one member in the LHR to BOS who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job.

Plane was far too hot on the way back and despite lots of passenger requests for them to turn the air-con on nothing seemed to change and it was a long 6hrs. Have flown long haul with Virgin and Cathay Pacific and these were much better on all fronts would only consider BA in the future if it was the only option available or half the price of the other carriers!,Passive
" Florence to Gatwick. Outward flight left on time luggage arrived cabin crew great so good. Return flight Vueling lived up to their reputation - boarded left sitting there for over an hour after expected departure time announcement. Cabin crew were lovely no complaints. 1 loo blocked so not operational, big queues but not really a drama. The drama when we arrived immediately told at Gatwick no checked bags were loaded because it was too windy & there was a weight issue. I'm lucky after filling in form, global baggage solutions delivered my case today 48 hrs late - my sister who lives in Scotland fingers crossed hers will be delivered too. Dont lie Vueling, your clients are not idiots & we dont appreciate being treated as such, just be honest.",Detractor
"  Redmond to Reno via Portland. I've had a lot of good experiences with AlaskaAir, but this trip was not a good one. Two hours before the flight, I get an e-mail saying ""Sorry, your flight has been canceled."" However, the e-mail, ios app, and online all showed the same exact itinerary. It wasn't until I arrived at Portland did everything update to show that my PDX-RNO flight was completely canceled. I was auto-booked for a flight the next day. Not only is that terrible, but the lady at the counter was able to fit me into the last seat on a flight that afternoon, which means the auto-booking system isn't helpful. I had to sit in Portland twiddling my thumbs for 8 hours, and it was awful. Here's the redeeming qualities of Alaska Airlines, the rep gave me some vouchers for food and snacks, and discount codes for my next booking. Not a worthy trade to me, but at least they were apologetic and tried to remedy the situation as best they could. Like I said, this was my only bad experience with Alaska so I won't swear them off for that. Except for the flight attendant that skipped over me for a drink. That was annoying.",Promoter

Don't believe it! When United changed the credit card number because that card was apparently compromised, United refused to allow one free checked bag, because the credit card we had at the airport did not match the card used to purchase the tickets (which had since been cancelled).

The captain informed us the reason for the delay but we still arrived at our destination on time. Cabin crew were efficient, courteous and helpful. We had ample room in economy, and whilst my 6'4"" husband was a little squashed, he did not assume the foetal position. We weren't interested in food or inflight entertainment for such a short trip. My only negative feedback was the PA system. We could hear the captain quite well but announcements by cabin crew were barely audible (a potential safety issue). I'm also astounded by the amount of excessive/large baggage some passengers bring on board (obviously to avoid checked baggage charges). Otherwise, a very pleasant flight.",Promoter
LHR-BKK. They are reluctant to offer alcohol and only offer water orange juice or apple juice in small quantities. I asked for a can of cola - flight attendant opened a can poured less than half of it into a glass put the can on her trolley and walked off. Food portions are small. Forget about requesting a seat when you book. That counts for nothing because at the end of the day check-in staff do not care about a specific seat request.

I had no idea what Air Canada 'Rouge' was until I experienced it on a trip from Toronto to Tampa on January 13 2015. Everything you read in the unflattering reviews is true. However to add insult to injury we had a full flight with no water in either of the washrooms! There was what appeared to be a well-worn sign in the washrooms apologizing for the lack of water and a supply of little individual towelettes to wipe your hands afterwards. On the trip back when the stewardess asked if I wanted a drink I asked first whether there was water in the washroom this time before deciding whether or not to drink anything. I will never travel Air Canada Rouge again. I will fly another airline for my next trip to Florida in a few months time just to avoid the inconvenience of no leg room (and I'm barely 5 foot tall) discomfort of thinly padded seats inability to get in and out of any seats but the aisle nothing to ease boredom - not even a used newspaper from a previous flight.

Economy round-trip from SIN-ARN via Bangkok. Found their service to be patchy: it was great on TG 410 (SIN-BKK) and TG 403 (BKK-SIN) acceptable on TG 961 (ARN-BKK) and lukewarm on TG 960 (BKK-ARN). I didn't like that they didn't have kid-sized headphones for IFE - my tiny 5-year old held hers up to her ears for the whole journey. On the ARN-BKK and BKK-SIN legs there was not much difference between my special meal and the kids' meals. They also did not give the kids any 'goody bags' except for the BKK-SIN leg where they presented my kids with lunchboxes filled with snacks. FAs didn't do their rounds much during the night portion of the BKK-ARN leg they did it more frequently during the ARN-BKK leg though they ran out of the snacks as many passengers were peckish during the night (between dinner and breakfast service).

Awful experience and even worse customer service. Had a flight from Orlando delayed due to weather in Ft. Lauderdale and final destination in Medellin Colombia. I was told no planes were coming or leaving so we would not miss our connecting flight. We finally took off and landed only to hear from a very rude gate agent that the plane took off early and left me and 20+ other passengers stranded. Mind you they give us 5 minutes from the time our plane landed to the time when we have to be at the gate to board the connecting flight. I was given a discount coupon for a room which was useless since all the rooms were booked. I had to pay 180 dollars for an awful room at a red carpet inn. Also they change gates and departing times while you are at 36000 feet! Save yourself the hassle and unreasonable rude individuals and just pay a little more.,Detractor

I look at the seat map and there were 76 vacant seats with 32 possible adjacent seating combinations. I have never heard of a company that brings out a product and then makes sure you hate it. We asked to sit together at the airport and were told : 100â‚¬ and that we should have paid the $12 at home or the $240 to have an ""upgraded"" fare.

Tonight I went to the airport to board my flight from SFO to Cancun. I got there in plenty of time and had 2 bags to check. Their website clearly states that the first bag is free and the second bag is 50 dollars. When I got to the ticket counter the agent told me that the flight was fully booked and they were only accepting passengers with one piece of luggage. They were not accepting a second bag even if you wanted to pay. I asked them what I could do and they said I could board the flight but only if I left one bag behind. Forcing passengers with more than one luggage to give up their seats on an overbooked flight so they could solve their over booked flight without any compensation. If you ever take Aeromexico don't assume you can just pay for an extra bag. You can take 2 bags but you may have to either leave one behind or get moved to another flight.

" I purchased tickets Mar. 17 which had us flying out of PDX and arriving in Cozumel the same day. In Sept. 17, I received an email that AA changed our reservations. It seemed fine since it was a shorter travel time than the original tickets. The a.m. of the flight we arrived to check in at PDX, and during the self-check in, we got a priority slip. We took it to the ticket counter and learned that when AA changed our flights, they did not allow their own â€œmandatoryâ€ 50 minutes for the connection flight. As such, they refused to allow us to catch our connection from DFW to CZM. Keep in mind that this was their mandatory layover time and they made the change that didn't conform to it! AA was unable to locate a flight that would get us into Cozumel the same day, so we were forced to incur an overnight layover at DFW. To add insult to injury, each leg of each flight they were challenged to allow me and my fiancÃ© sit together. We would have to pay at the ticket gate to move seats. Um, we purchased our tickets at the same time, is it too far of a stretch to consider we might want to sit together! So, for four flights we had to take extra time to â€œsweet talkâ€ the gate agent into letting us sit together. Unbelievable! Due to the layover resulting from AA's error, we were forced to incur additional hotel and meal costs, spend time rearranging transfers, contacting the hotel, etc., lost an entire day of vacation time/pay, lost our all-inclusive charges and hotel charge from the hotel in Cozumel, stressed out having to pick up the pieces because of AA's mistake, and now I'm getting the pleasure of fighting with AA since they are only offering is a $250 flight voucher for each of us. That doesn't come close to compensating for the time, money, and trouble they caused. And actually, at this point, I wish I were fighting with them. They've gone incommunicado. Won't call when they say they will, won't return calls. and, who would want vouchers from this joke of an airline? The only silver lining was the accommodating flight attendants. Otherwise, this company ought to be ashamed of themselves. Based on my research, this isn't a one off.",Detractor
Singapore to Perth in a Qantas 737 aircraft better suited for shorter flights not a 5 over hours flight. Seating was cramped and felt claustrophobic after a few hours. Service was slow took them 2 hours before dinner was served. The crew seemed to take their time and worked slowly. Not much engagement with the passengers. Small main meal then a cheese cracker service then a kit kat chocolate service (they seem to have split up the usual meal tray items and served them separately to give the impression you are getting 'a lot' to eat I suppose).

Called customer services while on my way, and after 15min of wait I was told they couldn't do anything about it, but gave me the number of the airport. It was incorrect. At Terminal 5 I asked the attendant for help given the rush. He was quite rude and said I had to join the queue unless I was flying business. At the gate, we had a late boarding because 'the computer wasn't working'. I was flying premium economy and let me say, on this flight (BA0199) it is like the economy class of several other airlines. Plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment. My headrest was hanging down the seat, the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it wouldn't stay in position. The flight attendant (who I never saw smiling for the entire flight) said he had reported it on the way in. I asked to change my seat. In my new seat the headphone audio had regular loud cracks and pops (it wasn't the headphones, I tried mine too). The entertainment system was poor. It started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing, plus the 'noise cancelling' headphones are NOT noise cancelling - try pulling the jack out and it doesn't make a difference.

"  Brisbane to Edinburgh via Abu Dhabi. The first sector Brisbane to Abu Dhabi was significantly better than the connecting flight to Edinburgh, however both were still fine. Check in was reasonable except our seats weren't together and when I asked for a seat map we still ended up being apart. However the crew were happy to help on board. The Air NZ lounge is OK while not the same standard as Etihad lounges but was pleasant enough. The 787 cabin is much nicer that the others in the Etihad fleet that I have travelled on apart from the bed is harder that the older A330. In every other aspect the 787 is a superior product and the high quality of the experience really ramped up once onboard with a wonderful and obliging crew. The food on the first 787 sector was superb, the beef fillet was perfect and the meal service top notch. Wine on both flights were exceptional. The second flight had a less warm and competent crew and the food for the main meal was overcooked and half of it not edible. It was still a pretty comfortable flight overall with the majority of time spent sleeping. Bags were off really quickly and with the free chauffeur waiting we were at our hotel less than an hour after the plane touched down.

I recently took Air New Zealand to Sydney as part of a ticket with connections to a Vietnam Airlines Flight. Arrived early at Auckland Airport checked in with a customer service staff as their cost cutting exercise with no check in counters means that the check in kiosk does not work for when taking connecting flights and having to check your bags through. Arrived early at the gate ready to board at 6.15 am only to board 10 minutes prior to departure meaning we departed late as they have just one staff in charge of the boarding process. When on board felt like a sardine especially with the larger man in front of me with the seat bending back badly. Aircraft certainly ageing and seat very hard and uncomfortable. Food and drink okay but very basic. Entertainment outdated as well was watching something had already seen before.

" Flight to London cancelled after I boarded the plane. Poor communication from the airline. When they reach high call volumes, their customer service line actually shuts down. They put me up in a poor quality hotel, and told me to come back the next day and check in at the info desk. When I did so, I was told I had to buy another flight because I missed my flight. That was not only untrue (I boarded the plane and they scanned my boarding pass) but impossible (the plane never left!). After escalating the issue, I was rebooked for later that evening. I lost a day of my vacation, paid for a hotel I couldn't stay at (non-refundable) and had to change my connecting flight (which cost me about $200). My return flight was delayed 6 hours. When we landed, the pilot decided to sit on the runway for 2 hours because it was raining and windy. That only got worse. I was supposed to have a stopover in Iceland that night and spent $145 to visit the Blue Lagoon. I was unable to go due to the delays, so I ate that expense, and my stopover consisted of sleeping in a hotel and flying out the next day. After returning home, I called their customer service and they are still ""unavailable due to high call volumes"". I will never use this airline again, and would not recommend using them if you have a connecting flight, or being tempted by the stopover offers. It's not worth it! Fly with a different airline.

  London to Delhi return with Air India. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this flight was. The Boeing 787 is a very nice plane and cabin crew that were looking after the passengers in my area were a credit to Air India. The food was disappointing though and the price was fairly high. But I would consider travelling with Air India again if the planes are new like this and cabin crew are of this standard. The ground services in Delhi needs to be better organised - for example the check in desks were dealing with more than one flight at a time and this was causing delays. Overall better than expected but a long way to go before Air India can be considered an airline of choice.,Passive
"I have just flown my outward leg of a short break to Hong Kong and have mixed feelings about the journey. I should have left Manchester at 7.50am but the flight was apparently oversold so got bumped to a later flight which was actually listed as the 5.50am earlier flight that was delayed due to a technical problem. Given how empty this later actually flight was, I think it was more the case of me being bumped because I had no status with the airline and KLM simply moved all their Gold and Silver members to my flight. I was supposed to be connecting to a Xiamen Airlines flight (AMS-XMN then XMN-HKG) in AMS but after pointing out that I might make the connection but my baggage definitely wouldn't, the check-in staff agreed and rerouted me. The only way I could get to Hong Kong was to be rebooked onto KLM's direct flight leaving AMS at 5.45pm so had nearly 6 hours layover in Schipol airport. However I was offered 120 euros as compensation so wasn't too depressed and it meant not having to go through the nonsense of immigration at Xiamen despite being a transit passenger. The first leg of the journey (MAN-AMS) left after 9.30am and was not helped by whoever's decision it was to refuel it the plane only once all the passengers were on-board the aircraft. I ask you, this aircraft had been sat empty for at least previous 3 hours! The flight itself was comfortable with decent seat width/pitch plus crew came around with a snack and a drink. Once at AMS, I found the KLM desk and managed to bag an exit row for the 11 hour flight and was delighted until I discovered that the plane (B747-400) had no in-seat USB power in economy unlike the new Xiamen Airlines B787 Dreamliner (which is partly why I booked with Xiamen Airlines in the first place). Boarding was smooth but I was surprised how tight in width the seats were. However once into the flight, I could really understand why many airlines are now ditching the 747 in favour of more modern planes like the the 787 or the A380. However this KLM flight did have one redeeming feature that was the staff who worked hard the entire flight. The toilets which I was sat close to were cleaned around 4-5 times and crew offered drinks throughout the flight. The food offerings were beef or pasta but by the time they reached me, the pasta had run out and I thought I might be missing out but was brought along a vegetarian Indian style meal which was rather good. As we were descending into Hong Kong, I discovered my seat was broken and could not return to the upright position. One of the crew came around and fixed it but a few minutes later, I could feel it had gone again when I leant back. Given we were so close to landing, I just leant forward instead and kept quiet. The best thing about the whole flight is that I only paid Â£340 including credit card charge booking fees so happy that I am now in Hong Kong and enjoying my break.",Passive
" Dubai to Bucharest. I have never been so angry and disappointed with an airline. This is unacceptable and ridiculous really to the point of being offensive. Our plane had a â€˜technical issue' or flight was programmed to leave at 10:30 am. After 3 hours delayed they sent us back to the terminal. They told us to wait until 3:30 pm. We boarded again, the same plane. And guess what! â€˜technical issue'. Completely ridiculous. Now we are getting back to the airport again",Detractor
" Flew Mumbai to Bhubaneswar. I was very surprised by the service, the whole Air India team was welcoming. There were more flight attendants than I see usually with other airlines. Each one was taking care of every customer. Most of the luggage lifting and its arrangement was done by them (unlike other airlines). Special care was taken of kids and elderly people. The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today. The ticket rates are competitive and sometimes cheaper than others.",Promoter

On the first meal service our first choice of meal was not available they made a note and when they came back through with the second meal service they ensured that we got to tell them our choice before they went through the rest of the cabin. The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on. Food was excellent with great choices. Inflight entertainment is really the best I have experienced especially the aircraft that had the latest version of the ICE system loaded.

We scheduled a flight from Dayton OH. to Boston with a connection going to Boston in Newark and another connection flying back with a connection in Chicago. Not once did we depart on-time. Newark was a disaster. We had our flight cancelled obtained a second flight but the customer service rep never suggested we try to get an earlier standby flight. Nobody called us from standby until I questioned the boarding attendant minutes prior to takeoff but managed to get onto the plane only to sit on the runway for over an hour because of a backup radio malfunction which ultimately caused the flight to be cancelled. After 7 hours we made it to Boston. Going home we arrived in Chicago and again on United's commuter connection we had another 2 hour wait while something on the plane was fixed. Service was poor especially in Newark where there were two hundred people waiting at customer service to rebook and two reps staffing the computers talking on a phone and letting a plane load of customers wait. Bottom line is that I almost could have driven to Boston from my home in Ohio and not lost much time.,Detractor
"  Flew Mumbai to Da Nang (or tried to) via Hong Kong with my wife and our 21 month old daughter. Flight from Mumbai to Hong Kong was fine, crew also. The trouble started when we got to Hong Kong about 20 minutes late and were met at the gate to be told we had already been shut out of the connecting flight to Da Nang. The connecting time was 1hr 10 minutes. I question why Cathay sell this route if they are going to operate on such a tight tolerance. We were taken to the desk where the ground staff first tried to fob us off with a flight 24hrs later and hotel. No good, not least because my wife would have needed a visa to leave the airport. Next, we were told to come back in 2hrs, and they took our boarding passes and gave us some vouchers for breakfast. I suppose better than nothing, though this is what it gets you. Though we were business class, no lounge available as we were the wrong side. When came back 2hrs later to the appointed place, things took on a nasty tone. First, the ground staff said they knew nothing about our situation and could not help because they needed the boarding passes. They even told me our connecting flight had already left - thanks for that! After trying in vain to get them to move, in the end, asked them to sign a statement with me that they did not know anything and so could not help - I said I'd leave them alone after that, sort things out myself and deal with Cathay later. They would not sign anything and said it was 'meaningless' to do so. Finally, another supervisor came over and we were eventually put on connecting flight via budget carrier and Vietnam Airlines via Hanoi. The only positive of this was that at least there was a Cathay staffer helping me with going in and out of immigration and check in /out of bags, laborious though it was. I repeatedly asked them to ensure the bags were checked through, which they said was done. After that, we were left to our own devices for a few hours, no lounge or anything even though we were business class and had a young child with us. The replacement flights were all economy too. Cathay still weren't done with us yet. When we got to Hanoi, thought it would be safer to check - lo and behold our bags weren't checked through. So once more, had to laboriously lug them between terminals, check in again. One finally arrived in Da Nang, 12h late, wrote a complaint and cancelled the return leg. Asked Cathay to refund 50% of the unused ticket and any difference for going via another carrier (there was none, as it turned out) since they could sell it on and it was 2 weeks away. I guess it was naÃ¯ve to think Cathay would treat this reasonably, alas, after waiting 3 weeks for a reply, Cathay rejected it, hiding behind no refund policies and other than apologizing and offering USD150 / adult in travel vouchers, that was that. Any further pleas were met with a delayed response, apologies for the delay and hiding behind those policies. So we ended up seriously out of pocket, (whilst Cathay probably resold the seat too) hacked off with appalling treatment on all fronts. Never again will I fly this airline.",Detractor

All in all had a great trip to Punta Cana. Travelled from Newfoundland via Gander/Deer Lake. Sunwing almost had the deal sealed as a repeat customer. Check in from Deer Lake was terrific. Staff were excellent. Flight down and crew were also great. The Sunwing check in experience to come home left us feeling robbed and disgruntled. At some point Sunwing needs to incorporate 'Discretion' in to their operations. At the end of the experience getting off the plane back home I was left with the 'lasting' feeling that everything was a mere money grab for Sunwing when I had supposedly already paid for a 'Premium Options' package when I purchased my package. They are the masters at smoke and mirrors when I compare Sunwing to other tour operators I have used to travel to the Dominican Republic from Atlantic Canada in the past. Neither my wife nor I will rely on Sunwing to do that again if it is within our power to determine so. Ironically I don't really think that Sunwing even cares.,Detractor

"I am laying on the terminal floor as I type this. I was scheduled to fly to ORD from MCO this evening at 6.45. There were heavy storms in the Midwest so our flight was initially delayed. This happens. However the way this airline handled this delay was nothing short of appalling. The website said the flight would be delayed a little less than an hour. Upon arrival at the gate there is absolutely no info on out flight. Finally after 3 hrs the young woman at the gate tells us that the flight should get to Orlando around 12.15am and that's ""all she knows"". We all wait. Meanwhile the skies are all clear in Chicago and all other flights are starting to get moving. Then at about 11pm we are told that the plane has not yet pushed back in Chicago and is sitting at the gate and now the flight will be around 2:45am. At this point we all start to ask if the flight will be cancelled so we can all make other arrangements and find lodging. The attendant once again says that this is all the info she has. One man asks ""you work for the airline can't you at least call to see if you can find anything out?"" Her response ""no I can't."" She eventually disappears. Then shortly after midnight a man get on the intercom and informs us (very casually) that the flight is cancelled but ""since it has do to with weather we aren't going to make any accommodations for anyone. If you want we can give you s number that you can call to try and figure this out fit yourselves."" They preceded to write down the same 800 number from the website on ripped pieces of paper and hand it out to anyone who asked. In defence of the attendants they seemed like they honestly had no idea what was going on and were just as frustrated as many of the passengers. Upon calling the airline I was put on hold for over 45 mins with no response. All in all it was an awful experience and the incompetence of this airline seemingly knows no bounds. I am currently stuck in Orlando with a choice of paying over $700 for a one way domestic flight or renting a car and driving 20hrs to get home because this airline cancelled my flight and offered no solution or assistance whatsoever.

Food was outstanding and the wine choices were top notch (including a 2003 Brunello di Montalcino). All flights were on time or early.

"Tijuana to Mexico City. The Aeromexico boarding process is very inefficient by the desk staff as well as by cabin crew. Flight attendants are not interested in helping passengers to accommodate the luggage. The groups for boarding make no sense and make the process inefficient. There are aspects of the onboard experience that are no better in Aeromexico when compared to a low-cost carrier and it does not justify paying higher prices - for example, the service and attitude of crew, space between airplane seats, no food onboard (at least Volaris sell this), poor baggage allowance (Interjet allow 2 pieces of 25 kg, and Aeromexico 1). The only advantages perceived were quicker check in counter and the ability to take a ""carry-on"" on the plane, which in the end was no advantage, because these had to go down to the aircraft hold for lack of space.

"Saint Martin to New York JFK. We should have know from the start of this flight with the mayhem at the airport that this was not going to be good. We finally boarded and then had to wait on the tarmac for an hour due to heavy air traffic. The Captain kept us up to date, but still we were an hour late. There was one FA in Business and three in Economy. They announced that the beverage service would begin shortly and that passengers in Business and Delta Comfort were entitled to complimentary drinks, which was one of the reasons I booked DC in addition to the additional legroom. The beverage service started and we were in the second row of the Comfort seats. Everyone around me ordered soda, coffee, water but no one order an alcoholic drink even though it was late afternoon. When the surly flight attendant got to me I asked for a double gin and tonic. Without smiling she asked if I wanted the whole can. I figured it would save her time so I said yes. She couldn't find tonic in her drawer, harrumphed and walked back to get one. Upon returning she asked if I wanted one cup or two. I told her one would be fine. As she opened the first of the two gin bottles she looked at me and said, ""I'll give you these two but that's all you're going to get."" (She wasn't kidding.) I was dumbfounded. I didn't have any intention of ordering more, but I didn't need her to ensure I knew I wouldn't be getting any more - regardless of the fact that I was in a seat entitled to ""complimentary drinks"" (no mention of a limit). She pushed her cart to the next row and moved on. Later in the flight I wanted some water and got up and went to the rear galley, where the three FA's were enjoying one of the cheese and cracker snack boxes. They were talking and I didn't want to interrupt, but waited until one of them noticed me standing in the doorway. After several minutes one of them did and asked, ""What can I get you?"" ""A bottle of water please."" Her terse reply, ""We don't have bottled water,"" to which I replied, ""Fine then. A cup of water please."" She turned around, tossed the cup on top of the bin of ice on the cart, sloshed some water in the cup and handed it to me, never asking if I wanted ice (the water was room temp). I returned to my seat, looked at my husband and said Delta sucks. I understand if FA's are miserable when dealing with nasty passengers, but when the passenger is being polite there is no need to be surly and curt.

This is my first and will be my only experience with Spirit Airlines. I flew from Houston IAH to Orlando and when I arrived at the ticketing counter in Houston after I stood in line for 10 minutes told me that if the agent had to print off my ticket it would be $15 but that I could do it for free at the ticket kiosk. After I left line waited for a kiosk printed my ticket returned to line I was stunned to discover that Spirit Airlines charges a $45 fee for checked luggage and $50 for carry-on luggage. After paying this egregious amount they told me that my bag was 5 pounds overweight. When I finally reached the gate boarded the plane and began pulling away from the gate they informed us that there were problems with the plane's navigational system and we would have to return to the gate but it would only take a few minutes to correct. Long story short after the navigational system was fixed the plane's toilet malfunctioned. 2.5 hours later we were still at the gate. To soothe irate passengers they began passing out cookies. But they only had enough for less than half of the passengers. If you were in the 1/3 section of the rear of the plane where I was you didn't get a cookie. No complementary drinks either. They finally told us that we would have to deplane and return to the terminal. We didn't leave Houston until 3 hours after the scheduled departure time. The seats don't recline.

 Fort Lauderdale to Houston. This was our first time flying Spirit Airlines and it was absolutely a pleasant experience. The seats on the plane provided ample space and our flight attendants were absolutely amazing. They were very nice and accommodating of any request we made. It seemed as though they truly enjoyed their jobs and serving others. We were so pleased with the service that we applied for the rewards Mastercard as we definitely plan on flying with Spirit Airlines again. We just hope we bump into these guys again. The level of customer service they provided definitely stood out.,Promoter

"London Heathrow to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. First flight on Boeing 777, Doha to Bangkok on the A380. Both flights with excellent service and food. Seating on Boeing 777 okay, terrible on A380. My review concerns the latter part of the trip. We were late arriving at DOH - no explanation or apology. So we were then late at the departure gate, where our boarding passes were checked 4 times - with the staff standing in sight of each other - crazy. The seats on the A380 lower deck were cramped and legroom was short. At least one person had their dinner tipped in their lap from inconsiderate 'seat recliners' in front. When the pax in front of me reclined their seat, I couldn't watch my screen. I wear glasses, and with the screen so close to my face I couldn't focus. Sleeping was not comfortable, with my knees jammed against the seat in front (I'm average build, 5'10 height). When are airlines in cramped economy class, going to restrict the amount seats recline?",Passive
" Milan to Shanghai via Zurich. I go the the airport, I drop my bag, I queue 40 minutes at the gate for security checks and, after that, I go to the duty free. While walking around, I look at the screen and notice that my flight to Zurich has been cancelled. I walk back to the metal detectors area and I ask what I should do. They give me instruction on how to exit the airport from the duty free area and they suggest I go back to the check in desks and ask for a new ticket. I exit a door and I find myself in the arrivals area. I walk around the airport and go back to the departures. I finally arrive to the check in desk and I ask for a new ticket. They guy puts me in the next flight with a 50 minutes connection time to run to the next flight. When he is about to print the new ticket, he asks me if I have any bag to check in. So I tell him that I have already checked in my bag before. He replies that I have to go back to the arrivals, walk to the Lost & Found Items office to get my bag and then go back to his desk. They are not only cancelling my flight but I also have to do their job in fixing the bag situation! I walk again all the way to the arrival, I go the office and they let me access to the luggage area. I get my bag and walk again to the check in desk. I finally get my new ticket, drop again the bag and I ask for an express pass because I have already queued for 40 minutes and I don't want to waste my time again. I ask for a special pass at the Zurich airport cause I have to go thru borders and I only have 50 minutes available. The guy refuses to do so because these privileges are only given to First Class passengers. After all this drama, I finally go on the plane and I understand why they have cancelled my flight. The plane was basically empty and they were flying passengers of 2 different flights. I arrive in Zurich, run to the second flight and I eventually arrive in Shanghai. When I get my bag I discover that it is broken. Arrives the day I have to fly back to Milano. Flight is at 9.50am and because it takes me 1 hour by car to get to the airport, I get up at 5 to get ready. At 5.30 I check my emails and I see 2 emails from Swiss that they sent me both at 4.20. First email: SWISS Flight Delay Information: LX189/11Dec2017 - Flight is delayed 2 hours Second email: Dear SWISS Customer. We regret to inform you that your original travel itinerary can no longer be granted due to an irregularity to one of your flights. Therefore we have rebooked you to another solution. I am sleepy and I don't understand what is going on so I try to call the customer service. Too early, and the China CC is still close. I try to call few European CC and I can't get thru. I decide to go to the airport and see what is going on. They put me on a Finnair flight from Shanghai to Milano via Helsinki. I eventually arrive in Milano at the same time I was expected to arrive if I was flying with them. Despite both times they found me a solution, I just cannot accept and consider normal to have so many problems on 2 out of 2 flights.",Detractor

"I flew Air France from Manchester to San Francisco via Paris CDG on a business trip to the US. Their first class fares were pretty reasonable - at just over Â£3500 for a return journey which while some will think is excessive - others will know that business class fares can easily exceed this for trips across the Atlantic. Air France use Flybe for some flights from MAN - this part of the flight experience was shocking - with a 2hr delay out of MAN, so bad that I had 20 minutes to make my connecting flight with AF. This is where things most definitely picked up - I was greeted at the door of the aircraft by my personal Air France assistant who drove me to the CDG-SFO aircraft. From leaving the MAN-CDG flight I was onboard the CDG-SFO flight in under 10 minutes. However if I'd not been in First with Air France, I'd probably have not made the connection so my experience here is for a La Premier experience. Air France A380's are very spacious with 9 first seats, which give the design there's an abundance of personal space. They seem to have 3 versions of their first product, with the A380 having the older 2 of these. They are both flat bed but offer less privacy than their new product which I believe is only on certain Boeing 777 routes. The newer of the A380 first suites is okay with a larger privacy screen - I got this on my CDG-SFO flight. However their older product, which I had on my return journey, has a very minimal privacy screen. This made me slightly uncomfortable as I didn't want my fellow PAX to see me mouth open snoring away during the night flight back. Seat comfort on both is very good. The seat has recline and leg support both electronically activated. Plenty of storage space with a large drawer under the ottoman. I had (according to my sleep tracker watch app) 6 hours of sleep with a 2 hours of deep sleep. Which is pretty good for an airline ""bed"". They do have a liner which gives some additional mattress style comfort and easily one of the best duvet/pillow combinations I've had in the air - apparently courtesy of Sofitel. The IFE is at best fairly basic with the generic slow to respond touch screen, but it's functional. Some of the functions didn't work (camera views) but overall it provided the service. Interestingly the screens in Business are significantly bigger on the A380 than in first. However where Air France are excelling is the service you receive as their La Premier customer. This really is simply the best end-to-end flight experience I've had from any airline (when flying AF not Flybe). I was contacted a few days prior to my flight to ask if I needed anything specific. My Air France assistant also personally ensured that both West and East bound my bags made the flights - coming back on board to confirm this to me despite the ridiculously short connection times. On my return flight the fist class cabin was completely full - yet the service remained consistent and personal throughout, I fly very regularly and this experience with Air France have just made them my preferred choice for my long-haul travel.",Promoter

" Johannesburg to Sydney. Qantas has a huge problem staffing their call centres, desks, help-chat lines, and website. First be aware, that if you are using a browser that is not Internet explorer it does not work. Firefox does not work. If you try to access their online chat, it comes back they are too busy. There is no wait line. If you try to call it is a good 30 minute wait, at least. To save money the airline has clearly cut back on essential website design, and staffing needed to help customers. In fact there is no phone number even listed on their website that I could locate. Folks we are talking about a seriously deficient airline, unable and unwilling to assist customers. They do this, even though they charge extra for helping! So even making money charging for help, they cant be bothered. Pathetic beyond belief.",Detractor
"  Flew Egyptair from Toronto to Cairo. Pleasantly surprised. After reading all of the bad reviews about this carrier we were worried that it would a brutal 10 plus hour flight from Toronto with no alcohol service to soften the ride (dry airline). I'm happy to say that the level of service was on par with Cathay Pacific (Toronto to Hong Kong). Two full meals with a snack as well, flavourful and large quantities for airplane meals served with real cutlery. They provided blankets, pillows and a wonderful little travel kit that included a toothbrush, eye mask, socks, pen and moisture wipe. The washrooms were kept clean the entire flight and the airfract in general was clean and in very good shape. The 777 we took to Cairo was newer with more leg and seat room than the older model for the return flight. Book in staff as well as flight crew were all pleasant and fluent in English. The English movies are somewhat limited but you'll be able to find a few newer ones to fill the time (at the time of this review I was able to watch 'Birth of a Nation').

Flew from JFK to Dubai in March 2014 with final destination Lahore Pakistan. Liked the new A380 but economy seats are not comfortable as compared to 777. The worst part is window seats are useless because A380 double window distance is too wide to enjoy looking outside. The meal service was terrible both ways. Only 3 distinct ethnic foods in menu and usually then ran out off some of them (usually what I liked). I complained and was told that its very difficult to serve 400+ economy passengers and take care all of their food types. I was dismayed by the answer. Their 777 from Dubai to Lahore was old. I usually fly using PIA which is a direct flight from JFK to Lahore. Unless I want to see Dubai or this route is short I will never use Emirates to go to Pakistan. Don't see any major difference. PIA is not bad at all when you actually compare with Emirates.,Passive

Amsterdam-Dublin and Malaga-London Gatwick. Staff have been professional and polite although I noticed some of the staff do not have English as their first language and could try harder to communicate more efficiently. One all of the flights I took departure was roughly on time and although in the budget category of airline Aer Lingus offers a good alternative to the more expensive carriers. I do not like the policy of charging for bags and found the website rather unfriendly - the latter is my only real concern. The new terminal in Dublin is very welcoming too. As a non-EU citizen the process of gaining UK and Irish tourism visas was hard and the Schengen visa regime is also very complex and appears to be applied in a random manner.

"  Toronto to Tampa on AC Rouge. Check in was painless using the priority lane. Boarding was by zone number and somewhat orderly. On board the interior was new and fresh. The single biggest issues is how tightly the seats are packed. We had preselected emergency exit row which made a huge difference. Otherwise, I cannot see how anyone can travel long distances in such cramped quarters. The crew were friendly and professional. The FA serving us was on her third day on the job but performed as if she had been doing it for decades. There is no inflight service to speak of other than snacks for purchase and non alcoholic drinks. The IFE which is streamed over your personal device was simply abysmal with dated movies and very narrow selection. Flight left and arrived on time.

"  Istanbul to Montreal on Turkish Airlines. Check-in was relatively quick and efficient. Enjoyed the lounge and its vast amenities ahead of boarding. On board, the hard product looked in decent shape with comfortable seating in both upright and lie-flat positions. My request to be relocated to another seat was honoured allowing me to travel with a vacant neighbouring seat. Catering was once again below the standard I had previously experienced on this carrier and definitely below business class catering on the Asian and Middle Eastern carriers. There is clear evidence they are cutting corners with catering which is unfortunate as it used to be their main differentiator. The FA's were attentive and promptly responded to requests. The biggest issue in flight was the cabin temperature which was uncomfortably hot and took a long time to regulate after many passengers complained. Also the toilets could have used more attention which I had to point out on two occasions. The IFE was OK and had a decent selection of movies and a great music library. The free wifi worked well throughout the journey. We were late departing but arrived on schedule. Upon landing, we disembarked via the stairs as we did the last time I traveled on this route.

MEX-LAX on B737-700 fair legroom. Aeromexico has an odd confusing boarding procedure - instead of using boarding groups based on seat rows just like most of airlines they call passengers by seat type: window middle or aisle.

Paid the same price as a regular Air Canada business ticket but definitely did not feel that we were flying business. Staff were young and trying their best but could not pacify the unhappy passengers in ""business class"". I decided to make the best of it but its difficult to enjoy your flight when everyone around you is so angry. The iPad we were given was a joke! Movies were not even close to be current releases. Every time I paused the movie I was forced back to the beginning. Very frustrating. I think the worst part was the passengers from economy coming up to ""business class"" to use the lavatory. I had an aisle seat with people from the back of the plane forming a line beside me. If I wanted people to hover around me I would have booked economy. When I asked the attendant if they should be up here she said no but did nothing about it. The attendants had no control over the situation. We were in the last row of ""business"" on the way home and had the first row economy person constantly pushing on my seat. Again this is something you expect in economy class.

"On December 18th my new wife and I were traveling home from the Riviera Maya, Cancun where we spent our honeymoon. We arrived at the Cancun airport to a one hour delay. This is understandable. At the baggage check-in, I was informed I would have to pay 40 dollars to check my bag. On the way to Cancun this was no problem, and we traveled with one bag for the both of us. Why was I charged 40 dollars? Then the delay extended an additional hour. Once we boarded and took off I noticed some of the worst service. The flight attendant kept treating customers like children and conversing with the pilots at the front of the plane for several hours, meaning passengers had to use the latrine at the rear of the plane, creating a long wait. We arrive late to Denver, went through customs and arrived at the baggage re-check station. We waited, and waited, and waited. Finally, a fellow passenger dialed Frontier from their own phone for information. We were told to travel to the front of the airport and wait in line at the main check in station. Mind you, there were probably 400 people in that area. After waiting 2.5 hours for our now delayed flight 571 to Salt Lake City in a line with no direction or information, we arrived at the ticketing counter for baggage drop.

Wait and fly out on Wednesday (mind you it's Sunday night at about 1230) or take a refund, which could take 5-10 business days to receive. Frontier offered no other help, offered no condolence for their errors and simply pushed us along and said not our problem.

After a short night in a hotel we had to go back to the airport to catch our new flight. We had been told that we would all be sitting next to each other and that there wouldn't be any delays in our flights. We were mistaken. Once we landed in Phoenix we waited three hours before we even boarded our plane, this was after they did a last minute gate change. Even after we had to wait three hours for our flight, we had to sit on a hot plane for an hour and a half before it even took off. We had been told we would land in Chicago by 2 pm. We didn't arrive until 5.30pm. With myself being pregnant all of these changes, delays, and cancelations were very hard on my body. Not only did we have to pay for a hotel but we had to pay for an extra day on our long term parking. When I emailed this airline, they apologized and said that there wasn't anything they do with cancellations or delays. My husband and I have flown a lot. This was our first flight with American Airlines and it was terrible. Go with another airline when you find your self booking.",Detractor
" New Chitose (Sapporo) to Kushiro. This wasn't my first time with ANA and definitely not my last. However, it is my first time flying a 72 seater Bombardier aircraft as it is a very short haul flight. The trip was completely smooth and the cabin crew were smiling and extremely friendly. The seats were very comfortable and the legroom was satisfactory. The boarding was a breeze even though the check took almost forever due to the 26th of November falling on a weekend but we had no problem waiting in line.",Promoter
"  Working in Paris and living in Alicante, I travel home for the weekend on a very regular basis. Vueling are never, ever on time which, for a business traveller, is unacceptable. May I also wonder how I can pay euros 77 to fly Paris to Alicante and two days later fly the reverse trip for over euros 200? I travel to Alicante on 10 Nov 2016 and return to work 13 Nov 2016 and the cost is euros 890! I'd love to understand the pricing management and suggest Vueling provide regular business travellers, the folk that keep them going 12 months per year, with some form of stability. As they run such a very poor operation, they expose themselves to the most brutal criticism by being always late, poor inflight food/service/comfort, and rip off fares. easyJet are a refreshing difference, at least they take off on time.",Detractor
Flew BKK-AKL on older 777-200. Expected a tired old plane and variable service: hurrah for low expectations. Seat was angle-flat but surprisingly comfortable. Crew were super-attentive and nice. Food was some of the best I've had in the air.,Promoter
"  Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and that's something I haven't seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doen't feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I don't think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.",Passive
"Jetconnect Qantas: This little Kiwi subsidiary of QANTAS does ""across the ditch"" only and we flew from SYD-WGTN then home AKL-SYD. The crew were without exception fabulous people on both flights. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Food was average seats appallingly tight and hard. I am 5'7in and my knees were pressed hard against the seat in front of me. The poor passenger next to me in the middle seat could not find enough room to eat his dinner so I leaned out into the aisle to help him with space. This however meant the flight attendants kept banging into me as they passed. They apologised profusely but the aisle was so narrow they couldn't help it. Even for 2hrs 45 mins this was economy at its most uncomfortable. Never again. I feel sorry for the crew working in such a narrow space.",Passive

After reviewing the webpage for Rouge I charged up my laptop and tablets to make use of the entertainment system on board that streams content to your device. For the flight to the destination the onboard system malfunctioned flight attendants were unable to make it work for any passengers. For the flight back home it was working however after trying to stream the content for 30 minutes on each of my devices I asked the flight attendants why it was not working and they replied that the service is for Apple customers only. Air Canada Rouge should specify that only Apple products will work with their systems. Seat pitch was uncomfortable in the A319. On the way to my destination attendants came only once with food and beverage service for a 4.5 hour flight. Also I was under the impression that Air Canada had to hire bilingual staff members where the only French that the flight attendants were able to speak was when they were reading the safety demonstration card and the landing card. They were not even able to provide accurate translations of the Captains announcements. Not impressed.,Detractor
" Chicago to Paris. Flight got delayed by 5 hours due to technical problem in aircraft as per announcement made. All the passengers were in the aircraft waiting for it's aircraft. Due to delay in flight in Chicago my connecting flight in Paris to BOM. Air france arranged us in other flight from Paris to Hong Kong and then to BOM. I had to wait for 12 hours in Paris airport as the airline did not give any accommodation and gave 11 Euros voucher that can be used only 1 time. That voucher only got us coffee and sandwich and we were at airport for 12 hours. Due to this delay I reached 24 hours later than the original time at the destination. My Baggage got lost and I received it only after 2 days. When I called Air France for compensation for the seat I reserved they said the flight was delayed due to bad weather and there is nothing they can do about it, they just gave me a $50 gift voucher, my seat purchase was itself of around $75.

We asked if there was anywhere else on the plane where we could have an empty seat between us. They said no. When we got on the plane it was less than half full and there were empty rows everywhere!

Cabin crew asked cleaners to come on but none came into the plane and it was not cleaned. Passengers sitting nearest to the offending WC were advised it had been flushed out and would be OK, though the strong and unpleasant smell persisted throughout the flight. Cabin crew urged us to sympathise as they were having to work with the smell. They confirmed the state of the plane would be reported by them on landing. I doubt that Ryanair will respond.

"  I'm reviewing a booking, not an actual flight: I booked Denpasar - Manila on 15/11/2016, with a 2 hour transit at KL. Some days afterwards I received an e-mail from AirAsia saying the flight from Denpasar / KL was rescheduled leaving me 10 minutes between flights. There were 2 links: One for a telephone number which I called and whose lady said she couldn't help. Another for a chat that was consistently unavailable for 2 days. Also a e-form, which I used twice, but with no answer. The email itself couldn't be answered. After several tries on at least two days and two hours (in total) waiting, I managed to contact the live chat. I found out they would keep my money at least one month, if I'd cancel and ask for a refund. I had to search for alternative flights myself,on AirAsia website while chatting - they didn't help on any regard. In between, the chat was timed-out. So I had to wait again and managed to change the flight to the only option that allowed me to arrive on time at Manila. That forced me to stay overnight at KL. AirAsia didn't offer any compensation for that. I'm still waiting for the next e-ticket, and for the next chapter of this nightmare.",Detractor
"We left Heathrow at 10.15pm, due to arrive in Dubai around 8am, so this is an overnight flight as I see it. So I didn't understand the logic of serving us a full dinner an hour into the flight and then breakfast 2 hours before landing. The cabin lights only went off for about an hour between these times, so overall it was almost impossible to sleep. When we checked in online we (couple with toddler son) were not given 3 seats together but the staff on the ground at LHR managed to talk someone into moving so we ended up together. Service on board was okay, but not up to the standards I have experienced in the past. Overall though, I cannot recommend this airline and flight for this route - if you are staying in Dubai you have had no chance to sleep and therefore you are going to have to manage 2 days awake in a row and probably not have a chance to enjoy your day in Dubai.",Detractor
Madrid to Bogota via Frankfurt. Excellent flight to FRA with good hot breakfast of Spanish omelette and spinach bread and jam with plenty of drinks! Upgraded to business class with my partner using miles. Only issue I have with Lufthansa was the transfer to Terminal C which includes having to exit and go through security once again which is always slow at FRA airport. Senator lounge in C very nice and cosy with direct door access to the gates. Service onboard to Bogota was excellent despite my food choice not being available even third row into the business class. The food portions are smaller but the drinks service made up for that with the crew members being super nice and efficient. I have always enjoyed Lufthansa since 15 years in general but the new miles and status earning system is somewhat disappointing but perhaps necessary with the overcrowded lounges and lack of free seats when using miles.,Promoter

SYD-LAX 21/6/14. Great service happy crew A380 great aircraft - quiet and smooth. Food ok hot snack good. Arrived on time. Onward to JFK flight up ok. Flight back to LAX 3/7/14 delayed due to storm boarded aircraft but sat on tarmac waiting. That is acceptable however the temperature in the economy section was dangerous even a crew member said it must be over 40 degrees. Of course the back section was the only hot area. The captain made several apologies but we still roasted. Food on this flight was a disgrace. Crew were great and agreed all was not good. Also the entertainment system had not been changed from the June program. A380 back to SYD 9/7/14 paid extra for exit row on upper deck discovered that this is really a walkway for passengers to get to the toilet.

Generally I have no problem with Ryanair flights quick and effective service. I do think though more thought could be put into their timetable as flights arriving in Manchester at 23.45 means that there are no transport options from Manchester airport other than by Taxi very expensive to get anywhere from the Airport.

"Plane was late to arrive to begin. Our flight was at 1.47pm plane arrived at 2.10. Flight attendants couldn't be found.

As soon as everyone was on the plane the pilot announced that the mechanical issues hadn't been resolved. We were in Fort Myers in 80 degree weather and sitting in a plane with no AC. Eventually all told to de-board. We waited in the airport again for another 1.5 hrs with still no answers other than they were still holding the connecting flight. Finally told that folks that had connecting flights needed to go back down to the Spirit ticket booth it was going to be first come first serve. Once all 60 passengers were back down at the ticket booth we again waited for at least 2 hours in line waiting for answers. They put us up in hotel rooms but never told the hotel and never notified the hotel shuttles that there were 60 people who needed transportation. We finally left the airport at 8.15pm! They gave us a food voucher $7 per person and $50 credit to fly their airline again. They are short staffed the planes are dirty and the seats don't recline.

"  It was my first time with Air Canada flying from London to Montreal. I have to say that the aircraft was good indeed. However my strong impression was that AC was like a budget airline. Inflight entertainment was limited and didn't work for my wife. We needed to ask to re-set it several times. Seats are not comfortable because armrests have built-in remote for inflight entertainment system and lights and you switch it off/on every time when you place your elbow on it accidentally. Serving food: items constantly were dropped down, flight attendants were picking them up from the floor and put on your table. Indeed it was better than United based on my many-year experience but still very close to it. My personal impression - Ryanair is treating their passengers a little bit better inflight - more genuine and attentive. Also, Montreal airport don't recognize Star Alliance membership card privileges for priority check-in which was disappointing (but it was not the airlines fault, but the airport ground staff). AC can be airline of choice indeed if there no any other suitable options.",Detractor

We were given no food or water or blankets by the airline.

They shouted at passengers and refused to put passengers on the emergency evacuation list. They would just write ""total refund"" on the tickets and say they had absolved responsibility of us.

The connection time in Bangkok was only scheduled to be 1 hour which made the connection tight and tighter with the delay. Upon arriving in Bangkok there was a line up for transit security however it moved along fairly well. Because of the delay I boarded with everyone else and that was no a problem for me. As I was seated one of the flight attendants was clearly not amused or friendly that I had not been seated before. That Thai friendliness and welcome was not there. A few minutes later as we were taxing for take off the youngest of the flight attendants in business aggressively and rudely barged in to the space in front of my seat and grabbed pillows and rudely announced that they were going in the overhead bin. I have never experienced such rudeness from one of the Thai flight attendants before. This same flight attendant repeated her performance prior to landing in Seoul. I coupled that with the lack of welcome and friendliness upon being seated and it was not the greatest of experiences with Thai this time on that flight. If they were not pleased with the tight connection and my inability to be earlier to my seat, then they should take that up with their airline and not blame me. As for the other flight attendant with the rudeness, she needs to be more familiar with appropriate etiquette. The quality of food, cleanliness of the aircraft were of the same very high quality that I have come to know and appreciate with Thai.

LGW-PEK-HKG. LGW to Beijing on a A330 delayed 40 minutes and was completely full. Reasonable inflight AVOD entertainment system containing a selection of Chinese and Western movies. Food served was edible and expected from economy class. I liked was the super fast removal of food trays. Beijing International Airport is huge and with less than 2 hrs to catch our connecting flight proved stressful. Found no time to relax look around or for something to eat. Onward flight on a A320 seemed to have more legroom. On arrival at Hong Kong in the early afternoon one of our bags had not been put on our flight but fortunately delivered to our Hotel later that evening. Found return journey stressful due to time constraints. Flight delayed and so had just over an hour to get our connecting flight. Fortunately flight delayed 25 minutes so we managed to get on board. Our ticket price to HKG was quite cheap but I probably will not consider this route again.,Passive
"  Baltimore to Las Vegas. I needed a quick get away and found a return trip ticket on Spirit Airlines online. The advertised price was for $299, but with all the add-ons which included ""paper boarding card"" charge, I paid $398.19. Got to the airport and the attendant guaranteed that I could get my return boarding card in Vegas on my return. I was charged for my little carry-on, seat on the plane (even though I didn't request special seating), checking in at the airport. Got on the plane, seats were crammed like sardines. Fast forward to my return, on the day I was meant to return, I realised I didn't get an airline notification like I would from my preferred airline, so I called Spirit to figure out what was going on. To my surprise, i was told that my ticket was a one way ticket, and if i wanted to make it back to MD, i had to buy a one way ticket for almost $400. I contested this over the phone and was advised to speak with a manager at the airport, as I couldn't speak with a manager over the phone. Got to the airport 7 hours before the take off time (because I was desperate to catch the redeye flight out as I had to be at work in the morning), the manager told me that if I was to be in MD, I had to buy a one way ticket. I pulled up a similar advertised return flight for $259, and showed the manager that this was not fair to advertise a price and swap terms after purchase, she disregarded my position. With no choice, I grudgingly paid for a one way leg home, but I will never forget this experience.",Detractor
"  This was the worst experience I've ever had on an airline. The airline had a layover in Chicago for more then 6 hours. Bags were expensive, no details were given on why there was a delay other then â€œthey need to check if they have enough gas,â€ and their back up computer might be crashing. That alone left me with zero confidence in a safe trip to New York. We taxied for over an hour to return to the gate. The ride was for the most part smooth, until landing which was horrible. To top it off, when we landed we couldn't even get your gate right away. We only get a half cup of water in this whole experience from the airline. I would never recommend this airline again. The cheaper option is NOT worth it.",Detractor
Travelled from SIN-HKG and back. Check-in counter waiting time really efficient at Hong Kong Airport Express station and Singapore is really efficient. Aboard flight good movies and TV shows shown on StudioCX and the food was very fresh and tasty. Good flight attendant service with the newest economy class. Clean cabin and toilet and quiet flying experience on Airbus A330-300. I think CX should improve on the array of movies and TV shows as they are fewer than other airlines. but so far I am satisfied on both flights.,Promoter

"  I flew with KLM on the 3rd April from Lisbon to Newcastle via Amsterdam. Before I arrived at Lisbon Airport, I checked in online using the KLM app which was a very smooth and easy experience compared to some airline apps. On arrival at the airport I checked in my bags at the bag drop using the boarding pass which I had on my phone. The staff around check-in were absolutely fantastic, couldn't have been more helpful. As I boarded the aircraft, I was given a very friendly welcome by the cabin crew. The flight departed 15 minutes behind schedule due to an issue with ATC in Amsterdam. Once we were airborne the crew began to serve breakfast which consisted of a Dutch breakfast sandwich and a choice of drink. The sandwich was actually quite nice although the appearance did not look so tasty. Throughout the flight the cabin crew continued to serve light snacks and beverages, and the service was outstanding. The time lost at Lisbon had been made up during the flight and we actually arrived at the destination 5 minutes early than anticipated. I would certainly fly with KLM again for their outstanding service and value for money.",Promoter

We had to wait for five hours before they let us go to the hotel. Some passengers got food vouchers, some didn't. Even the information they did not provide properly. Basic things like what's next or where to meet, all not clearly explained. The information given was very limited. Staff attitude extremely bad and arrogant. It's already awful enough if you involuntarily have to spend a night extra because your flight is delayed. As for the hotel accommodation. It started with the check-in where tired passengers had to wait in the bus, while tiny batches of people were allowed to check in. Once we got off the bus we had, additionally to our already four hour wait at the airport, wait again for half an hour to get our room cards. Three hours before check-in I already knew that I'd be staying in Novotel, how come they were not prepared and just handed over the keys. What terrible logistics!! In the morning after shower I found there was no body lotion and toothbrush. In the bathroom it said: if you need anything just call 75.

Once I went to this reception, the chap didn't even understand what I wanted. So together we called 75 and now they delivered.

The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers.

"  The new interior cabin updates seem to ""look"" nice, however, it is clear that whoever designed this has never worked on an aircraft. The lavatories walls are so narrow it would be very difficult for anyone over 190 lbs to manoeuvre freely. Not only are the lavatories almost half the size, the space has cut into the galley so that now you feel terrible standing in the way of flight attendants with no where to stand that is not inhibiting either other passengers or the attendants. The staff were warm and friendly, but they too confessed these updates were difficult for them becuase they can no longer even see when passengers request assistance or have questions from their seats. The call lights are too low on the overhead space for attendants to see and there has been zero adjustment on leg space and comfort for passengers. In addition there was no inflight entertainment on a 5 hour flight. After this terrible experience, I have now been struggling to return home to Los Angeles from my work trip to Louisville, due to Delta's system crashing, their apparent logical response to the thousands of passengers stranded is to prolong and cancel even more flights putting the issue off. At some point all these people are going to have to fly home, cancelling more flights due to overcrowded scheduling is actually making the problem worse. While I have time to afford not going back to work immediately (since I haven't been able to get home yet and this is now the third flight I've finally been able to snag a seat) there were dozens of military at ticketing with no flight options out so that they could arrive and report for duty and training.

"Flew economy class from Manchester to Johannesburg via London Heathrow with British Airways. Flight from Manchester to Heathrow delayed for over 2 hours, very crowded waiting area. We had paid extra for emergency exit seats chosen before departure (only available exactly 14 days before flight). This was well worth the money paid. The emergency exit seats meant we had no one sitting in front or either side of us, giving plenty of room to stretch out for an overnight flight. Again we had paid extra for upgraded meals and these were very good quality, well presented with proper cutlery, also served before the rest of the cabin enabling us to then stretch out and relax. Good entertainment system. All the advantages of premium economy without the price. We had the same service on the way back without the prebooked meals as these are only available from Heathrow. Dont know why it's not available both ways as the meal is basically what they serve in first class.

Incredibly, British Airways serve such mean meals in business class on a transatlantic route, where they make most of their money, I was hungry after the meal so later on decided to 'raid the larder' but they only had sweet, which I generally avoid. The menu states there would be yoghurt and other stuff there they were not available. The FAs were embarrassed and got me some cheese.

Although the seat transformed into a flat bed it was so narrow you had no space to turn over and the blanket just kept getting dropped into the aisle way of the plane.

I'm 90% sure they shrink the requirement test basket so people have to give them more money. United may often be the cheapest airlines but they will get the rest of the money out of you somehow.

Travelled HEL-RIX-KBP and back 19-22 July. The online booking and check-in (opens 72 hours before flight) straightforward website easy to navigate. All flights (except the last leg which was 25 min late on arrival) on time. The planes were oldish 737's (except RIX-KBP which was DH4 turboprop) but seemed in good shape and were clean. Seat pitch probably a shade less than major European airlines. The staff was very friendly and onboard service was impeccable. Nothing is free though.

"Flew with KLM to Lima on via Panama and direct flight back. Flight to Panama was operated by Boeing 777-200. Quite an old one, with screens 10Ã—15cm or so. Seat space quite narrow. The crew was quite helpful. Good experience was to fly on the second leg with Copa airlines: just 3.5 hours flight, but big touchscreens, very polite crew and comfortable seats. Flight from Lima operated by quite new Boeing 777-300. Bigger screen and better choice of entertainment, but the seats were very uncomfortable even for a person like me just 1.7m height. Almost no reclining. Vegetarian meal ordered - terrible. KLM is reliable, but the price they ask for their services is quite high for what you get. I'll definitely avoid them for flying to Asia as they are obviously still far away from service level of Middle -East carriers and when flying over the Atlantic will try some other options.",Passive

"12.00pm flight, Sunday 2nd August, however we weren't airborne until 12.40pm due to aircraft arriving late from Dusseldorf. Big queues at Check-in/bag drop in T2 but managed well by Staff. Only major complaint here is the extortionate â‚¬50 to Check-in a bag at airport (one-way) as I'd forgotten to online. Flight itself was staffed by an excellent crew who willingly engaged with passengers throughout. Service was relatively quick for such a packed flight and prices very reasonable.

"Heathrow to LA in Economy. This was my first and last time flying with Air NZ. Firstly the best aspect was the crew friendliness. They seem good fun and genuinely happy to help. The ones I chatted to really hate the 777-300 aircraft. One said it wasn't designed to 4 seats in middle row and she seemed genuinely sorry for the customers squashed in a middle seat. A result of having an extra seat in the middle has meant that the aisles have got narrower. I really felt sorry for the crew having to walk sideways a lot of the time. I was in an aisle seat and was constantly being bashed by the crew and passengers waking past. Clearly they are trying to squeeze out as much profit at the expense of customer comfort. I paid extra for a ""preferred seat"" and apparently this includes a row behind a leg room seat. Not sure why I had to pay extra for this seat that was no different to any other regular row. When the guy in front put his seat back I felt so claustrophobic and could hardly see my TV screen. The food was very average and I waited over 80 minutes to be served an alcoholic drink with my meal. Being offered a glass of tap water just after take-off is very poor and not what you'd expect from a very expensive ""4 star airline."" The choice of films is very limited and very few new titles.

"Flew Cathay Pacific Airways from Hong Kong to Manchester. Arrived at the gate at the appointed time but were kept waiting for over 20 minutes before boarding commenced.

Cabin crew provided drinks while we waited and eventually we took off some 40 minutes late. The meal was served after some delay due to turbulence and the chicken dish that I chose was well done but still edible. IFE was working correctly with good choice of programmes. Lie flat bed was comfortable for sleeping if I raised the back rest slightly above horizontal. Cabin crew came round frequently to see if anyone wanted drinks or snacks. Breakfast was served quickly and the dim sum selection I opted for was good.

ORD-JFK/LGA-ORD - July 2-5. I keep seeing a huge increase in great attitudes from flight attendants on AA flights. Very personable and fun on both flights. Departed ORD on-time and landed at JFK early - but taxied around JFK for 30 minutes before getting to our gate. Dinner served was pre-ordered on aa.com and the chicken was very tasty. Return to ORD from LGA - plane was only 60% full and the three flight attendants (DCA-based) were having a great time with everyone. Lots of talking laughing with passengers and very personable.

" When I booked a trip from London Heathrow to Kelowna, I didn't notice that the third leg of my trip was with Rouge. However, this oversight became abundantly clear when I boarded the plane. At 5'11"", I couldn't sit normally in my seat without my knees in the back of the traveller's seat in front of me. I am also tired of opening the seat pocket to find the last traveller's garbage left behind for me - and this on a flight where the pilot accounts for our thirty-minute flight delay because the plane was slow to get through the (overnight) cabin service. This reminded me that it was not my first time on Rouge, having flown between Calgary and Kelowna on this AC service and experiencing the same thing once in the past. I didn't even bother with food or drink on the flight, opting to grab something at Pearson instead. Super economy service, without the super economy price. Avoid at all costs.",Detractor
"  My experience with WOW was disastrous. On my flight from Paris to Los Angeles via Keflavik, my flight got delayed (initially). After I was already in the boarding gate another customer (not a WOW Air representative) came to the gate and told us that any customers having connecting flights to the US except for a couple of locations wouldn't be able to make the connection and need to go to the front desk. So, I did, only to find out my flight was canceled. WOW didn't have any employee at Paris, so the representatives were third-party contractors who knew nothing, some told us the delay was due to a medical emergency, others due to overbooking, and others due to problems with the airport. It was a mess! Then they made us get in line again just to give us a paper to call WOW directly. After waiting for 40 minutes on the phone and around 1.5 hours to get my baggage back, WOW offered me to get me on another flight almost a week later (what a joke)! After spending several minutes discussing with this person over the phone I realized he couldn't do anything and I took their offer for a reschedule flight almost a week later. Then I was told to head back to the front desk (again) to get help on the hotel accommodations for which I had to wait in line (again). When I finally got there, the representative told me he didn't know if WOW could cover my hotel and meals, which was ridiculous because WOW put me on a flight 6 days later! So, I had to wait for them to get an e-mail from some mysterious people in Iceland to approve. I waited more just to find out that they wouldn't cover my stay and that every day I had to call WOW to find out if I was going to be covered (unbelievable). For that day at least, I was covered and I was personally exhausted after spending all the afternoon in the airport. Then the next day I found out that WOW would cover my expenses for that day as well. Then WOW changed my flight (again) to one departing from Brussels, and was told that shuttle from Paris to Brussels would be arranged for the day after (at least I was leaving sooner), just to find out around 9pm that my arrangements were canceled as well. WOW air offered me to put me on another flight, but after all that I had gone through, the uncertainty about covering my hotel expenses, multiple flight changes and 2 days being stranded, I was emotionally done because WOW doesn't care about its customers and had zero guarantees I could get home anytime soon. So, I told them that I wanted a refund for my ticket. That same night I bought a last-minute ticket back home and submitted a claim to WOW to get a full refund for that ticket I had to buy. To my surprise (or not so much surprise at this point), I was told that my claim would be reviewed in 8 to 10 weeks! It's been almost 2 weeks and nothing from WOW Air. After this experience, I didn't believe how terrible an airline service could be until now. I will definitely be avoiding WOW Air for the rest of my life, their cheap prices are not worth the risk as they are simply incompetent and unprepared to deal with situations like the one I just described.",Detractor

We were flying the little, but new Bombardier CS-100/300. The cleanliness of the aircraft was impressive, as well the boarding was completed very quickly. The pre-departure facilities were a bit disappointing as Swiss is just offering a face towel with a bottle of water, no good sparkling wine or Orange juice, but it wasnÂ´t the big deal, as they provided pillows and blankets as well. A few minutes after taking off the Maitre of Cabin started the service. The flight time was only 1h and 20 minutes. They served a small lunch, more on a cold canapes meal which was with fresh salmon with avocado and a quinoa-bulgur salad, with some swiss cheese. The food quality was good, but the dessert made the meal, a berry-apple mousse with a vanilla foam on top. After it as the hostess saw I was still hungry she came to me with some croissant, still hot and offered me a hot coffee, what a nice touch! The upgrade was definitely worth it.",Promoter

LCY to ZRH April 2013 Business Class. Good service in the air unfortunately let down by the policy of allocating both A and B seats in business class in a 2-3 configuration. Their competitor on this route only allocates either or in the same scenario. On this flight there were 8 rows of business class which equals a capacity of 32 seats. There were only 8 passengers so why Swiss insisted on seating solo passengers right next to each other in the AB seats and leaving so many rows free is a mystery.,Passive
This is a general review of American Airlines. Since 2000 I have flown with AA more than any other airline racking up nearly 1 million miles most in Economy some in Economy Plus and some in First Class. Maybe it's because I have so much experience that little things and small delays do not phase me but I have rarely had a problem so bad that I felt the need to contact AA customer service and I've never written a negative review. Yes it would be nice to get a snack with your beverage like Delta gives but I can bring my own package of cookies or peanuts if I want. And yes the MD-80 aircraft does not have inflight entertainment but they've had powerports on MD80s for a long time and then I've got a fully-charged laptop and smart phone to entertain me. Yes I've run into weather delays in Chicago during the winter which is why I connect through Dallas whenever possible. Yes it would be nice if they would upgrade some of their gate areas with more power plugs and offer their gate agents some sort of incentives to be a little nicer with regular passengers and not just us elite passengers. And yes sometimes they want more money for the same route as a competitor and those are the times I book with another carrier. But throughout my near-million miles and 14 years flying AA I still recommend the airline to my friends and family to get them anywhere in the world they need to go safely on time and for a reasonable cost.,Promoter

"London to Vancouver. Why there is zone boarding no one really knows nor understands as every traveller is confused about when to board. Zoning hampers boarding greatly as it does not consider row numbers only the ticket price as common denominator. Zone 5 by far what most people have is the last, but since row numbers are all over the place there is a long line-up throughout the plane, since row 19 or 40 are boarding at the same time. Food on Air Canada flights is tasteless. Flight attendants on this flight were not helpful when asked for things such as special meals.

Of course those of us seated in the rear of the plane were left with the vegetarian option only as they ran out of the chicken dish halfway thru. The cabin crew had absolutely no control, people got up when not supposed to and most of their requests were totally ignored. The second beverage service was stopped halfway thru as it was time to prepare for landing. Hoping against hope the return flight would be a more assuring experience, the opposite was true. Again the vegetarian choice only, no offer of being able to purchase an alcoholic beverage (the traveller in front of me was told it was too turbulent to serve wine). Two of the staff sat in the back playing on their phones, a third had a blanket over her head trying to sleep.

The seat, the seat space, the food and the cabin crew were above average. The most important thing for me was the handling of the flight delay. There was a one hour delay in Zurich and it was obvious there is no chance on a 11 hour flight to land in Hong Kong in time. I had a connecting flight to Manila. The time between flights was only 50 minutes, which is a bit crazy. To my surprise, the ground crew of Cathay was prepared to name about 35 passengers with that connecting flight to Manila, gathered us in the front of the airplane so we could get off the plane right after it stopped at the gate. On the ground they guided us quickly thru the airport to the connecting flight, which was waiting for us. We landed in Manila over one hour later as scheduled, but at least for me that was okay.

SIN-ZRH in economy. A343 was kept in a very clean and good condition despite being old. Cabin was quiet during flight and the seat was comfortable. Flight was very smooth. Only gripe was the cramped leg space due to the metal IFE box below the seat in front. The SWISS.com website didn't reflect correctly which seats had those nasty metal boxes. The metal box occupies about half of your leg space. Food was not to my taste unfortunately. On both legs (SIN-ZRH-SIN) I couldn't use the AVOD screen properly. Once the person in front reclines fully the screen is very dim even at maximum brightness. No matter how I titled the screen I couldn't watch the movies properly. The IFE system hung 2x on me. Crew was attentive on the SIN-ZRH but not the other way round. Pressed the call-for- attendant button 3 times on 2 occasions and no flight attendant came by.

The food served was of good standard and we were asked a few times if we would like more drinks. One crew member who said she had been with BA for many years was professional and excellent at her job.,Promoter
"  Boston to Lubbock via Dallas Ft Worth. I was at the gate with time to spare. I purposely did not check a bag, because I wouldn't have time to go to baggage claim when I landed. I understand when they just check it below, then hand it to you when you get off, but they fully checked it. I told her I didn't want it checked. She tried to act like she was doing me a favor by not charging me. Additionally, they tried to check it for the wrong city! The lady was extremely rude about it as well.",Detractor
MAD-SVO-HKG return in Economy. Perfect trip Aeroflot is trying its best to be equally competitive with its European rivals and quite manages it. The only drawback is a horrible SVO connection.

"Quick day trip to Munich and impressed with Lufthansa, specially when compared to British Airways Club Europe. The LH lounge at T2 was wonderful, although crowded in early morning. The breakfast spread was fabulous by lounge standards. Staff told me the food is by Do & Co, and hope they can provide food to all LH lounges in future. Onboard service efficient and friendly staff, I like that they still offer you a good choice of magazines even on short flights. A light breakfast served, seats reasonably okay with middle seat empty. In MUC decided to try out the ""paid"" VIP Terminal on way back - wow! It is fabulous and even has its own beer garden and outside dining area. You get taken by car to foot of steps for boarding. Return flight a similar experience and even managed to avoid Heathrow congestion and land on time, with very quick walk to exit T2. Certainly recommend them and will use again.",Promoter

20th Apr 2014 Perth-Kuala Lumpur flight D7233. 18th Oct 2014 Kuala Lumpur-Perth flight D232 in Business Class. Cabin consists of 12 seats only so is nice and quiet. Seats are cocoon style. backs do not recline but the seat does all the work thus you never have anyone in front reclining their seat in your face. Nice big pillows and doonas complete the feeling of luxury. Meals are not a highlight however. We find comfort far more important than meals. One good thing about the meal service however is you can tell the cabin crew when you would like to eat. If you want a comfortable few hours sleep where you can stretch full length and cuddle up in a doona can thoroughly recommend Air Asia Business Class. Aircraft clean and crew very helpful.,Promoter
I travel to Thailand at least once per year with my wife and always use Thai Airways. The primary reason for this is they have a direct flight from Brisbane. In the 7 or 8 flights I have undertaken during the past 4 years I have found the service to be consistently good if not outstanding seats comfortable and the food more than satisfactory to very good. I always buy my tickets direct from Thai Airways and I find if I monitor their website I can purchase tickets as cheap is not cheaper than any other agent/organisation. It is also easy and quite inexpensive to amend your ticked if you book direct even if you are on a discounted fare.,Promoter
MAN-HEL-MAN on time both ways clean cabin good leg room. 2 servings of drinks going 1 coming back. Chicken sandwich going chicken salad coming back. I flew with them 2 and a half years ago and alcohol was free but no more. Feels very greedy from their part. If you want to order vegetarian food you have to ring an expensive phone number to get it you can't order it at the same time you make the booking online really annoying. I didn't get my luggage until 3 days after arriving in Finland due to a strike so now have to go through a complaint procedure. I was told though that I may not get any compensation since the strike was illegal! Unbelievable! The help passengers got from the airport workers was very poor indeed. We had to help each other to get and fill in the lost luggage forms. The lady behind the desk said she's going home now in the middle of all the chaos and I think my form was the last one she took in. There were plenty of distressed passengers in front of her desk without any idea what to do. Absolutely appalling very bad service at the airport!,Promoter
"  Abu Dhabi to London on 10th May. My worst flight ever. The cabin crew were the laziest I have flown with. I realise they are entitled to a break but they entered the cabin twice during the flight once with lunch and once for a snack near the end of the flight. My sister could not even get any water, the crew ignored the bell and switched it off without even coming to see if there was a problem.

We flew business class Perth to Sydney on Xmas Day and Sydney to Perth Jan 17 one may expect Xmas spirit. On the Perth to Sydney flight I asked the stewardess for a glass of water and champagne about 30 mins after takeoff and was told to wait till they served the food in half an hour. She then walked off and it took 10 mins to get another stewardess as they were all in the food area with the curtains shut. Finally got a drink of water and then when food came around I was informed that from a choice of 4 only 1 was available as they had run out of the others. It was a one third full business class section and we were the second to be served! I questioned this and she grumblingly walked off and found me an omelette. We never saw the staff without having to ring the bell. Sydney to Perth again I was told to wait until the meal was served before I could get a drink of juice and wine. I got better service in economy. But the male crew were fabulous friendly and brought us drinks without having to wait until the food was served. Seats were frayed and vinyl split some of the reclining buttons did not work. Food very average. Very poor female crew and overall and I will not fly Qantas business class out of choice ever again.

Christmas Day 2013â€¦flying to Cancun with my fiancÃ©. Scheduled to arrive at 4.30pm Dec 25th in Cancun.Actual arrival time: 3.30am Dec 26th. Dec 25th 7.45 am: Arrive at airport to find flight delayed from 10 am to 4.30 pm. Offered $15 food voucher for airport or a cab ride home - no explanation of why there was a delay. We got a hotel room at the airport. At 12.00 pm the departure time changed again to 6.30 pm. At 2.00 pm the departure time changed again to 8.50 pm arriving in Cancun at 3.30 am Dec 26th. Throughout the day we tried calling Sunwing and received a busy signal every time. At 6.45 we left the hotel and made the 5 min walk to the check in desks to find no one at the desks and nothing showing on the screens. At 7.30 a Sunwing agent arrives at the desk. We asked why the flight was delayed and why there was no one there to check us in and she wouldn't answer. Once checked in we head to the gate and it is announced on the overhead speaker that Sunwing will be offering a $75 travel voucher per person for the delay. This is so distasteful considering we paid $442 per day per person for the vacation. Once onboard the pilot came out to make the announcement that they did not have a flight crew. He offered our first drink on him and first wine is always free anyway. We waited just over 2 hours for the first drink/snack cart to come around so thankfully we had brought our own drinks and snacks. That was the only time they came around. Arrived at Cancun airport at 3.30 am and as expected there was only one customs agent working. Our flight home luckily wasn't quite as bad. We only had to change gates because the wrong one was listed on our ticket wait in the hot hallway for 20 minutes after going through the gate because the planing process was so inefficient and took off 35 minutes late. We should have known not to fly with them again but we thought it a normal delay not a regular occurrence.,Detractor

Not something often served on an plane. With 42 passengers in business the crew were kept busy but were friendly and no request was too much trouble. Washrooms were kept clean, and stocked with cologne, toothbrushes, shaving kits etc. We landed on time, immigration and baggage delivery were fast and I was in the limo within 30 minutes of landing. The only slight negative was that they ran out of one of the red wines, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir, which was understandably popular.",Promoter
Flew LAX-PEK in Business and return PEK-LAX in Economy. Business class hard product on the new 777-300 is top notch. Service was very good and food quite on par with my other usual choices when flying to China including UA OZ and AC. Overall if I was flying business class I would choose Air China again if the time and price was right. My return flight in PEK-LAX was in economy. Again 777-300 hard product (seat) which includes in-seat power plug for your laptop was quite good but the seat pitch was borderline acceptable. The IFE system is good AVOD but lacks enough current Western content. That aside I would not recommend Air China economy to anyone because of the quality of the food. Quite simply it was some of the worst airline food (very low quality Chinese food). Several of the side dishes were inedible.,Passive
"A wonderful experience with Norwegian from Gatwick to LAX. The crew were very welcoming and couldn't do more for us. My husband had a funny turn - the crew were straight by his side and made sure he was comfortable and kept checking on him throughout the flight. Economy seating was good. I read reviews before I went and some of the comments were not great regarding the prices of food etc. I can only assume as its a low cost airline this is why they charge for headphones etc. We brought our own and also brought our own food as you have to pay extra online for a meal. I overheard a lady next to me complaining about the prices of food - but we brought our own as we knew it was going to be a long flight. Entertainment is excellent, all new films. No onboard wifi which was fine, I don't see that as a necessity. Would absolutely fly Norwegian again, cheapest tickets I could find with great customer service. Smooth journey. No crazy announcements like other airlines every 5 minutes. Very modern aircraft with great features and films for the kids as well as adults.",Promoter

3 legs with them: UIO-BOG (operated by AeroGal) and BOG-MDE-BOG. Everything okay in the air with nice planes (A320) smiling crews and overall a good service. Late arrival in Medellin due to foggy conditions. Problems start on the ground: I had to change my return ticket from Medellin and this was easily done in less than 5 minutes but was told I should pay the USD 40 modification fee in Medellin. Upon arrival in MDE I directly went to the ticket counter in the departure hall. After one hour in line I decided to leave. Later in the afternoon I found another Avianca office in Medellin - another 45 minutes before I could talk with an employee. My simple operation took 20 minutes.

" On the 19th December I was meant to catch an AC8670 8pm flight from Vancouver to San Diego, my first time flying Air Canada. 20 mins before boarding time, we were told the flight was cancelled because the plane needed to be de-iced and would not make San Diego's 12am curfew. Fine. Then, we were told we had to go out through customs and immigration and go re-book tickets with Air Canada. The lady at the Air Canada desk was extremely rude saying that they weren't re-booking tickets there even though we'd be directed to go there - she provided essentially no customer service. Another thing - some passengers are automatically re-booked onto flights and others aren't which is super inconsistent and something I expect a budget airline to do - I wonder is Air Canada a budget airline or Canada's national carrier? Because it is a total embarrassment of a carrier. Moreover, even though I was re-booked onto a flight the next day at 8pm, I was not given any accommodation vouchers or food vouchers or anything. I received nothing in compensation. I understand the flight was cancelled due to safety reasons, but Air Canada has appalling customer service and I will never fly them again.",Detractor

"We were booked home in January 2015 on an Air Canada Rouge flight and charged full points by Aeroplan as per the normal Business Class on Air Canada flights. I do not know how Air Canada can pass off this ""Business Class"" on their Rouge flight as equal to their normal Business Class accommodation which they offer. Clearly I questioned the Aeroplan representative when told we would fly home on Rouge and was told it is the same as regular Air Canada Business Class although not the pods but with adequate comfort and leg room. To say that the seating was inadequate would be an understatement. We have traveled Air Canada Business Class annually YVR to OGG and have never encountered such sub-standard cramped seating with minimal leg room. My husband and I are tall people this being one of the reasons we choose Business or Executive Class. I was barely able to walk when we finally landed in Vancouver. This type of accommodation can cause a health issue for many people. You charge for Executive Class and provide less than adequate Economy seating. Since 2004 we have travelled to Maui annually and paid the extra Aeroplan points for the comfort of the Business Class. In our estimation we got less than Economy. Most of the Canadians whom we encountered on Maui who had flown Air Canada Rouge Business Class were horrified and the reports we received were of great concern to us. Even though we had been privy to these negative comments we felt that being Air Canada it could not be that unsatisfactory. Therefore based on past experience we embarked upon this flight with open minds. We were quite incorrect it was far worse than anything we could have imagined. This is gross misrepresentation on the part of Aeroplan and Air Canada. If Rouge is the only flight Air Canada is offering between Vancouver and the Hawaiian islands then we will be seeking flights with other airlines in the future.

It would be great if they offer flexibility to their pax to be able to opt to dine whenever they wish (not only in a designated meal service time).

There is like 6 or 8 seats at the front of the plane that have some padding but at a steep cost. After all is said and done, tickets are about the same as flying on Delta or American Airlines.

Flew from BNE-MEL on a business upgrade award. The flight was delayed approximately 30 minutes due to late arrival of the flight deck crew from another flight but time was caught up in the air.

Upon calling them I was given the usual answer that the aircraft was changed which was a blatant lie as it was the same aircraft. Emirates need to honour the commitments they make as it was a nightmare with an infant moving right back in the aircraft so all the hypes of portraying itself as a family friendly airline was proved wrong. On the other hand IFE was great but food lacked taste and variety.",Passive
"  Booked because of the fare price. Sould have researched and found reviews before hand. Flew down from Newark NJ to Fort Lauderdale on my favorite airline, jetBlue. Fare was $64.00 all in. Booked my return through Spirit Airlines $74 booked late so understood! Get to airport with my small normal carry on I use for all my flights, was charged $59. Never in my life have I ever been charged for carry on. Charged for non alcoholic beverages and snack. Not a cup of tap water even or a small snack nuts, chips, etc. No TV, seats are like metal prison chairs, don't recline, tray size of a kindle. Had the nerve to announce to help clean up to keep fares cheap. Will never under any circumstances use Spirt airlines again. I rather pay $20 to $50 extra on any other airline.",Detractor

"  Vancouver - London Heathrow return. Nov 1-13, 2017. Overall, very good experience. Online check-in easy and quick with very easy printing of boarding passes and luggage tags at the airport kiosks. Ground staff professional. The zone boarding process can be confusing as, even though specific zones are called, passengers from other zones tend to get into line prior to being called. Ground staff don't seem to manage this boarding process well and this is not the first trip where I've encountered this issue. Planes were clean and well kept. Onboard staff were professional and efficient. Meals were tasty, which was a vast improvement over my last international trip with AC. Vancouver - London Heathrow included 1 hot meal and a very small breakfast - a slice of gingerbread and a small yogurt. This is not sufficient for a flight almost 10 hours long. London Heathrow - Vancouver included a hot meal, mid flight snack and then a hot fajita about 1.5 hours prior to landing. Frequent drink runs both flights. Overall, onboard service was efficient and well done, but not outstanding. Seats are reasonable but not overly comfortable. Onboard entertainment system worked very well both flights and there was a good variety of TV, movies and music. The only negative comment would be that AC charges for advance seat selection on Tango fares, fares are high enough without adding this extra fee. Will continue to fly Air Canada and recommend this airline.",Promoter
"  Doha to Munich. As a solo traveller I hate their 2-2-2 configuration in the Boeing 777, which they fly from Amsterdam. To avoid this I use Belgium, Germany or even Skandinavian as starting point for my trip, since Qatar Airways uses the 787 or new A350 to Doha. I was unpleasantly surprised to find out that Qatar Airways uses a leased A350 from LATAM on their Doha-Munich route. The config in business class in this plane is 2-2-2 and more cramped than the 777. Toilets were messy, service below par and sitting near the window means climbing over your fellow passenger. This was the second plane change for the worse in 5 months.",Detractor
Travel was a nightmare with unhelpful staff. Inflight entertainment was a joke - most of them were not maintained and needed repair. Overhead lamp for reading was not working and when we asked for assistance staff told said they would check it and that was about it.

No help until some angry passengers started to shout - fruit juice served. After more than 5 hours delay finally we were able to leave Kuwait for London. No apologies no manners!

" The actual experience of flying with Ethiopian is OK. Nothing special, not really on par with the transatlantic coach flights to and from Europe, but pretty standard quality of food and service that I have come to expect from flights to and from Africa. However, a colleague had a medical emergency so I had to extend my trip, which meant I had to rebook my returning ticket. I cannot express to you the horror of that experience. Despite the fact that I was more than willing to pay whatever necessary change fees and rate differences, it took me a total of 8 Hours on the phone with them to rebook. They do not allow rebooking online, which meant that I had to spend an entire day on hold with various people, which is not easy (or Cheap) from a remote part of Ghana with little cell service. Every time I would get through the hold line and speak with a representative, they would figure out a flight for me, then ""transfer"" me to their sales department, and I would be hung up on. Or I would be on hold for an hour Then hung up on. After the complete mess that was finally getting this sorted out was finished, After 8 hours of this nonsense, they tell me that I cannot be confirmed for the rebook yet because I had to pay the change fees first, In Person In Cash. What airline in 2018 doesn't accept online payments, card payments over the phone, or even wired money? Of course, I was in rural Ghana, which meant I couldn't spend 3 days traveling from there to their head office in the capital to pay this change fee when the entire point was that I was unable to travel to Accra at that time for my original flight. After 2 weeks of fighting with them over the phone about this, Finally one of the local agents tells me I can pay the money into their bank account in a city nearby my location (who knows Why no one ever gave me that option previously!?). I was very worried this would turn out to be a scam because it was a pretty sketchy set up, but it worked out in the end. Moral of the story",Detractor

" Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, she's unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn't given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn't accommodate her a wheelchair. Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight. At this point I'm besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk. Emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.",Detractor

KWI-DOH on newly refurbished A320 with 2-2 lie flat seats angled toward the windows. Great if US carriers could copy this modely especially for coast-to-coast travel in the US.

CX is always quite good, arguably the standard in how to run an efficient airline. This trip was no different and overall quite pleased. I suppose the only negative is the cabin staff are so ruthlessly efficient in how they go about their jobs, they often lack warmth and can be quite brusque with customers.

  First time flying with Etihad from Muscat to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi on a round trip with my family. The overall quality of service was poor. The crew on all flights were rude and unfriendly and lacked the professionalism. The worse experience occured during our return flight from Bangkok.

Unusually this was my first trip with FR for 4 months. CCF to STN return. Surprised to be allocated the same back row seat for both flights even though I'd not paid for seat choice. I thought these rear (and front) seats cost extra? Anyway not complaining as it meant speedy disembarkation at both destinations. Good to see that the Ryanair charm offensive has not run out of steam and they really do seem to be making serious efforts to up their public image. Return leg absolutely full but boarding was efficient enough and we arrived 20 mins early. Both flights were on two of FR's more elderly planes (those in the EI-DC* range) and frankly they are starting to show a lot of wear and tear which is hardly surprising when you consider how hard they work. Have the food and drink prices gone up recently? Â£4.50 for a coffee and a biscuit seems a bit OTT to me but I guess you don't have to buy. In summary a couple of years ago I'd have advised anyone to avoid Ryanair at all costs if there was even a vaguely convenient alternative. Happily nowadays I'm quite keen to recommend them to anyone on any route if getting from A to B in the shortest time for the least money including bags etc is a priority.,Promoter

While in the air from LA to Chicago they canceled our second leg of the flight and the next flight out was 6 hours after we landed. Had they told us ahead we could have planned accordingly.

We were told that there was no room. 10 minutes later 6 people came up to the gate late (they missed the flight we tried to get on).

Something you would expect from a regular (not a budget) airline in my opinion. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case.

" Singapore - Brisbane - Christchurch - Sydney - Singapore in Economy Class, with the CHC-SYD sector operated by Jetconnect. The A330-200s flown between Singapore and Australia were fitted with Qantas' latest-generation seat and inflight entertainment (IFE) system, while the B737-800s offered a different seat with a similar IFE system (slightly smaller selection of content). The seat pitch was more than sufficient for me (at more than 180 cm in height), particularly onboard the A330, the depth of recline was acceptable, with the moving seat pan serving to minimise the inconvenience caused to and by other passengers. I found features such as the adjustable headrests and USB ports useful, the fact that these were present onboard the B737s as well makes them all the more impressive. The service onboard was sincere, with all requests attended to promptly and courteously. The cabin crew were attentive and conducted regular refreshment and rubbish collection runs through the cabin. Only minor touches such as newspapers and amenity kits were absent. The quality of the meals served (lacto-ovo vegetarian) ranged from good (breakfast on the flights to and from Christchurch) to excellent (all other meals), with the staggered delivery of courses (i.e. rather than on a single tray) and inclusion of snacks in the meal service allowing for some flexibility. A larger selection of mid-flight snacks would have been appreciated, though, given the rather small portions. The connections at Brisbane and Sydney were seamless, when the already-short connection at Brisbane was exacerbated by a delay in the flight from Singapore, airline employees were deployed at frequent intervals along the route between the two gates to guide passengers and expedite the transit process. In summary, for the roundtrip price of SGD 1354.50 paid, Qantas offered good value for money.",Promoter

I had not flown BA long-haul for over 30 years before this flight. I flew YVR-LHR as the final sector of a round- the-world trip and I have to say I will not be in a hurry to repeat the experience. The 747-436 looked tired and ready for a refit or the breakers yard. The seat was the most uncomfortable economy seat I have ever sat in despite the headrest 'wings' which are a nice feature. The lower part of the seat backs are fibre not hard plastic enabling the passenger behind to put their knees into the small of your back. this happened frequently throughout our bumpy flight.

They gave reason as crew not available. I booked the ticket a month before and they were not able to plan it.",Detractor
"  Flew Anchorage to Las Vegas. This was an overnight flight of 4 and a half hour, plus 2 hours of time zone adjustment so the flight departed at 11.30pm arrived at 5.30am. It was on time. Alaskan Airlines has a good reputation and service attitude was good. Non-alcoholic drinks were served free several times during the flight, while others were available at reasonable cost. The checked bag cost USD25. It would be a good flight were it not due to the aircraft. It must be an early 737 and there was no TV, the seat back doesn't recline, making the 4-hr flight uncomfortable, though seat pitch was good.

CPH-CDG-MIA / JFK-CDG-CPH. I upgraded to Business class on the CDG-MIA flight operated by an ageing 747-400 but everything worked just fine cabin was clean and seat comfortable. JFK-CDG was an A380-800 aircraft. We had a delay of almost 2 hours on departure from JFK due to ATC but captain kept us informed and was very apologetic. In general food was good but it could be better. Flight attendants were outstanding especially on both long haul flights they were just some of the best I have ever had. The worst was that I missed my connection at CDG and the customer service agent wanted me to wait for 6 hours when there was an available flight 1.5 hours after our late arrival. Overall very satisfied with AF. Chapeau to its cabin crew!,Passive

" Brussels to Dubai. The worst customer service I have experienced. After booking a round trip flight, I had to change the time of the outbound flight for latter on, the same day, due to work commitments. Their customer services explained to me that I will only need to book a one way flight from Europe to Dubai as my return flight, which was already booked, will remain valid. However, one day before the date of my return flight back to Europe, I found out that my ticket had been cancelled due to â€œno showâ€, despite being told previously that I will be able to use my return flight. In addition to that, the complaint has been handled extremely poorly, with a complete lack of consideration, by Emirates customer services who repeatedly refused to transfer me to a manager for an official complaint.",Detractor
Flew LGW - MCO 26th October. Was a bit worried about BA after a lot of mixed reviews. Found the whole experience great. We were travelling with a 4 month old and the crew were faultless. So helpful and caring as they could tell we were nervous about disturbing other club world passengers. Food good - fresh and tasty. Entertainment not really used due to entertaining daughter!

"  London to Nairobi return in February, during the industrial action. We found the crew to be friendly and attentive. The food was ok, I had the spicy chicken which I didn't much care for, it was rather unusually badly prepared, with great hunks of chicken and vegetables, just not as nice as the beef my husband was eating. On the return flight, we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike, but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff. I know that there has been a lot of gripes about BA downgrading its services, but these flights were really good, and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time. Didn't much care for the cereal bars but the 2 cups of tea made up for that!",Promoter

Both our flights were on time and we had no hassles or problems. Our flight was only about 2 hrs long and we were a little crowded (not tons of leg room etc). I can see where this might be more of a problem for a longer flight but for us it was fine. The plane cabin seats etc. were nothing fancy but they were perfectly adequate and clean - all we needed for a family trip to Florida. Great value for the price - we had a good experience and will definitely fly Southwest in the future.,Promoter
" Christchurch to Vancouver via Auckland. Air New Zealand lost my luggage for four days they offered me no service at all. I had to phone them all the time for instructions of retrieving my luggage and to get status updates. Besides that, in my luggage was all my camping gear, so without this gear I could not go camping as planned and had to stay in more expensive accommodation. Also I could not provide my own meals as planned, but had to go to a restaurant. Air Nz offered a total of 200 NZD compensation, in stead of the 700 NZD I had for extra cost. After complaining about this, Air NZ stated that this is business as usual and that by flying with them you agree with these terms. These circumstances made our holidays in NZ have a bad start. But also for this fact Air NZ didn't offer any compensation. But the errors by Air NZ continued when flying with them back to Vancouver from Auckland. In Christchurch an employee of Air NZ stated we had to re-checkin our checked in luggage. In the airplane the flight attendants stated whe didn't have to pick up the luggage en re-check it in. When asking another employee of Air NZ about this (just to be sure) he stated we did need to re-checkin our checked in luggage. So we went through customs and to the luggage belt to pick up our luggage, but our luggage did not come. Asking another employee of Air NZ about this, she said we didn't have to pick it up: so we went through customs for nothing.. thank you Air NZ for wasting our time again.",Detractor

" Raleigh Durham to Providence. As usual, Frontier Airlines has multiple problems with the aircraft. The thing that has always annoyed me about this particular airline is the lack of sense of urgency. I'm so sick and tired of being told about problems 30 minutes after they've been discovered. I'm so annoyed by the nonchalant way that passengers are notified of problems. Today, for example, we boarded and had been sitting at the gate for 30 minutes before anyone even bothered to tell us that there was a problem with one of the computers. Then, after no updates, another 30 minutes later, we are told that Maintenance was still looking into the first issue and that they would ALSO be looking at an engine problem. They just so casually grazed over the fact that not only are they investigating the original issue, but they are also investigating another, potentially greater issue. No apology was given. No updates have been given on either issue in the past 15 minutes. Love just being dangled from a string. Very annoyed passenger. Update- Just had to deplane and now we will potentially have to wait for another aircraft to become available.",Detractor
"  Orlando to Sao Paulo Bogota. Avianca's quality continues to decline, from chicken and pasta and they have gone to pasta and hamburger with blue cheese. No options!

They offer cheap Chilean sparking wine as champagne.",Detractor
"  Flew Cairo to Abu Dhabi. Old, narrow bodied aircraft with uncomfortable seats. For the prices charged, Etihad should at least use decent, comfortable planes on these routes. They promote a luxury experience but this was far from it. The plane was full so economy pax had been upgraded and business was packed. Seat comfortable enough to sit in but lacked good foot and leg support and impossible to sleep in. The champagne was warm and of low quality, wines so-so and the food offering more akin to economy standard, and small portions at that. We did arrive on time and the crew were friendly enough, but Etihad business class is very disappointing on short routes. I will avoid in future.",Detractor

There are hidden fees (55 euros per way) for improper check-in, the site is faulty preventing check-in, and the customer service is not helpful or understanding.

The entire service is designed to nickel and dime customers, thus the company's business model is about tricking customers and writing special terms to catch them unawares.",Detractor
"Johannesburg to Sydney. 2 hour delay and somewhat disorganised boarding, with totally ineffective manual carry on bag search just prior to boarding. Qantas allow priority boarding for Premium economy along with business class, and the location of the cabin ensures quick disembarkation. On board pre take off drinks were served promptly. Premium economy seats spacious with good recline and footrest, and comfortable for sitting and sleeping. We both slept from for 7 hours. The small cabin, only 4 rows, is very nice, and service was good. Food mediocre, but nicely presented. Wide choice of entertainment with easy to use touch screen. Premium economy is a good offering on long haul which gives a lot of benefits for the extra cost.",Promoter
"  Well at least Frontier is slightly better than Delta, the plane was clean. The prices are great until you realize how much they charge for baggage and they lie and tell you that it is less expensive if you pay online. That is if their system let's you, if not it costs you an extra $20. Think about this if they deliberately keep 100 people a day from paying online and collect an extra $20 from each person that is $730,000 a year. Tell me they are not doing this on purpose, oh and no refunds on baggage by the way.",Detractor
Our Air Canada flight to Barcelona August 8 and our return from Madrid August 21 were saddled with cancellations delays and very poor customer service. As the 8.50 flight was getting closer to departure time on the night of August 8 passengers were first told that the aircraft had not arrived while the crew had come in. Then we were told that there was no part and it was best to wait and be safe than sorry. By 10.30 additional staff came in and said that the part had arrived. After an hour of waiting close to midnight we learned there was no crew to fly and the flight was cancelled. The station manager came in with security and more staff. The manager said that all hotels in downtown Montreal were full booked thus no hotel for us. He however guaranteed that we would be flying the next day to Barcelona and that we could retrieve our luggage and AC staff will make sure that we are comfortable. There was not a single staff member around after customs so passengers who decided to sleep in the airport went around looking for benches and chairs to sleep on. Vouchers of course were handed over but in the beginning my sister and I were told of the following: no food will be served on the flight but would be available for purchase no re-routing to catch our tour and AC was not responsible if we missed our tour. All these actions on the part of Air Canada were well orchestrated and any questions from passengers was met with Security ready to handle any raising of voices. Our Air Canada saga however did not end in Barcelona. On the way back August 21 from Madrid again the 1.30 pm flight was moved to 3.00 pm. It was not difficult to figure out again the cause for delay. As more fresh looking passengers came in to join the 3 pm flight it was clear the delay was done to combine the 1 pm and 3 pm passengers. The delay caused us to miss the connecting flight in Toronto for Montreal our final destination. When we asked Air Canada customer service if we could take an earlier flight to Montreal we were told that our luggage had been checked in for the 10.30 flight to Montreal. We could not say anything to customer service only to find out that our luggage did not arrive in Montreal in spite of the nearly 3 hour window to load our luggage. As someone enticed to fly Air Canada's direct flight to Barcelona from Montreal this airline gave its passengers a sing song routine when all passengers like me wanted to know what is really happening with our flights. Air Canada should never forget that we paid the fare they asked for be it from a travel agent or online.,Detractor

Flight 55 to Chicago due out Sunday morning at 9.30. Sat in airport all day to find out at around 3pm that the flight had been cancelled due to a technical issue. No information from the staff all day. Had to find out what was going on via the website. The flight got rescheduled for Monday. After another hour delay we finally boarded the same aircraft that they where having issues with the previous day. We set off to the runway only to turn back with a technical issue. We were then sat onboard the aircraft for a further 6 hours as they where having the same issues as the previous day. After the 6 hours we where informed that the flight was being cancelled yet again. By this time it was to late to make alternative arrangements. The downfall for me was the job I should have been at on Monday morning had to be cancelled as I could only get there by Wednesday. Total disgrace.,Detractor

They literally looked at my bag and my girlfriends bag, and slapped a sticker saying ""there is no more cabin area for your luggage"". All the while, there was plenty of space for our two carry on and then some. If you going to own an airline and operate one, you should take in to account how much space and what can be brought on the plane, accordingly. Not when you are walking on to the plane.

I missed a flight by 5 minutes, because of my incoming flight from Europe was late due to security issues. And even though it was the last flight of the night they would not hold the plane, for 5 minutes, and they wouldn't put me up in a hotel because it wasn't their fault. Well it wasn't my fault either.

We went there and of course there was no coat. We filled all the information out and have heard nothing. It's a shame that someone from Southwest would take my coat. It didn't make it a few hundred yards from the plane to the baggage claim office where the lost-and-found was. Lots of losers in this world.,Detractor
" New York to Cartagena. We booked two business class tickets for a direct fight to Cartagena that was supposed to land at noon, so we can make our boat connection to Rosario Islands. A week before our trip, we got a notice from Avianca that due to the strike, they had to reroute us through Medellin. The new flight with the layover would bring us to Cartagena at 4:30 PM which meant we would miss our boat connection. I went to the NYC office to cancel those flights and had to book a new flight with Jet Blue last minute. The agent who filled out all the cancellation forms told us it will take 6-8 weeks of the refund. At 6 weeks I called the headquarters to see what is the status of the refund. They told me to have patience and it will be more around 8 weeks. They also said they would escalate the case. At 8 weeks I called again and this time they said it will be more like 3 months to get the refund, but they reassured me they would escalate the case again. The following week I went back to the agent in NYC to see what she can do. She discovered that the claim was still pending and had been â€œNeglectedâ€ (her words). She told me it would serve me better to start a new claim to get new attention to the case, and she reassured me that this would not mean that I would lose my turn and have to wait another 3 months from then. At 2 months and 3 weeks I called the headquarters again, and with such chutzpah they told me my new claim was filed only a week ago and I need to wait for 90 days from the new claim to get my refund, which would mean basically 6 months from the date of the cancelled flight. As I really refused to take no for an answer, they put me through to the manager. She told me the reason the NYC agent issued me a new claim number was because there was a mistake in the way the original claim was filed and it had been rejected, not neglected. Meanwhile, nobody had bothered to call me when such rejection was done to tell me there was problem with the claim and see how we can fix it. She was also adamant that she cannot do anything else at this moment and that I will have to wait 90 more days from the filing of the new claim to see my refund. She again said she will escalate the matter, which by now we all know means nothing. She refused to give any assistance at all. Many phone calls to the headquarters and a few trips to the NYC local office, I'm still not even sure when or how I will ever get back the money from my two round trip business class seats on Avianca. They were happy to take thousands of dollars from me, changed our tickets on us without consulting us first, and now are creating all kinds of roadblocks and delay tactics in refunding the money. Even though they made a mistake in filing of the refund claim, they never bothered admitting to their mistake, nor are they taking any responsibility for a mistake that was done by their agent. Basically, they're hoping I would just shut up and disappear so they can keep thousands of dollars for a flight they cancelled on me.",Detractor
"The plane was boarded well in time however the computers had to be rebooted and the flight left 10 minutes late but time was made up anyway. Keeping in mind that Qatar Airways has been voted #1 in the world it is hard to find fault with anything. My only comment would be that over 5 hours is a long way to fly in a narrow body jet. Transiting Doha is now much better with the new terminal. And even better if you have a silver card as you get access to a lounge in Entebbe and Doha. And for most sectors out of Entebbe (Uganda) Qatar offer the best price, which makes them unbeatable really unless you want a direct flight to Western Europe.",Promoter

Boarding by remote gate and long bus ride, twice the number of passengers on bus as there should have been, but that's Chinese safety! Cabin staff were seen to talk with a few Chinese passengers but they just scowled at us westerners. Asked for coffee 3 times and it never came, water was served lukewarm and no beer or wine was available - a simple ""no"" was the answer twice! This flight was cheap, but not cheap enough for what was awful service, surrounded by very noisy travellers - they shout across the middle aisles, walk around when seatbelt sign is on and staff just ignore it.

" Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude. I fly twice a year long haul and based on my experience, I don't want to fly Emirates again. Their publicity and reality are worlds apart, get your acts together Emirates!

I flew out of LAX at 6 am July 9 2014. The flight took off at its scheduled time. The only complaint I had concerning this flight is it makes no sense to me for the airline to load the front of the plane first. It would be more efficient and there would be far less congestion in the front of the aircraft. For the flight from LAX the ground staff were very sloppy and inattentive. United has rules concerning the size allowed for carry-ons. Many passengers were allowed to bring full-size suitcases on board and of course the overhead bins rapidly filled up. I was pleased to see the staff at Dulles for my return flight were enforcing the rules and numerous passengers had to check over sized carry-ons. Charging an extra $25 for the first checked bag will preclude my flying United in the future.,Promoter
In general Alaska Air has been my number one go to airline. They have been customer service oriented for as long as I can remember. The only bad experience I had was when I had MVP Gold status. I called the then Horizon MVP line and asked to have my husband seated next to me. They refused since he was not an MVP Gold. So I called the Alaska MVP Gold number and they put him next to me no questions asked. As for booking I recently booked a vacation through Alaska and had a difficult time. It would not pull in any of my account information from either my personal or EasyBiz account so I had to enter it all manually. Also unlike when you book just a flight you cannot pick your seats in their vacation page. I found both of these items to be frustrating. I doubt I will book a vacation through their site again.

" First of all, I should have checked the reviews of Frontier Airlines first before using it. Flew Miami to New York. So far, the worst ever experience in an airline. I have never felt so insulted, ignored and badly treated. The airline staff at the gate are so rude and lazy. When you asked questions, they do not care to answer or they do not know. My flight was delayed when I traveled to NY and then delayed by 3 hours when heading back to Miami. I emailed the airline for compensation and they told me they couldn't do anything.

Booked a trip to Vegas and thought we were flying with Air Canada until we got our itinerary that said Air Rouge. The airplane itself was run down and dirty. The seats were uncomfortable but thankfully we paid for the exit rows so we had more leg room. The overhead bins are small and you likely won't get 2 roller cases in the bins. We sat in Row 27 A and C on flight 1851 to Vegas and my boyfriend froze the left side of his body on the flight down. The crew seem very disorganized and no one seems to really know what is going on. There would be an announcement in French only and as an Anglophone I have no idea what they were saying so here's hoping it wasn't overly important. During the flight we had some turbulence and the seat belt sign was on but people continued to use the washrooms and the crew allowed them to do so. Don't think they actually have inflight entertainment as this isn't the case. We downloaded the app onto our Ipad and truthfully it was a waste of time. Their idea of inflight entertainment is to allow you to watch 10 mins of a show and then it crashes forcing you to have to log back on and try and find where you were in the show. This happened to us several times and finally we gave up because a 44 min show would have taken us well over an hour to watch and it was frustrating to have to keep logging back in. One gentleman on our flight even returned his $10 Ipad he borrowed as it's a waste of money when the entertainment doesn't work. We have decided that if we can't fly with Air Canada not Rouge then we will book with another airline regardless of price because this was horrible.,Detractor

I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though. So same airline for two flights but two quite different levels of service.,Passive

Went to the galley area during the long flight to stretch. The cabin crew member working there at the time was very unfriendly and almost rude. Later when asking another cabin crew member for a drink in the same galley area I was met with a dry expression handed my drink I said 'thank you' with no acknowledgement from this crew member not even a smile. The overall product is quite good delicious food huge selection of drinks often very good service. However there are also extremely rude and unprofessional staff. This is not an isolated experience. Before landing one of the crew members complained to the purser about the cabin crew on the flight. He expressed his views in detail with passengers nearby. This crew member spoke so loudly that it was impossible not to hear him. I found this extremely unprofessional to say the least. It was very unsettling.,Passive

2/12/12 Warsaw-JFK Business Class. Smooth check-in at Warsaw Airport Business Class desk Priority Lane through security two lounges to choose from. Flight on time with B767-300ER. Refurbished Business Class cabin but still looking a bit worn out however seat controls worked properly. Very friendly and attentive cabin crew took my coat offered champagne orange juice or water with some newspapers explained how the seat works etc. After take off Purser greeted every Business passenger individually offering menu wine list and explaining dining options. Opted for regular service and it was fantastic. Tasty traditional Polish dishes 5-course dining with good wines and those little touches like small chocolates cherry liquor No carts on a cabin everything served by hand by knowledgeable and friendly FAs. Given small Digiplayers with some movies TV shows music and games big cart with snacks fruit basket sweets cakes little sandwiches were put in a galley as a mid-flight snack. Before landing we were served hot dinner. Landing cards and customs forms had flight number and date written already so attention to details was superb!

"  I was booked to travel British Airways from Heathrow to Dublin airport in Ireland. I arrived at the airport within the permitted check-in times and was held up by a longer than anticipated queue. I went to a check-in bag drop counter where the staff ignored me for a good few minutes as she conducted a personal conversation with one of her colleagues. I was asked to place my bag onto the conveyor belt and issued a boarding pass and baggage receipt. The woman behind the counter then took the boarding pass back and after a few moments I asked her if there was a problem. She nodded and said her computer system would not let me board as my bag had been offloaded even though the bag was still on the conveyor belt and she had issued me with a boarding pass. After 15 mins she told me to take my bag and go to a different area for help. It was bizarre. I joined a second queue where a very helpful man explained that the first person I dealt with had not checked me correctly due to timings. He made a telephone call and as my flight was delayed by almost one hour he told me not to worry and to make my way to through security to the gate. Boarding was not efficient. One would expect better from BA. The queue was poorly managed. The cabin crew with one exception were frosty and functional. One cabin crew member, an older lady was superb and I saw her help a young mum with a baby and answering questions from 2 Japanese people with limited English. This member of the cabin crew was a superb representative of her airline. My seat was not clean and there were crumbs on the floor. The captain made very clear announcements and there was a nice drop-down screen to show the route of the flight. A cup of tea and a small packet of crisps were offered. My bag did not arrive into Dublin with me and so I had to join a queue for Swissport. This is where my nightmare started. A uniformed woman who said she represented BA told me my bag would â€œmost likelyâ€ not arrive until tomorrow. I asked her if the bag would be on the next flight and she said no and suggested that I leave the airport and that a courier would deliver the bag to where I was staying. I took her advice only to receive an automated email that same evening to inform me that my bag had indeed been placed on the next flight. Over the next few days a nightmare began. I spent many hours calling Swissport and their courier DPD. To be fair the DPD staff were helpful and told me the reference number from Swissport was wrong. Swissport insisted the reference number was correct.",Detractor

Flew Shanghai to Paris via Moscow. What a nightmare: aircraft ancient (still had ashtrays in the arm rests) torn and dirty seat covers toilet unspeakable by mid-way through the flight and the stop-over in Moscow is always stressful. Why do they make everyone disembark with all their hand luggage check the luggage through security when it hasn't been anywhere but on the aircraft since the previous security check and then make everyone get right back on the very same plane? If you are seated at the back of the aircraft then you spend your whole lay- over at Moscow airport standing in a queue to get through security. The food was almost inedible and my Chinese travelling companions played cards on the backs of the airline seats throughout most of the flight and all stood up to get their bags out of the overhead lockers when the pilot announced that we would be landing in three minutes! The cabin crew went almost apoplectic.,Detractor
KL713 Amsterdam - Paramaribo January 2015. Absolutely superb. The new KLM Business Class is excellent.

But as I said that it is an unacceptable sum they started to ignore my emails and I haven't received a cent. The planes were old, entertainment system is probably from the early 90s. The only good thing was that they provided free hotel in Addis Ababa for the connection overnight. Make sure you ask for it at the airport check-in.",Detractor
I fly from MSP to TPA several times each winter. I have used Spirit several times. I fly with a service dog. I have had very few problems.

AVOD screen is big and the choices are much better then on my last flight with LH. The food is the same as in normal Y, but there is not always glass or china, most drinks are served in plastic cups or paper cups for hot drinks. During flights nobody showed up to offer water or juice. Our lactose free meal ended up in a vegan meal which was inedible. For breakfast we got the same vegan meal again, even complains where not even solved. The seat is nice and very good, but the food and service on this flight was not worth it.",Passive
Flew from Washington DC to Helsinki via Reykjavik in business (Saga) class. I'm not a tall person (5 ft 4) so my feet could not touch the floor from the seat. The so-called footrest was a little metal pad right on the floor so it didn't help either. As the seat upholstery was slippery I could not get any traction for the back from that either so that the entire trip was very uncomfortable. But the worst experience was the luggage delay. OK it happens that the bag sometimes does not arrive and you may have to slum it in your flight clothes for a day. But this time the bag was found quickly but it could not be transported 100 km out of Helsinki in more than 3 days! If I had known this I would have taken a taxi or rented or car and had retrieved the bag myself.

PER-DPS-PER. Positives were cost clean aircraft and a good selection of flight times. However I was concerned with the level of hygiene in the toilets. On both flights soap was not provided which essentially means that nobody was able to wash their hands properly which is poor infection control particularly when there are 180 people confined to a small space for a long period of time. Flight attendants and crew could be more clearer on the PA system as well. Food good but a lot cheaper if pre ordered.,Passive

They can keep their champagne (one way only) and the awful food they serve and lower the cost. Paid more for the extra legroom I don't know how anyone could sit comfortably in the regular seats. Flew American last year with a layover in Miami and would definitely consider again. Lovely updated aircraft roomy seats no meals but price was over $150 less. Only reason I booked direct was I was travelling with my 90 year old mother the layover would have been too much for her.

We will never fly with this airline again. Flight out of Moline Il was delayed for an hour because the airplane wasn't there. We finally get a plane and find out from the flight attendant the delay was caused because there was no ramp at their last stop. The pilots did an awesome job getting us to Dallas on time.

"  Copenhagen to Keflavik. I recently had a very disappointing incident concerning luggage with WOW. At the gate I together with quite a number of other passengers was charged round $US100 extra because my carry on case was marginally larger the the extremely small dimensions specified by WOW. As an international traveller, I can't possibly have a specially small case just to suit WOW. My case is on the small side if anything and to my knowledge acceptable to all reputable airlines. Having paid the excess, I was directed to go on board where of course my bag fitted perfectly into the overhead locker. No need to put it in the hold apparently. As someone who has run a business for over 40 years, I know that firms that pull cheap stunts like this are well down the highway to insolvency.

This is the worst airline ever. Only use them if you are desperate and if you are plan to have a terrible experience. I have taken hundreds of flights good and bad and Frontier is one I will never take again. I've only used them three times but each time they have been delayed. I mean 20 minute delay fine but each flight has been delayed over an hour and usually close to two. One was weather related and okay of course that happens but other times there has been no excuse. And when I have talked to them on the phone they give no information for why its delayed! I've only taken this airline because it flies into an airport right by my parents so its easier when I go to visit them but Id much rather fly to Newark or JFK and take a train to my family!

"I have mixed feelings about United Airlines. The few upsides of the flight from San Francisco to Boston were the fact that it was direct, cheap, and punctual. Also, for some reason, I was able to use Wifi without paying. However, I was not impressed with the cabin service. We started off the flight with an announcement that there was something wrong with the plane, which is never good news to hear. My seat had a disgusting stain and felt like cardboard. There was no complementary dinner even though it was a night flight, and the price was very high. The inflight entertainment system was nonexistent, and the flight attendants did the safety introduction the old-fashioned way: acting it out in the front of the plane. Unfortunately, I was in the back. United is a so-so airline, one that should be avoided unless it's the cheapest or the most convenient. Other than that, I do not recommend it.",Detractor
" Austin to Palm Springs via Minneapolis. Comfortable B717 to the Twin Cities. 6am flight called for a Bloody Mary, had a refill at the gate too.

Accompanied by very fresh fruit and more Bloody Marys. Departed and arrived on schedule. 2 hours in the renovated Sky Club in MSP. This is where Delta has really started to pull ahead. Their lounges have upgraded food options, with hot and cold items available. The standard free liquor is fine, but reasonable cost to upgrade to the premium stuff. B738 from MSP to PSP, a 3.5hr flight. An extremely nice lunch with chilled Salmon and Quinoa, followed by dessert.

On screen controlls are nice, but also controls have been aded on the armrest. Consequently, any arm on top or near it sets off the screen, volume, light, calls the attendant and so on. The only solution was to not rest the arm period. Does not work. They also no longer give any snacks on board or food. Internet or connectivity are not offered.",Detractor
"In the last couple of years, British Airways has been refurbishing aircrafts nad has minimized the leg space to ridiculous levels. This, not only for economy, but also in Business class.

In addition, they have this policy for 2 bags, but one going under the seat in front of the passenger - this applies even to Business Class!",Detractor
"  Second in the queue in business class check-in line, there was an issue with the pax in front of me. He was on his phone trying to sort something, the agent on hers, for 10 minutes - nothing resolved. I later saw this pax in Y on board so don't know if he was only in the line due to OW status. At last, an agent in the Y class line said to her colleague â€œWill I take him?â€ â€“ meaning me â€“ and her colleague replied â€œUp to you.â€ I was being checked in and asked which lounge I used at CDG. â€œDunnoâ€ she said. She asked another agent - â€œI've no idea."" It was so rude / bad I just laughed. I think they thought I couldn't speak French. When I got to the AA lounge (I'd checked before which one to use) the agent said â€œThis is not where you're supposed to be.â€ When I challenged this it was only resolved when a colleague came over to him and explained OW Sapphire rules to him. A sign saying RJ pax could use the lounge was on the desk in front of him. Flight to AMM was OK-ish, but no proactive service from the crew. Meal was served and cleared away as soon as they could manage it â€“ twice, not-finished drinks taken from my table â€“ the crew disappeared behind curtain for the rest of flight. The food was mediocre, the in-flight entertainment limited and uninspiring. The AMM lounge a dump. Poor food, nasty toilets, birds flying inside, no one to let you in shower room. Cannot imagine its state if toilets anything to go by. Security staff at AMM incredibly rude and aggressive. â€œWhere you go?â€ barked, is really not good enough. Flight to BKK full. Most pax in business class appeared to be Royal Jordanian staff, behaving as though on a company outing. As we taxied two were standing in the aisles, using their phones, the woman beside me (no ideas who she was, young and pretty, very popular, both captains came out to chat to her) went into the cockpit for take-off and landing and I did not feel the FAs had proper control of the cabin. Breakfast consisted of 3 types of pastry with a bread roll on the side. No nuts with the welcome drink, no bottle of water, surely the minimum in business class. It was available if you asked for it, but you had to ask. The bar area onboard was used for a flight attendant to store her suitcase. Flights back were more of the same. The flight from BKK only better as only 9 pax in business class. In the middle of the night I pressed the bell to ask for some sparkling water. It took the flight attendant 5 minutes to come and offer to â€œhelpâ€. It's not as if she was busy. I got what I asked for to the letter, a glass with water in it. No ice, no lemon, no offer of anything to go with it. Someone needs to tell Royal Jordanian that training their staff to snarl â€œEnjoyâ€ at English speaking passengers whilst slamming a glass on to the tray and high-tailing it back behind the curtain before any more awkward questions can be asked does not make a premium passenger feel valued. The volume on the passenger announcements on the A321 to CDG was so loud that when the pilot made an announcement mid-flight the dozing man in front of me almost leapt out of his skin. I've learned my lesson. I thought as a One World airline it would be roughly on a par with other carriers in the alliance, if not necessarily as good. The ticket cost about Â£200 less then Qatar Airways and it allowed me to try a new aircraft type for me (the Boeing 787). However I cannot recommend the airline at all. I would sooner not fly than use them again. My main feeling is one of having been cheated out of my money.",Detractor
"An A330 which I realise is not new to the CX fleet, but this aircraft was downright grubby. The padding on the seats was non-existant, and the fabric was worn and threadbare. These seats were unacceptable, and for an 8 hour flight, especially so. The cabin looked dingy and in need of a good clean. The cabin staff were are jaded as the furnishings. No sooner had we left the ground, than everyone was ordered - and I mean ordered - to close their window blinds, and they had to remain closed for the duration of the flight. So much for having a window seat. At one point, while going to the washroom, I literally had to jump out of the way of one of the cabin staff who was heading in the opposite direction, and I never received so much as a ""thanks"" as he barged past. The meals were served with all the enthusiasm of a billionaire serving in a soup kitchen - thankfully it was all over quickly. The food itself was ok - passable for economy class. Overall, this was grim. I'm seriously trying to decide whether to give up on Cathay Pacific after this. It's a shame - this used to be a great airline to fly with, but now it seems they're only interested if you travel in one of the premium cabins (I'm speaking from experience). They should take a few tips from their hosts at Doha. The inflight entertainment was passable, if it wasn't for the constant interruptions for announcements - usually for trying to sell bits and pieces, or announcements between the crew.",Detractor

Flew from Munich to Toronto August 7th (over 8 hours) and the audio on our seats (3 middle seats in the very last row of the plane) did not work the entire flight. The screens also were periodically unresponsive. The lights could not be adjusted (had to be turned on manually since seat panel was not working at all). One flight attendant was lovely - very helpful and apologetic. Others clearly did not care. Indeed one kept insinuating that we were not being patient enough with the screen - she finally believed it was the system's failure when she tried it. Although the helpful attendant reset the system it did not work (until the plane completely shut off after landing - then the panel started working). Also when the person in front of me reclined his seat I could barely move. The helpful attendant gave us chocolates at the end of the flight which was very nice. It was an extremely uncomfortable and frustrating flight. We had paid the same amount as all the other folks who had working electronics.,Detractor

The 350 from HEL to KIX and back was a modern plane. I found the seats comfortable, though the tunnel for the legs is rather tight. The cabin crew on both flights were very pleasant, interacting with us in a very friendly fashion.

" Trans-Tasman flight on an A320 in economy. Rating 1 out of 10 for the nice cabin crew, the rest is worth 0/10. Seats are crammed so tightly that physically being able to sit is not obvious when you are 6ft3. Compared with Virgin Australia's 737 cabin, this is absolutely indecent. Then there's the service, if you can call it that. Don't forget that this is a full price airline, yet you don't get any food or snacks unless you pay extra. Want to check in your luggage? Pay extra. Want to use the IFE to watch a movie? Pay extra (!).

"  For a different experience, I decided to try out the new Premium Economy seats from Sydney to Tokyo via Singapore return. Between Sydney and Singapore I was in 35A and 31A to Tokyo, the same on the return. There is no overhead locker space for 35A as the partition wall blocks the cabin bins, while 31A has a single storage pocket on the bulkhead, stuffed with magazines etc, rather than the double pockets on the seat backs. I utilised the Book-The-Cook service on all legs, which were nice meals but nothing to really to separate them from regular inflight meals in terms of presentation. The seats were nice and comfortable with excellent width, recline and nice leg rest. The big bonus was the generous 13.3"" screen size which was clear and wonderful for watching the IFE. However the high wall mounted screens in row 31 meant that any movie I watched or personal photographs I wanted to view, they would be on view to the whole cabin. Whilst seated in 35A, I could clearly watch what was on the screen of the person in 31K for example. The staff were super attentive as they always are on an SQ flight. The only hassle was the Auxiliary Power Unit failing on the SYD-SIN leg which meant that there was no AC boarding the flight and a prolonged wait to depart the the flight at Changi Airport.",Promoter

Business class defined by stickers on the overhead baggage compartments and an empty middle seat, no monitors, no charging plugs, essentially a coach seat and not even a relatively good seat. Service was okay. Off to Vienna and boarding business class flight from Vienna to Washington DC. Checked in and when walking to gates stopped and was told to have my carry on weighed, too much weight at 12 kilos, have to check it. Have taken this bag all over the world and just got off an Austrian Airlines flight from Cairo and never had it questioned, went to excess baggage desk where we were clearly ignored by three staff at their desks until I asked if they were â€œopenâ€, after a grumpy look one of the staff told us to come forward, same conversation resulting in being refused the bag as a carry on and forced to check it at 12 kilos. Now one purchases a business class ticket for some amount of access and given I have carried this bag as a carry on in coach class and business class on many other airlines, ridiculous it was not allowed. Three points, 1) Weight for a reasonable sized and weight bag has nothing to do with carry on, the plane carries the same weight either in the overhead or in cargo and this one clearly fits in the overhead. 2) Coach seats are not business class and should not be offered as such. 3) Austrian Airlines will not be getting any of my future business and for all else I recommend avoiding them as much as possible. Cheap, rude, and not a business class airline product.",Detractor
" La Guardia to Dallas Ft Worth. Well, flying is already not pleasant, and I am not that frequent of a flyer, about 750k miles toward the million miler, usually about 25-30kk miles a year, just under their gold tier. Here is my beef. The new basic fares where you only get half a leg credit. My company has a policy they says all of the employees must purchase the lowest published fare. Well, for American, that means basic economy. Flying on American Airlines went from bad to worse. I live in Dallas and it is tough to fly any other airline that doesn't have a connecting flight. So I am stuck... a gold member they can't select a seat, gets half credit for every flight, and just flies in misery. American should change the policy on basic fares and allow gold members or higher to at least be able to select seats. At this point, I truly hate living in Dallas because I have to fly American and they completely suck with these new policies.",Detractor
Flights in December and January from London to Sydney via Beijing and back. We armed ourselves with our own food and laptops with extra batteries for movies etc. but we have found this to be one of the better flights we have ever been on. The attendants were polite and pleasant and all spoke English. The food was lovely and more than enough to fill you up with drinks at regular intervals. And if that wasn't enough you just press the button and ask for more. Toilets were as clean as you can expect from 300 people all using the same few loos. But after almost every one went in an attendant followed to clean up and replace loo roll etc. Space between seats was more than ample with at least 10 inches between your knees and the seat in front and even when the person in front put their seat back the seat wasn't right in your face. The entertainment was really good with over 40 films in English and games and music and even TV shows. Overall we can not fault this air line and we would most definitely recommend to others especially with it being over Â£3000 cheaper than other airlines!,Promoter
"Unfortunately AC has discontinued service of their full service line from YYC to LAS and there is no choice but to take Rouge. I have travelled in Premium Rouge once before and while I also disliked this Lufthansa short haul version of business class the economy service takes the cake! Seating is the most horrifying experience imaginable. I can honestly say I have never been on a plane where the seats were so uncomfortable and had such little room. I didn't even realize my legs had cramped up due to not being able to move until I tried to disembark the aircraft. I am 5'11 and my knees were wedged against the seat in front of me. I could not move my legs underneath the seat in front of me. I had used my frequent flyer comps to get a free meal from the BOB service. Even though I was the 6th person asked if I would like something from the BOB service my choice had ""just run out"". So I was stuck with a backup option. Additionally I told the FA that I had a meal included with my ticket and he did not believe me. I had to disrupt the people sitting next to me to reach my bag and dig out my boarding pass to show him the meal logo on it. I watched another FA scream at a passenger who desperately needed to use the lavatory because the seatbelt sign was on and ""Your seat is the safest place for you! Please sit down!"". The lack of an entertainment system is aggravating. I knew of this before leaving for my trip and am not willing to pay to download AC's not free entertainment app on my phone so I brought my small laptop to watch some movies. There was not enough room between the seats for me to open the lid on the laptop all the way. Of course all of this might be made tolerable for some people if the fares are discounted as you would expect on a self proclaimed ""discount airline"" Unfortunately I have been flying this route every 3 months for the last 4 years and can tell you the prices are exactly the same as what the full service AC has been charging. In other words a total scam. Never will I ever fly this airline again.",Detractor

 Melbourne to Brisbane. Check in was fine and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Dinner was very tasty and it was thoughtful to be offered an extra beer!

My first time with Air Canada. Refitted Boeing 777 with 3-4-3 layout. Fine as I had a seat empty next to me but it would be squashed when full. I had a 3-3-3 layout on the way home and was glad of the extra space. Flight was fine - slightly un-engaging and sloppy staff (one spilt water over me and didn't even notice). Food was awful though - low quality and very little of it. The Kosher meals served around me though looked huge and tasty! I'd say BA Economy is a better bet overall.,Passive
I paid almost 40% more for a premium economy for a flight from NY to Paris. Although you may have slightly more legroom the seats are not any more comfortable ie. you have two choices of seats where the back of the seat does not recline at all or where the armrest cannot be lifted therefore if the seat next to you is empty you can't stretch out. I truly felt deceived. As for the food service this is the worst. More specifically the food service includes giving you a menu of items to choose from example a sandwich or oatmeal. It's not your ordinary airline meal which includes a complete meal of a starter main course and desert. This was an international flight.,Detractor

"  Chicago to Stockholm. I flew to Stockholm from Chicago with my two children on July 02. At check-in we were given stand-by seats, and were told that we would be assigned seats at the gate, (which is something that has never happened in the 20+ years that I've flown with various airlines). I was concerned and asked if we would be seated together. The answer - ""I'm sure you will be."" We reached the gate and waited in another line (I wonder why SAS is stuck creating lines in the twenty-first century when there is no need for them) and were finally given our seats. I took a look at them, and noticed that one of my children was placed in another row. I asked to be seated next to both of my children, and was told that I had been given great seats, seats that I would normally have to have paid for. I said I didn't want better seats, I wanted to be seated next to my children. The person behind the desk said, ""I'll page you later."" He never did. On the plane I told the flight attendant that I really wanted and needed to be seated next to both of my children. Her answer - ""You have to pay extra if you want to be guaranteed a seat next to someone."" You read that right. In a SAS flight you have to pay extra to be seated next to your child. They appear to think it's acceptable for a child to spend 9 hours without being able to see or talk to his parent, a child who gets anxious during turbulence, and needs assistance with opening items during meals, and who wants to be close to his parent in an unfamiliar environment to feel safe. Luckily for us, a concerned passenger (who was appalled by the callous disregard of the flight attendant) switched seats with my son. Imagine that: a passenger has to do what the airline should have done without being asked. We provide the children's ages when booking the flight. The airline knows which passengers are children. This shouldn't be a problem. Another related problem was the quality of food. I was glad that I had packed food for my children, for it took the flight attendants nearly 2,5 hours to bring the evening meal and when it arrived, my children looked at the soggy, slimy vegetables and the overcooked meat and refused to eat it (so did I, btw). My advice to people is to think twice before booking a flight with SAS if they have children with them as nowhere do they mention that you have to pay to be seated next to your children, and as no sensible, feeling person would ever think that an airline would separate children from their parents it is something that parents can't prepare for. The eagerness of SAS to make money has reached a level of callousness that I believe is completely unmatched in the world of flying. As a native Swede, I find SAS to be an embarrassment and a disgrace. You can go after our money, but you can't go after our children to make that money. Shame on you.",Detractor

"  Helsinki to Singapore via Zurich. This review is mostly on the latest cancellation experience I had with Finnair, which I sent them emails repeatedly on this for 3 weeks however yet to receive a reply (not even a reply to say that my request is being processed/ investigated). So my flight from Helsinki to Singapore was cancelled and I was re-routed with Finnair and Singapore Airlines via Zurich. For the cancellation experience, the ground crew did not inform us on the cancelation until 2 hours after the planned departure time. The ground staff did not provide us information on the new booking arranged for the passengers. We were sent to an airport hotel and I had to call the airline hotline where I only knew about my new booking around 4 am (after calling repeatedly and being put on hold), to only get 1.5 hour sleep before my next flight. The airline also did not honour the confirmed business upgrade on the previous and I was returned back to Economy (this was a big issue since I had neck pain issues and I didn't bring my neck pillow). As for the HEL-ZRH Finnair, the seat pitch was good. The airline provided basic F&B. There was no inflight entertainment or WiFi. Cabin crew service was good but not extra ordinary. I would recommend the flight, however just pray that your flight is not cancelled. I was treated better on LH, SQ and TK during cancellations/ delays",Passive
SJU-PTY-RIO 12-20-2012. We have grown to expect the barely adequate Business seating as a price for the geographically convenient Panama City connection. On the flight to Rio my seat did not recline and our luggage did not arrive. It is worthy of note that our flight attendant acknowledged that the seat mechanism tended to failed frequently and promised to write up the difficulties but noted the airline tended to ignore them.

Shortly after, the pilot made an announcement and said that there was a problem with one of the engines and that we had to land as quickly as possible.

The beginning of this trip was great. My sister was getting married and the flights from DTW-Ft Lauderdale and Ft Lauderdale - Punta Cana were just fine. A week later when we were getting ready to head home we were forced to wait for over five hours in the airport only to learn that Spirit was not flying us home at this time. My newlywed sister was spilt from her new husband because they could get him on a flight out and told him if he didn't take it then he couldn't leave the country. After this Spirit said we would be flying out the next day but the night when we got the flight information my family of 8 and I were not on the list. After trying for hours to get ahold of customer service we were told the earliest they could get us home was Saturday and that was not a promise! We were left stranded in another country with no idea how to get home or how to talk any Spanish in order to figure out how to get home. As a family we had to buy tickets from a different airline to get home. Spirit would not transfer us to a different airline. All I can say is awful!,Detractor

I am here to complain about the level of service that they gave to try to get rebooked. Once someone's flight is cancelled, there should be appropriate staff to handle the volume. Every representative was rude, as if it is my fault my flight was cancelled. We were all treated like a nuisance. After going through customs, I was halfway directed to the customer service line. It was downstairs, so I tried to use the escalator across the way to go down with my huge international bag. An agent screamed at us that we could use the escalator right in front of us, to not use that one and clog it up. Well we told her the escalator is broken and we can't use it. She didn't care. For some reason we could not use use the escalator that everyone else 50m away was using. I am 7 months pregnant and carried my huge bag down those stairs. I unfortunately pulled a muscle in my stomach, I should have used it anyway but I didn't. She still did not care. We then found the line. 100s of people were in it with two agents to help. We waited for over 4 hours. I got sick from not eating or drinking and being pregnant, but if I got out of line, I would have to start over. 30 minutes later the two agents tell us ""well we are off now, you guys have to call. Bye."" They left us. A man yelled ""I've been on hold with them for an hour and a half already!"" Most of us in tears from being there so long. I was there 4.5 hours, I don't know how long the people in the front were there. Unfortunately my phone was stolen in Spain, so I had no way to call. Simply stuck with no way to rebook.

9th Feb TK70. We purchased our tickets from London to Istanbul and then from Istanbul on to Hong Kong almost as soon as they were released 11 months before we were due to travel. Perhaps because we booked through an online travel agent we were not offered seat selection at that point. We didn't worry too much because we assumed that the airlines default position would be to sit a couple together and after all we had booked very early. This turned out to be a naive assumption! When we attempted to check in online which was more than 36 hours before the Istanbul to Hong Kong flight the only seats available were at opposite ends of the cabin. Our pleas to the Turkish airlines office in London the check in desk at Gatwick and the transfer desk at Istanbul were all to no avail.

HNL- YVC 15-12-14. We had been advised that our return flight was to be with AC Rouge. Having read a number of negative items concerning Rouge we were not expecting anything different. However we went with an open mind. The crew were professional and gave good service considering that it was a red eye flight. Departure and arrival were both timely. We sat in preferred seating which was much better than the regular economy seating. The seats were comfortable however did not recline too much. From a safety perspective I was unable to hear some of the announcements. There was no track lighting in the aisles. The overhead directional lighting did not work. Overall the aircraft 767-300 was clean. The toilets were cleaner than other AC flights that I have taken. The food for purchase was good however way overpriced. The funky uniforms of the flight attendants could be more professional. Ditch the hats. This is considered a no frills concept. They didn't miss the mark in that statement. The cost however is greater than mainline AC. I downloaded the AC Rouge APP and viewed some of the movies etc. They could do better as a lot of the downloads were old. For example I love Lucy Auntie Maime etc. Not worth purchasing the $10.00 iPad usage. Would I fly AC Rouge again? Firstly we fly every year to Hawaii.

"Austrian has never really been on my radar but after my flight from Vienna to New York, I have to say I'm very impressed.

I took the individual seat by the window which is very comfortable, for it has table space on both the left and right side of the seat. When converted to a fully-flat bed it's very comfortable - although perhaps a little bit on the narrow side. The IFE was also interesting, with a remote touch sensor to control the cursor on the screen. You could also use the touch screen. It was a simple system but perhaps that's why it worked so well. The catering was superb. Wow! They have an onboard chef that prepares (or warms) fresh, healthy meals. The antipasti and desserts were brought to you on a trolley, where you could make your choices. The rigatoni pasta that I had for my main dish was delicious. The best surprise was yet to come though. The coffee menu! With ten options I was completely spoiled.

No seats available on arrival, cooked meal inedible and the lounge was not exclusive to BA and was clearly being used by all and sundry who paid a few quid for the use of a lounge. The tables were also filthy.",Detractor

" Houston to Jakarta via Taipei. This trip makes my 16th trip on Eva Air, (Houston/Taipei/Jakarta/Taipei/Houston in the last year and a half. This being my 4th trip to Indonesia, I have become more astute in looking at the available airlines to Jakarta from Houston. While the selection is not huge there are enough to offer some level of competition. The comment is due to the fact that I have been able to find cheaper air fare to Jakarta for this trip, I still opted to fly on Eva Air because I know I will be first class service in Economy. I cannot say enough about the level of excellent service in this airline. The seats, the entertainment selection and the food in economy are just tops. The service from the flight attendants, it is just above and beyond any US airline. The flight to Taipei was on a 777-300 and I selected seat 64G, it was an aisle seat very close to the rear bathroom and allowed me to move about the cabin without having to bother anyone. The seat was comfortable with ample leg room and enough seat recline for me to sleep comfortably for several hours. I also prepaid for the WIFI and was able to use my social media accounts without issue. I was not able to find a power outlet under the seat but the entertainment screen had outlets for power for my iphone and it was charged the entired trip. This was another excellent experience in Eva Air to Asia !!",Promoter
LIM-MEX-LIM Business Class (Clase Premiere) in April was a perfect example on how Aeromexico has come to represent an inconsistent product. Plane is an oldish 737 without personal IFE but it was just fine in both legs. Seat Ok and amenity kit that Aeromexico now handles only on overnight flight with some space for improvement even though it was delivered with a really nice IPAD case. As far as service is concerned a huge difference between the MEX-LIM and the LIM-MEX leg. On the first leg it was outstanding with a professional warm and polite flight attendant. Good food and good selection of drinks. On the way back flights attendants did not even bother to greet passengers and performed their job mechanically and without interest. What a difference! What a lack of consistency in the product delivered by Aeromexico. A 3/10 would be a perfect grade to describe this last experience.,Passive

" A flight to forget. From Milan to Miami. Unfortunately, American Airlines still using old aircraft on the routes between the US and Milan. My aircraft was not only old and in not good conditions, with an old-fashioned IFE system (overhead TV, no power), but it also had old and ruined seats. My seat was tilted outwards and it was not possible to change seats because the plane was full. The flight staff was quite good, but not always attentive to passenger needs as in others airlines. Poor quality food and beverage compared to those usually offered on transoceanic flights by European or Middle Eastern and Asian airlines. By the end, that 12h flight was an experience to forget, also because the ticket price was definitely overpriced compared to the services that AA was offering",Detractor

Between Heathrow and Lima via Dallas and LAX one of our bags went missing, due to American Airlines transferring us to another airline.

Considering it is more so a budget type of airline the service is quite on par to their prices. The customer service is courteous and friendly. The airline has started to outfit their planes with new seats and better inflight entertainment screens. The food service amounts to chips and cookies, but again, it's a budget airline so they serve food accordingly. Recently they have started to charge for baggage but if you book online they do offer a better rate than most other airlines that charge.

" Flew short haul business class with British Airways, Manchester - Gothenburg via London Heathrow. It's a diffcult one to review, some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable. We used points to travel, so what we paid was fine, though would never pay a full BA business short haul fee. We have family in Sweden so took 70kgs (gifts etc) of luggage with us for our four night trip. Check-in was fine both ends, all fights on-time (just about) and no luggage issues, a positive. The staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns. We had a mixture of fortunes with the catering MAN-LHR, nice cold meat platter (30 min flight). LHR-GOT three dried up finger sandwiches, no alternative offered, were told could not take from the M&S menu in economy either. One reason for this, because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system. I was told to change my profile details on BA site - once home I looked it clearly says meal options - none, i.e. no special menu (confusing to say the least). Thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights. We were told in economy you had to purchase everything, even water, however if in an emergency tap water could be provided - so much for a full-service airline! Any newspapers also gone from business class. On LHR-GOT route there was no divide put up between business and economy, so a 'free for all' to the front toilet. Leg room not great, even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat (more than 24h) in advance (Â£21 for the frist row and Â£18 for the rest), which is ridiculous if you had paid Â£400 return. Lounges OK - preferred MAN to LHR (which is busy and looking worn already). The down-scaling of BA and the mix of pretending to be a full-service airline, but having budget airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on. The FAs were a saving grace, though rest assured, they are not happy. We'll use up our existing points, though definiately not our airline of choice.",Detractor

For the first part of the trip we sat at the gate at LA, but eventually pushed back and sat out on the tarmac somewhere until we got clearance from San Francisco. Understandably some passengers were upset because of possible missed connections at SFO, but weather is what it is, and an airline can't help that. Some opted to disembark before we pushed back from the terminal. The pilot was very courteous and apologetic. You could tell he cared as he tried to work whatever magic he could to get us out as early as possible. He was even apologetic over the the way some of the ground crew was apparently dealing with customer concerns which he felt wasn't totally what it should have been. Some things he apparently overheard and apologized for. The cabin crew onboard the flight was pleasant as well (though I think it would have been cool if they had offered water, or peanuts or something as we sat waiting. Since we really didn't know how long it was going to be.) Still I felt the flight and cabin crew handled it as well as they could.

"â Unverified | New York to Seoul via Shanghai. My experience flying with China Eastern was not a great one, particularly because of the small seats and the lack of decent entertainment to choose from. My shoulders were nearly in the seats next to me and it was a battle for the armrest for the 14 and 16 hour flights. The seats seemed very firm and weren't comfortable to rest in at all. It didn't help that the Chinese woman next to me kept spitting into a cup, making the loudest noises ever to do so. Aside from the small seats in Economy, the movie selection was not great by any means. I was able to choose from a couple that I found interesting, but I ran out of viable options pretty quickly thereafter. Lastly, I had purchased my tickets 5 months before the trip actually took place and had chosen aisle seats for every flight. On my way to New York, I was given my aisle seats. But on the way back, I was sat in a middle row seat, in the middle of the plane, for both legs of the trip. I was not at all thrilled. It didn't help that I became ill on the flight and was not able to freely walk around whenever I pleased. Overall, if it were up to me, I would never fly with China Eastern again.

SFO-INC on a B777-300ER. The legroom was ok nothing exceptional. The cabin and toilets were kept clean throughout the duration of the flight. The krisworld IFE was superb with a wide range of movies music and games. The 2 meals were delicious and probably the best I have tasted in the air. The cabin crew as always were exceptional serving the drinks frequently to keep us well hydrated. Will recommend this airline.,Promoter
Airbus 321 from Amman Jordan to London. Flight on time. Full plane. Very uncomfortable seats I am tall no leg room knees against the seat in front for the flight of over 5 hrs. This is the wrong plane for this trip-narrow single aisle only 2 toilets for all 180 passengers - more like a bucket and spade flight. Food very moderate salad starter of 3 leaves and an uncut chunk of cucumber main course of chicken and potato was tepid not hot at all. Cabin crew spent a lot of the time chatting in the galley at the back of the plane although the food service was quick. Upgraded on the outward trip-what a difference! BA needs to sort the plane choice out-this flight is often completely full. Economy was very poor.,Detractor

We flew from UAE to Turkey by another discount airline with our carry on luggage. Returning we flew FlyDubai. We shopped and accumulated check-in luggage - what a mistake. We tried to purchase the credit for this online and couldn't. Getting to the airport we were prepared to pay for this extra luggage. Then we learned what the 7kg rule is. They weighed my purse carry on luggage and this extra checked in luggage and then deducted the 7kg off to calculate my total cost for checked in luggage. The other airline didn't even look at my carry on luggage more less than weighed it. At a cost of 10Euros a kg this was absurd and a costly lesson flying FlyDubai. It didn't help that the staff behind the desk couldn't explain the situation.,Detractor

"Helsinki to Melbourne via Doha. Inaugural flight from Helsinki, the A350 was amazing. The business class seats looked a lot better than the ones on the Boeing 777-300. (Really wish I had taken up the business class email upgrade offer). The cabin felt great and the entertainment system was excellent with no lag at all with swiping and so on. The camera options were great too. Food was excellent, gin tonic with ice even, wine and cognac and coffee. Downside was the repetitive adverts and the safety video revolving around Barcelona and football which quickly got very annoying. I pre-selected vegetarian meal on both flights but was only served it on the 2nd leg, the normal food being served looked much better to be honest. Hotel stopover was good, hotel could maybe be a little closer to airport and center of Doha. Only complaints from 2nd leg was that mine and neighbouring person had something stuck in the audio jacks so could not use headphones and entertainment system was old and lagging.",Promoter

"â Unverified | Air France from Paris CDG to New York JFK, Business Class , A380-800, seat 67A This is a mammoth jet and business class seats are in the old side by side style (i.e. no privacy). It's kind of awkward sleeping next to a stranger and climbing over to get up. Still, the set up is quite roomy. If you travel with all sorts of small carry-ons, as I do, get a window seat which has it's own storage bin next to it. The food was almost uniformly very good. Foie gras, salmon tartareâ€¦ Unfortunately, the duck was grossly overcooked and swam, very unattractively, in a sea of orange something (it actually tasted good, but was about as appetizing as baby food).

I was surprised that some passengers were given 3-4 small bottles of wine each. Food was nice. Disembarking was quick. Cabin staff were a bit abrupt and showed annoyance with some passengers. What puzzled me was how people ignored warnings about mobile phone use and kept using them during takeoff and landing. No communication from the cockpit and a brief announcement by cabin staff just saying thank you for flying with this airline. In the safety briefing they left it up to the video which did not show me where the nearest exit was.,Detractor

"Horrible experience. Left the gate in Norfolk late. Waited on the taxiway for 20 minutes prior to takeoff, allegedly due to a stoppage at Laguardia, the connecting city. One bathroom on the plane, which was dirty. Arrived at Laguardia a tad late, but not so late as to miss the connection. Then we sat on the taxiway at Laguardia for an hour because our gate was occupied, and missed our connection to Halifax. Now stuck in Laguardia from 11:30 am until 6:10 pm, arriving Nova Scotia at 9:30 pm. Half a day of vacation blown. Laguardia has nothing to do inside the airport. Delta refuses to comp anything. This was not a weather delay. We are traveling with a couple who are Delta premium members. They went to the customer service desk in the private Skyclub to try to get something in the way of a comp. No satisfaction. They asked for a supervisor, who refused to even come to the service desk. Delta doesn't give a damn about customer service.",Detractor

" Bangkok to London via Abu Dhabi. Uncomfortable seat pads, rude/moody staff and entertainment system isn't active until about 30 mins after take off and was switched off 45 minutes before landing. I asked cabin crew why, just said its policy and walked off - this airline has no interest in customers. Entertainment system is good otherwise, but this crazy policy compared with competitors who leave it on while on the ground is bizarre. As others have said they have recently introduced charges for seat reservations which have been applied irrespective of when the booking was made - if it's free on booking, it should be remain free! And the policy for exit rows is ludicrous - something like Â£140 per seat per segment, so as most people connect through AUH that would be Â£560 each for a return trip!! For our family of 4 that would he Â£2,200. This is a 3 star airline at best, will not be using ever again.",Detractor

"  On August 16th I would fly KLM Malaga to Amsterdam. In the morning when I woke up, both the mail and text came in. The flight has been canceled. Further information follows. Still confident that it would be good. A few hours ago, the news came that the flight we were in was now the next day. And then with a stopover. We would arrive at our destination more than 24 hours later. I could not afford this delay, considering work-related matters. Then you call. Wait for 40 minutes and you will not be helped. Eventually via Facebook Messenger had contact. But beyond that this was the best possible option and a referral to the complaint form, we did not arrive. Additional hotel accommodation was not offered. So I had to book myself. We are not informed about any refund or compensation. I have because I could not afford this delay to book a ticket with another company of â‚¬ 400! While waiting at the airport, KLM had several flights to Amsterdam. Apparently, with a flight that goes beyond 24 hours later than planned, you can arrange everything yourself, at least when you fly with KLM. An annoying end of a vacation. Not on the same flight as my partner back. And huge costs due to cancellation. I am definitely going to file a claim.",Detractor

  Flew from Budapest to London Gatwick. We consciously took hand luggage to minimise time at the airport so that we could get our connecting train on the return journey (as a result of waiting for our luggage we missed our train which had a knock on effect to the rest of our 6 hour journey). On boarding the plane (late and chaotic process) we were told by cabin staff that our bags would have to go in the hold because other people who boarded before us had too many bags. What's the point of having rules about hand luggage if no one has to follow them? The cabin staff blamed the airport check in staff and shrugged as much to say 'I don't care'. Some members of staff were brusque to the point of being rude and when ordering food (most of which they didn't have!) the air hostess was dealing with several customers at the same time and having several different conversations - very rude.

They just informed us today that our flights have been changed so that we will be now leaving at 9pm getting to the hotel around 3am. We don't get out hotel room until May 6th, at 3pm the next day. So what exactly are we supposed to do at the hotel in the early morning with no room to check into? I have been on many all inclusive trips and I understands that flights do change, but I have never before arrived at hotel 12 hours before being able to check in, in the middle of the night. We called Sunwing to complain and their response was that they changed the flight for ""business reasons"" and there is nothing they can do for us, we can cancel and reschedule the vacation (not an option, we are meeting friends there and have had planned this trip for months). We asked about getting a room when we get there and they said sure if you want to pay the hotel and extra $150 to book the room for that night. After this experience and the lack of willingness to accommodate for the inconvenience, we will definitely never be flying with Sunwing again.",Detractor
LHR-KEF-BOS JFK-KEF-LHR Saga Class. Punctual flights with older aircraft (Boeing 757) but well maintained inside. On demand IFE with a wide choice of entertainment. Polite and willing flight attendants. And plenty of good food and drink. The dinner back from JFK (Icelandic lamb) was one of the better in flight meals I've had and the rest were more than passable. Saga Class is an 'old fashioned' business class. There's no flat bed but a nice wide leather seat. I chose Icelandair as our work travel budget is currently constrained and a fully changeable and refundable ticket was two thirds the price of a non changeable business class ticket on other carriers. My only niggle and it's small but ought to be addressed is that some of the overhead bins in Saga Class were used for storage of blankets and crew bags. Premium passengers should not be fighting for room in the overheads bins. But overall I'm well satisfied and will use again.,Promoter
" Sydney to Los Angeles. We were on a group tour to Australia via Qantas. We were advised by the tour company that Qantas would not provide a seat selection until we checked in at the airline. Qantas then would not allow us to be seated together claiming since it was a tour group booking that all members would be assigned seats in a certain area and It was our responsibility to make arrangements with other members of the group after we boarded. We later learned that several members of our group were assigned seats with their spouses and spread throughout the aircraft, We also noticed there were several unoccupied seats which could have been utilized to have spouses sit together. Regardless if I am with a group or not, I should be able to sit with my spouse. That is not a good policy to split spouses, especially on a long, long, trip.

"  I recently made a round trip Montreal to Mexico City. My passport showed two last-names and my plane ticket showed only one last name. For this reason, Aeromexico made such a big fuss and made me buy a new plane ticket. It seems that adding only one last name to the plane ticket was extremely difficult for them since they refused to understand that all they had to do was a minor modification and not a change in the name on the plane ticket. Unlike many other airlines which are supportive and helpful in situations like these, their staff were extremely impolite, and very unprofessional too. All they want is rip you off and get more money from you. Also, for unknown reasons, I received e-mails from them in which they confirmed two reservations, that I never requested, with different return dates, what an awful mix-up, not only are they rude but also incompetent.

"The flight originated in Montreal P.E. Trudeau Airport and Swiss staff there were kind and willing to help. Boarding went smoothly and the plane departed on time. The cabin was very clean, elegant and felt comfortable. The seats had very decent legroom, had tolerable width and a pretty good IFE system. There was a good selection of movies, shows and music (although the user-interface was very bland). Seat recline was also decent and the seats themselves were very comfortable when I was seated properly. One downside was that there were no power outlets on any of the seats, only a USB port which was not working. Shortly after takeoff, we were served a snack (pretzels) and a drink of our choice, with a main meal followed shortly after and breakfast before arrival at Zurich. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful and spoke in various other languages aside from English, German and French. The flight was smooth, relaxing and quiet. Swiss International Airlines has also done a wonderful job in their product branding and the attention to detail was exquisite, with things such as full metal cutlery and the complementary Swiss chocolate that's given out before arrival.

" We travelled from London to Manila via Abu Dhabi a few days before Christmas with a 1.5 hour stopover in Abu Dhabi. The flight from London was delayed by 1 hour which is no big deal. During the flight as we approached Abu Dhabi, we ended up circling due to bad weather. On asking the flight staff, no one was able to advise what the next steps were. We eventually landed at Abu Dhabi and were advised to go to the Transfer Desk. They told us our plane was still there and to go to the gate. We go to the gate only to be told our seats had been given away and we had been offloaded. We questioned why and they were rude in their response and told us to go to the transfer desk. Someone 'helped' us by walking us to the transfer desk. All we wanted to know was when our next flight would be, which we only found out after queuing behind a 100 people and found out that it was in 7 hours. At no point was any rest place or accomodation advised or given and we had to argue in getting food vouchers rather than being offered them. We managed to see through the next 7 hours only to be confronted with more difficulty. We queued for our connecting flight only to be told we need to check in our hand carry. We insisted we were carrying medicine which we needed to keep, at which point the attendant shouted and threatened to deboard us from the plane if we didn't comply. After much stress managed to eventually get on to the flight. We arrived in MNL and waited for 2 hours in baggage only to find out 2 out of 3 of our checked in suitcases did not make it. As a result we were unable to give gifts and presents to our relatives for Christmas plus our clothes and personal effects were missing. On questioning where are luggage was, there was no explanation and we had to wait 24hrs before they could track our baggage. Etihad eventually got our luggage to us 3 days later although frustratingly no arrangement was made to drop it. They decided to call at 3am and demanded they drop it, irrespective of how inconvenient this was. We decided to rebook our return as the issues and delays stopped us from doing some important things. We called Etihad only to be told it would cost the price of 1 full priced ticket for us both. We explained our challenges on our outward trip but no attempt was made to assist us with our return flight. When we asked them to proceed on the back of the conversation the previous day they opened our ticket (essentially cancelling our original return ticket) they went on to explain it would actually cost the price of 2 tickets rather than 1 which they had previously advised. We argued that we would have only been happy to pay for the price discussed the day before and was not happy they had misinformed us. They left us no choice but to buy new tickets at full price due to an error on their part without considering the previous problems. A lot of this could have been avoided if they looked at helping their customers. Issues happen but under no circumstances should the customers be dealt with such blatant disregard. We have been lucky enough to have travelled with Emirates, Cathay Pacific, KLM, and Singapore whose customer service has been great and unfortunately Etihad do not deserve to be held anywhere near the same level as them. Their lack of professionalism and customer care left so much to be desired. Their follow up and lack of attempt to assist frustrated and tired customers also was shocking for such a high profile company. Avoid using them!",Detractor

"  I had read a lot of the reviews about Air China and I was prepared for the worst for my flight from Bangkok to Washing Dulles via Beijing. For the most part nothing went wrong. The flight was delayed for one hour which actually suited me since I was running late to the airport. The flight to Beijing was full of empty seats so it was great to stretch out and really relax. There was no entertainment screens on the back of the seats but I didn't expect there to be for a 4-hour flight. I chose to eat some type of rice meal with veggies and cuts of ham (I think?) and it was nothing to write home about. I couldn't even finish it but you get what you pay for and for a $500 dollar ticket I wasn't complaining. When we got to Beijing the transition to our next flight was pretty simple since the layover was about 5 hours. When it was time to start boarding we squeezed into the bus and took a short ride over to the plane that'd be bringing us to Washing Dulles Int. This place did have entertainment on the back of each screens. I enjoyed the selection and it made the flight go quickly. As for the meals they offered chicken and rice and duck and rice. I chose the duck and it was ok, again nothing to brag about. If I had one thing I didn't like I'd say the time they made us wait to eat the second meal almost felt like torture. Next time I know to bring snacks along. The second meal I chose the beef and noodles and it was actually pretty good. The side was some dark chopped up root-type plant that had a flavor similar to seaweed (it was good). I didn't even bother to try and eat the last meal they handed out. It was a 3-set of sandwiches comprised of 1 tuna, 1 ham and 1 cheese. The turbulence never got too bad, the staff were constantly moving around to assist people and most importantly the flight got us from point A to B safe and sound.

"I was originally booked on a United Airlines flight from London to Boston, connecting through Washington Dulles, but this was cancelled because of the snow in DC. United rebooked me onto British Airways to complete the flight to Boston. Without a doubt, BA is one of the worst airlines I have flown on. Upon arriving at check in, I was told that I could only check in one bag, despite being allowed to take two bags on United. United said that I would be able to travel on an equivalent service with BA. The check in supervisor at Heathrow informed me that I would have to pay Â£65 to bring the bag. When I complained said ""it's not my problem"". I asked if they could call United to clarify the bag issue, but they refused, saying ""we don't even talk to United"" - in the end I didn't pay and will get it sent at a later date. The onboard service was very disappointing. The food was barely edible. The staff were loud and abrupt, providing the bare minimum service and yelling across the cabin at each other making the whole journey even more unpleasant. The inflight entertainment failed multiple times, and passengers started to be reseated because of the problem. The maximum volume was also too low so it was difficult to hear the movies over the cabin noise, and I am not hard of hearing.

The 2x4x3 configuration is the best layout I ever saw on a Boeing 777. Only downside is how the Y seat reclines, instead of your back reclining, it is your hips that slide forwards hence reducing your leg room.

Not much information or interactive ability available on English Language website (examples: no seat maps no online check in or even online viewing of reservations).

"  Spirit staff was the rudest in customer service that I have ever experienced. They make you feel like you are absolutely stranded with no remorse or apologies. We travel a lot and get that things happen, but when you feel like you have to fight to get home and pay extra money for a hotel room, rides to and from the airport, food, and toiletries that were lost by Spirit it is a horrible feeling. Pay the extra with other airlines because you will end up paying the exact same with what they charge for seats, carry-ons, checked bags, and food/drinks. They cancelled our flight due to weather when all other flights were on time from our location to our destination around the same time. They gave us minimal options to get home. A refund of $170, to fly home 24 hours later with 2 layovers, or to fly home 2 days later. The staff in Austin Airport for Spirit airlines was completely understaffed and not trained properly to handle the situation of a cancelled flight with the website and app not working.

Valerie in Spirit airlines Austin tried her best, but when we triple checked with her if our bags were going from Austin to our layover destination she stated yes. All of our luggage did not make it to our layover destination for 24 hours and they could not tell us where our luggage was or if it would end up at our final destination.

We called on our baggage the next day, which somehow got split up. At first the lady answers the phone and says I can't help you, you will get an update in 24-48 hours. She did not even try or ask for our claim number. Once we were harsh and made her look at our claim number she saw our bags arriving in LAX at 2pm and 9:40pm. Once we finally made it to LAX my luggage had arrived. We went to baggage claim to pick up my friends where the staff stated they did not know where our luggage was and it may be on a delayed flight. Many other angry guests were in baggage claim as well. I walked out and stood next to random Spirit carousel (not our flight), where I saw my friends bag going around. I could go on into more details about how horrible of an experience we had and how we never thought it could get worse and it just kept getting worse.

Hong Kong-Paris via Beijing. Price of this trip was excellent. The first 3 flights were on comfortable planes while the final leg from Beijing to HKG was on an old leased Air Macau plane which was rather cramped. Food isn't great but flights were on time and the air hostesses excellent. Movie selection is spartan but I took an ipod so didn't mind. The one curious policy is that Air China keep the fasten seat belt signs on throughout the flights. Would certainly fly again if price remains at least $HK 1500 lower than its competitors.,Promoter
"  London to Bangkok. I had stayed In the Singapore Airlines Heathrow lounge until final boarding was called and the gate was across from the lift exit. The person controlling passenger entry to the upper or lower deck entry looked at me and said 'economy?' I said 'first'. I was directed to the right hand aisle and after sorting myself out was offered a drink. Then a person introduced herself as a flight manager and said to ask her about anything. Flight took ages from gate to take off as Heathrow was full. Seat is wide and comfortable but I could always see middle seat passenger whilst seat was in sitting position. Had more Champagne after takeoff with a funny bit of chicken first, followed by a Thai northern sausage, which was hot, but I did not like the cooked egg dish or nuts. The caviar is now served in a controlled portion screw top bottle with plated garnitures and vodka has to be requested. I chose a Thai selection for main course which was extensive. Duck in red curry was not very succulent as I don't think that reheating duck can turn out very well, unless as Confit. Dried shrimp was fiercely hot. Long cooked soft pork was soft. I did not need anything else but the cheese looked nothing special. Red wine was an improvement on anything offered in Thai that I have ever had. Sleeping was not so good. Seat length and width are good. But the seat is hard and segmented, the seat cover and blanket are of poor quality and they could purchase United Polaris pillows rather than the uncomfortable two currently on offer. I was in 1K and the lighting from the front staircase was intrusive. By the way, the bar area at the front of the plane is disused, apart from providing somewhere to sit whilst your bed is being made up. Overall not really worth paying for over Business class product.",Passive
OS456/25 LHR-VIE-BKK and OS 26/451 BKK-VIE-LHR. New Business class seats allow a decent sleep IFE selection is not great. BKK-VIE the headsets were collected in after the arrival video was shown about an hour prior to landing then the video restarted so I missed the end of the film I was watching. Second meal service (breakfast) has small portion sizes flew this airline and class recently on the NRT route and vastly better service and more professional crew. Short connection times at VIE make this a fast route. Worst experience is the seating on OS25. Premium Miles & More customers are usually reserved seats in rows 1 and 3. This works fine except when the airline uses row 2 for families with small children or upgrades. Sleep was made difficult on OS25 by shouting at their children to control them and shouting at each other audible across 2 aisles. No re-seating available as this flight always seems to be full or over-sold. Washrooms could do with a refit on all Austrian aircraft.,Passive
Flight 835 MCO-YYZ. Flew on them a few months back and I must say I was not impressed. Reading all the other reviews I assume that all the good ones were written by people shorter than 5'5. With its cool new cabin layout and the stylish cabin attendant uniforms it could easily be someone's favorite airline but with the drastic decrease in leg room I cant see myself flying them again. There was so little leg room I had to sit in the bathroom for the last hour of the flight. I am never flying them again not until Rouge goes belly up and the regular Air Canada flights start coming back to the Bahamas.,Detractor
"  I was told on the Saturday that my hand luggage was fine (the right size) by BA staff at Geneva airport - it was physically inspected. Then, on Monday, I was ordered to pay Â£65 (83 Francs). Staff at the airport were insanely rude (to be honest, the supervisor particularly). Their customer service is also awful. It's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like Qatar. When filing a complaint, they did not respond for 3 weeks. They only responded when I chased them up, said waiting time is actually 4 weeks. Can you believe that? The explanation was their IT system failed in May 2017, an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved.",Detractor
I have flown with Royal Air Maroc many times it's a very good airline and it has a reputation I can't seem to find when I'm on-board their aircrafts. Staff are very good and great with customer service. I was flying from London-Tangier and one man decided to smoke in the toilets the staff took this as a serious problem and treated him fairly and when we landed in Tangier he was arrested it's good to see action taken. They served lunch which I always love I had the chicken with rice and potatoes very tasty. Royal Air Maroc is a standard airline with great seats and very friendly staff their English is superb so no communication problems will occur on-board. It was very clean I called a member of staff 6 times during the 3 hr flight she was very happy serving me all the time.,Promoter
"We flew BA Gatwick to Grenada - first time with BA and only due to dates having been dedicated Virgin customers. We upgraded to ""Premium Economy"" and apart from the extra leg room (ideal for hubby but no odds to me at 5'3""). No benefit and total waste of money at almost double cost of upgrading with Virgin! Service was not great and food was awful - ""welcome on board"" drink in Premium Economy was orange juice in round plastic carton. Virgin offers orange juice or champagne in a glass. No idea what food was on offer as no menu provided and just a disgruntled ""chicken or beef"" response when asked stewardess. Old and tatty plane very small TVs. First and last time flying with BA - will change dates of holiday in future to ensure Virgin flight. Overall this over-priced upgrade didn't even compare with Virgin's economy service.

  My review isn't about my Dublin to Stuttgart flight last week but about my experience on my return yesterday dealing with Aer Lingus Representatives in Stuttgart airport. Time of flight 16.10 EI0359. I arrived at gate 337 at 15.45. I was delayed going thru security as there was a very big crowd and the lines were going very slowly. I had a tub of hair conditioner and my bag was checked and tube removed. After I was refused entry I was told by german staff to â€˜go down and out' I was asking to go to customer services.  Eventually one staff member showed me an exit and I went down to customer service.  They just said gate was closed. Later I rang Aer Lingus and explained my story to a pleasant staff member. She asked me if they said anything about going on standby which they didn't. They didn't make any effort to make any other arrangements or explain about the extra â‚¬75 to book another flight which is posted on your website. I feel the experience was shocking and customer service was atrocious.  I then had to book another Aer Lingus flight costing â‚¬158 to get home next when it should have only cost â‚¬75. How was I supposed to know if there is no one willing of able to tell me. I feel that I got a raw deal and no help. If you are operating flights to/from there you should have some decent representative who can advise when a mini crises presents. Up until this my experiences have been good with Aer Lingus.,Detractor
" Toronto to Naples via Frankfurt. I flew with Lufthansa with my husband and two small children (nearly 2 years old, and 4 years old). Check-in was fast and the staff were wonderful. About an hour into our flight the pilot announced that there was a problem with the plane and we had to turn around. We arrived back in Toronto and were kept on the plane, there was some confusion as to whether we would be flying out that evening or being rebooked the following day. Through the entire ordeal the stewardesses were fantastic and patient as people were frustrated. They adjusted the problem with the plane and it was decided we would fly out, however, due to the delay many of us missed our connecting flights. When we arrived in Frankfurt we were rescheduled onto another flight to Munich, and then we would fly from Munich to Napoli. They offered us a 40â‚¬ voucher for lunch at the airport. My children by the end were impatient and tired and all of the staff we encountered were helpful and patient. The children were given toys (my eldest was given Lego on one flight) and colouring books to entertain them throughout the flights. All of the planes were clean and modern. The only downside is children under 2 are not given meals.",Promoter

Food on board is of very good quality and healthy with flight attendants particularly pleasant. Less delays and less canceled flights are something to note too.

Customer service was helpful at the busy airport and we checked our bag with ease. We printed out our passes at home (spirit sends an email to help with this). We checked our guitar that arrived there and home in great shape. Will use this airline again.

" Las Vegas to Dallas. If I could give them negative points, I would. I have flown Spirit a couple of times just because of the price of the bare fare. However, every time I fly them, I get treated like trash. First of all, If you fly them, you have to pay for bags online or you will have to pay the ridiculous $60 fee per bag. Since they are a ULCC, you have to pay for drinks and snacks. The crew on my flight ( NK208 January 5,2019) treated me specifically, like trash for no reason while they were nice to other passengers.The ground staff at Las Vegas were friendly though. The seat was extremely dirty and had stains and scratches all over it. Which means that their cleaning crews don't do there jobs correctly. The seat itself was uncomfortable and doesn't not recline. When we landed at DFW, The ground staff told us the bag claim was E31 (as the F/A s said when we landed) but the monitor did not display that. The monitor at E32 did but the staff told us that it was at E31. After 20 minutes of waiting, We realized that they had 3 flights on the same belt (E32) when there were 4 others open. Then our bags showed up at E32, when they said it was E31. So 4 flight were on the same bag Belt. Overall, Spirit is the most trashy Airline in the U.S. and even if their base fare is â€œcheapâ€, after all the addons, it ends up being the same price as the legacy carries. Do yourself a favor and never fly with them.",Detractor

The problems started in Dallas, where after boarding, we had to wait in an old Boeing 777-200 for 1.5 hours, for the luggage to be unloaded and redistributed so that the weight of the aircraft to be ideal. After take-off, the IFE started to work, but you couldn't just play the movie you wanted, you could either jump in the middle of it, or wait about 15 minutes until it will start again. As it wasn't enough, this system went out of power doing the middle of the movie, the crew had no idea and after 30 minutes it came back to life. Of course, I had to watch a movie 3 times from the beginning as you couldn't fast forward or anything. The food was generally bad, as was the wine they gave us. Just a small blanket and a pillow, no other things for the night. The crew didn't give much of an interest. I guess the old entertainment system was just because it was a night flight (scheduled departure 22:10) and not many people use it. That is why I rate it as an average experience.

I incurred over $400 in out of pocket expenses to catch up with my ship at its next port. Moreover I purchased Saga Class tickets (business class). The seats were wide with plenty of leg room but did not recline very far. Our evening meal consisted of a sandwich our breakfast was a cup of coffee and a granola bar. The inflight entertainment system was inoperable. Service was fine with lots of apologies but never again will I fly Icelandair.,Detractor

  Manchester to Toronto via Brussels. Zero respect for the passenger. Lost both of our suitcases one for six days and the other until the day before our return. Spend 4 hours trying to record the loss of our luggage as 40 other people had not got theirs either. Cost me 50 CAD for the parking Â£75 in phone calls to try and trace the baggage as well as every morning wasted attempting to call either Toronto or Brussels to see if the baggage had been found only to be told two days before I returned that the baggage had not left Brussels. I have lost both of those cost as they do not have to pay incidentals even though the cost was incurred due to the fact that they had lost our luggage. The response from the airline is almost as if they are immune to all that may cost you due to their incompetence. Food was distinctly average even though the staff were very pleasant on board. there truly is nothing good about this outfit other than that.,Detractor
CX255 18th Sep 2013 HKG-LHR. The seat was quite comfortable but the personal display looked a little bit cheap. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. The meals were very good for in-flight meals. As in all 747s the seat was a bit narrower than the 777 seats. Ground crew was also very helpful offering to print my boarding pass (I had the e-pass on my phone).,Promoter
"  London Heathrow to Lima. After my rave review of Norwegian to California, I find myself back on British Airways on my regular trip to South America. No delays on departure and well ordered boarding, but despite the smiles, British Airways staff just can't quite reach out to passengers as was the Norwegian experience. Tired, grey Boeing 777 interior doesn't help either. Okay the rudiments of a service are there but come on, who decided no alcoholic drinks served with dinner or replace the afternoon tea with a box of sickly snacks and half a tumbler of water, to later serve quite a tasty lunch with just coffee or tea ? Pokey TV screen but okay IFE programme choice. I suppose this is the best we can expect but with so called low cost airlines doing so much better, the main carriers deserve to lose ground.",Passive

Service best comparable to the one you get with KLM.",Passive
I've had at least eight Germanwings flights in the last two years. One thing I don't see in other reviews is the fact Germanwings will charge 7 Euro/kilo for anything over 20 kilos (44 lbs) on checked bags. This can be an unpleasant surprise. Naturally they refuse to pay you the same rate for underweight bags. In the last two years they have also occasionally weighed carry on bags with a limit of 10 kilo. Snacks and drinks are all an extra charge.,Passive
Luton to Budapest. Aware of the draconian application of the carry on dimensions I measured mine and it complied. Boarding was announced only to be followed by ground agents walking the line and selecting many to fit their bags into the 'box'. I made it with a firm boot but was disgusted to witness an elderly lady failing by a minimum margin. We all helped with plastic bags and someone found a bin liner. Result - lady lost her bag but the PR for Wizz was appalling. Note that they have now changed their baggage policy which is full of anomalies with different dimensions apparently qualifying as 'free' as well as a myriad of complications. Be warned- this is a money making scam. Good news is that I have booked another flight to Budapest with easyjet and it was cheaper!,Detractor

"  Landed at Newark on UA18 from Milanâ€“Malpensa, I had to board my connecting flight to Orlando UA730 scheduled for 2.55 pm. Despite an early landing in Milan, due to the lenghty custom procedures and the unavailability of the United Airlines personnel to assist me in expediting the process, despite my desperate running through the airport, I reached the gate too late for boarding. I had to take the later flight at 3.55. I missed a meeting in Orlando. The staff at the UA customer service desk were very unpleasant and were not be co-operative at all. I have to add that the 8.5 hour flight from MXP to Newark was also very unconfortable with poor quality food and noisy company. I complained to customer service and received a free ticket for a future flight with United for the value of 150 US Dollars. However, 6 days later, when on my way back to Italy from Florida I asked the UA personnel at MCO-Orlando to upgrade my ticket from Newark to Milano Malpensa UA19 to a business class ticket. The attendant at the counter told me that there were seats available, but an upgrade for my ticket was not available nor could I use the free ticket United gave me. If I wished to fly business class, I had to buy a new ticket. On my return flight (UA19) to Milan MXP from Newark on May 26, 2016 I again tried without success to get a more comfortable seat than the one assigned 45C (the very last seat on the rear right next to the lavatory). However, the cabin was full and the overbooking issue caused a delay in the departure. Despite my express request not to be seated near children or babies, I had a newborn sitting a couple of rows ahead of me. Luckily, he did not scream at all during the flight. Meals were of poor quality, as it was on the other flights of UA, were served and the crew ran out of red wine very early on. Due to the very overcrowded condition of the flight, I could only sleep a couple of hours thanks to the courtesy of a flight attendant who gave me earplugs.",Detractor

Gatwick to Helsinki via Riga. airBaltic is a strictly budget airline in service but not in the cost of its fares. They charge extra for everything and if you did not book directly from their website you have to go through a strange and complicated procedure to book seats and meals etc. Both flights were late. RIX to HEL no explanation was given nor apology. Service by crew was efficient and quite friendly. The food pre-ordered was terrible. Greasy. No taste whatsoever. I did not eat the salad. I ordered wine because no beer was on offer on the pre-order. They refused to swap my wine to beer on the flight though would have sold me a beer separately. No thanks.

"  Used Aeroplan points for 4 in Premium Rouge from Toronto to Honolulu. The 767 was actually recently transferred from ""mainline"" to Rouge so was quite new in the sense that it had been completely redone inside so was very fresh. The cabin staff was really great, attentive, friendly and professional. Flight was 9+ hours and 2 meals were served. Food was ok, not much different than an Air Canada domestic exec class flight. FA's came through on a regular basis to offer water. Seats are ok as well, slightly larger and more legroom but obviously not a true business class or lie flat seat. Ipads in Premium Rouge have additional content but bring your own stuff if you really want to be sure you'll have something to watch. I have little patience for people who complain about not knowing their filght is on Rouge when they book it as Air Canada is extremely clear about it when booking and certainly on the ticket. Yes the seats are close together, you have to pay for everything, you need to bring your own ipad and connect to their app before takeoff, but it's all very clear upfront. If you don't like it and didn't pay less than a competitor then book with another airline and take a connecting flight - Rouge will still likely save you a connection. Set your expectations ahead of time and you will be pleasantly surprised.",Passive

Upon waking up, a second round of food and drinks service started and watched a Hollywood movie. The non veg option contained chicken and rajma with rice, salad and gulab jamun.

The plane was clean and so were the bathrooms contrary to many reviews I had read. The problem I had was when Spirit had to cancel my return flight due to weather with no options to return home for 5 days. I actually had to purchase a one way ticket home with another airline. My ""great deal on Spirit"" ended up costing me more than booking with another reliable carrier. Frustrated and angry are just a few of my emotions.

I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about.

I was then offered another seat which was next to another re-seated passenger obviously put out as he had been downgraded due to the plane being overbooked.

Ours both fit perfectly fine in all the overhead bins we had used in previous AA flights. I tried to ask the agent if this was necessary considering I was not asked to check mine even when it's the same size but she insisted it was. I feel as if American Airlines targeted us (my wife) for no apparent reason. We did not want to check our bags for a reason, they met the size requirements and we wanted to be able to get off the plane and not wait for our luggage. In addition to all this, they had us board the plane and sit at the gate while they fixed 3 machanical issues before pushing off.

The BA lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi-light of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew. Nothing short of amazing. I was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew. Absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about. Demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach. A fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist.

London to Cochin Kerala with my wife and son. I booked them because they were at least 25% cheaper than big name rivals. All 4 flights went smoothly with hardly any delays. Planes are older than some airlines but an upside of that is they seem to have more legroom! Entertainment system is also a non event but I knew that when booking. The only other minus for some may be the no alcohol policy but at least you arrive fresh at your destination! KWI airport is small but clean with decent facilities and easy to navigate. All outlets take credit cards even for a small purchases such as single fries or coffee so no currency hassles.

"Flying MXP-NRT and back in Oct-Nov 2014. Window single seat is excellent and full lie-flat. Entertainment system is OK but could be better. The food is better than business class average but I'm expecting a better wine selection when flying an Italian airline. During the flight flight attendants almost disappear just leaving some cheap self-service drinks and snacks (to be improved). Well the overall impression is that the crew doesn't look so motivated and willing to assist and please passengers. The atmosphere is a little ""sad"" compared to other business classes of competitors.",Promoter
"Los Angeles to Dayton. This was my first and last time flying with United Airlines. The customer service was horrific. My connecting flight from Denver got cancelled and I ran to the customer service desk to find a huge line had already formed and there were only 2 people working behind the desk. I waited for over 3 hours to speak to someone - when I finally got to the desk the woman was completely unhelpful and rude. She offered some inconvenient flights that wouldn't have gotten me home until late the next day. While in line I used my phone to find more convenient flights that I showed the woman and she says ""oh well I guess that would work too"". So I waited 3 hours to get absolutely no help. Since I was going to have to spend the night in the freezing airport, I asked if I could have a pillow and blanket for the evening (and I know they have them because they give bagged pillows and blankets to people in first class) - she told me that they don't provide amenities to people with cancelled flights. I also asked if I could have a food voucher since I was going to be at the airport for an extra 14+ hours that I hadn't planned on and she said they don't provide food vouchers to people unless their flight had been delayed for four hours. No my flight was not delayed for four hours it was cancelled and I was at the airport an extra 14 hours! So I ended up paying an extra $35 dollars on horrible, overpriced airport food because of my cancellation. I spent the night shivering, trying to sleep at the airport until my morning flight. My morning flight was then delayed for 2 hours ""due to weather"" even though the pilot came out and said the flight was delayed because of a lack of crew. But of course the workers told us we did not get amenities or discounts because the delayed was ""weather related"". Once I finally got back to Dayton, after waiting around the baggage pickup for 25 minutes-I discovered my luggage was missing and customer service told me it was still in Denver! Once again they told me they don't offer any compensation for the inconvenience. My bag didn't arrive at my house for over 32 hours.",Detractor

When I boarded the plane, I went straight to the washroom. It was absolutely filthy and the toilet was full. Had obviously not been cleaned between flights. As a result, it absolutely stank, the entire flight. There was garbage in my seat pocket, and the seat was dirty. I will never fly Air Canada Rouge again, despicable.",Detractor

When I found the ticket information in the web-site and showed them again, they sent me to another terminal. There I was also redirected for a long time. When my nerves exploded, the airline representatives said that the hotel provision was not selected in the booking history. The staff could not provide the hotel. They also offered to spend time in the lounge area for 80 yuan / 3 hours. Good service and food aboard, but I do not recommend this airline because of the blunt Chinese ground staff.

"  London to Colorado Springs via Dallas. After reading the reviews, before my flight earlier this month, I was concerned to say the least. Dreading my upcoming flight almost. But, after having flown Delta to Colorado Springs in December 2016. I am pleased to be able to say the conditions on AA main cabin were as good as, if not better in one area, as Delta. I can't actually see the justification for bad reviews in main cabin. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The seat pitch was fine. I would go as far to say I feel like I had more leg room on AA than I did on Delta, but the seat width is noticeably less than other flights I've been on. Thankfully there was a seat between myself and the other passenger in my row, otherwise we would literally be squashed in, banging elbows and almost would be impossible to eat comfortably without encroaching on the space of the person next to you. I was contemplating paying extra for main cabin extra, but from what I saw, I'm glad I didn't. I would save your money as I couldn't see any significant difference in leg room, although it's supposed to provide an additional 6 inches. I wasn't uncomfortable in normal main cabin where I'd see paying extra worthwhile. Food is to be as expected when flying economy, it was acceptable but I've had better presented, tastier food on economy with other airlines. Drink choice was bare minimum acceptable. Not the best economy experience I've had, but acceptable. Cabin crew service was polite and friendly. Nothing really to comment on over and above what's expected. IFE was actually quite good. Lots of choice with current and classic movie choices. Overall. Not a bad experience. Certainly better than I expected.",Passive
Economy class SYD-HKG-EWR. Professional and respectful service on both legs and it was particularly good on the HKG-EWR leg. The HKG-EWR flight is one of the longest flights in the world but I found it very comfortable. After a 15 hr 20 min flight I emerged feeling pretty good. Seats are good good choice of food and sufficient variety in the IFE choices to keep passengers entertained. Cabin crew took care to ensure cabin and toilets remained clean throughout.

My wife and I (both seniors) were in Premium Economy Class (Seats 31H and 31K) on flight CX879 from SFO to HKG (with connection to BLR) on 12th September 2013. During our onward flight from HKG to SFO in March 2013 we had felt very cramped in Economy Class and so we got our tickets upgraded for our return journey in September. Little did we know at that time what a wise decision that was. After the flight CX879 took off on 12th September 2013 the elderly passenger in front of us took ill. The flight was diverted to Anchorage in order to offload the passenger and then we landed at Taipei for crew change. Finally after being in the aircraft for 20 hours we landed at HKG on 14th morning very tired. We had of course missed the connecting flight. We were afraid that there would be a crowd and big confusion at the transfer counter. We thought we might have to spend long hours at the airport. We were in for a delightful surprise. We found a long table arranged with all the new boarding passes envelopes with hotel coupons and cash for meals also instructions for transport to hotel. We could not believe our eyes. We were accommodated at J W Marriott where we could take good rest and take the BLR flight on 14th night. We should also add that the 20-hour flight was made bearable because we were in Premium Economy. One complaint: On that long flight no clear announcements were made about our landing time arrangements made for connecting flights etc. Because of my good experience with CP last year I am again travelling BLR-HKG-SFO on July 22 2014 by Premium Economy. Even though the price was high for me I still decided to pay extra for the comfort.,Passive

"London to Johannesburg return. Still waiting for a reply, after 6 attempts via email, post and phone to make contact. On flight BA 0055 to Johannesburg the inflight service was the worst we have ever experienced. We took off around 19h30, and were only offered a drink at 21h30. This was the only drink offered that night. Dinner was served at 22h30, no drinks accompanied this. We were surprised to see we were sitting in the back row of the plane, which was not what was shown on the diagram when we booked and paid extra for selecting our seats when we made the booking. We did not have a choice of meals as they had run out, all we were offered was a very poor excuse for a mushroom risotto, which was inedible. It took over an hour for the trays to be cleared away. Breakfast was served to the special diets around 04h30, waking the entire section where we were seated, then the lights turned off for another hour until we were offered an equally horrible breakfast. Coffee was not offered at all - the amount of liquids offered was below minimum requirements, if we had not taken our own water with us we would have had a problem. When we departed the plane it look like a rubbish tip, no waste had been collected during the flight, the cabin staff were surly and uninterested. Prior to this flight we tried to avoid the â€œback of planeâ€ issues by paying an additional Â£56.00 for exit row seats. The payment was accepted and receipt issued via email. When we went to check in online our original seats had been allocated again. When we arrived at Johannesburg airport we were told that the seats were no longer available and had been allocated to other passengers. No apology or explanation was given. Not the way we wanted our holiday to end. The service on this flight was as to be expected, regular drinks offered (water throughout the night), the only negatives being no choice for dinner and a poor breakfast. Cabin staff were very good. We have not received a refund for the Â£56.00 paid for the exit row seats, and I await an explanation as to why these seats were not allocated to us. Even though we were flying economy, we expect a level of service and edible food. If the back rows are to receive less or no choice on food and drinks then they should be charged less. This is unfair and bad business practice. Upon speaking to other people who have flown with BA, the general consensus seems to be that only first / business class passengers seem to be valued, and our experience confirms this. BA were not the cheapest flights by far, we opted to fly with them due to reputation, which was sorely let down.",Detractor

WAW-HEL-NRT with A340. I have been flying with Finnair on this route for years as for me it is the fastest connection from Europe to Japan. However my current trip had more cons than pros.

"Air Canada rouge got it right when they claimed that ""You've never flown leisure like this before.""b What an unbelievably horrible - and expensive - travel experience. Air Canada's attempt to save money is clearly ""charge the same high fare for bare-bones travel"". In short there's not much more that I can say that hasn't already been said but here it goes: - Cheaply made and poorly designed seats that are so tightly packed together that anyone taller than 4'8"" is going to be uncomfortable. - Brand new flight attendants who bad-mouth their employer in the back of the cabin in front of customers. - Surly customer service reps at the airports - obviously dealing with the stress of unhappy customers. - Bare-bones service overall.I flew non-stop from Toronto to San Diego and this was my first and will be my last trip ever on rouge.

"  My flight from Denver to San Francisco got cancelled 8 hours prior to departure. The email was three sentences long and did not give a reason.

After quickly finding a better flight with Southwest, I looked at my phone and the representative had hung up! Had to recall again and wait another 30 minutes just to ask for a refund.

They are happy to prepare you a drink that cannot just be poured out of a bottle, like my gin and tonic yesterday. They keep coming with water and juice throughout the flight every 30 minutes or so. I have never seen this on a long flight before. They are still friendly and heap it up for you. Even more surprising is the state of the toilets. I'd almost feel sorry for the crew if I hadn't paid a fair amount of money for my flight. They are still clean one or two hours before landing. Thank you for this great experience.",Promoter

"The Spirit Airlines flight from St. Thomas to Ft. Lauderdale was delayed by 4 hours due to airline communications failure. The St. Thomas desk crew tried their best, but clearly had no training in this sort of thing - they were in complete disarray. Because our connecting flights would be missed, they promised us food and hotel vouchers for Ft. Lauderdale - then these never materialized. Then they promised we could pick them up right when we got off the plane in Ft. Lauderdale. When we arrived, staff just shrugged and told us to go to the ticket counter and see what we could get. There we were told to wait in a line that took over an hour to get through, we rebelled and insisted on getting the vouchers immediately. It still took half an hour, we finally got them at midnight. The folks who waited in line never did get hotel vouchers - the airline had 'run out of them' - meaning they had run out of vouchers at the preferential rate they'd negotiated, and were unwilling to pay extra for these beleagured passengers. So those passengers stayed in the airport all night, furious over empty promises and terrible customer service.",Detractor
"I recently flew with Southwest. I was extremely disappointed in the dysfunctional boarding system. Although I was aware that the Southwest boarding system was different I had no idea how poorly it could work in reality. Long story short: whatever you do do not pay extra for a business select ticket. I needed to travel within the last few weeks from St Louis International airport to Washington Dulles International airport. I would have preferred a direct flight but being able to stow both carryon bags without using gate check is a big plus. In order to get a better seat on the airplane I paid the extra money for a business select ticket. This puts you near the front if not at the front of the line. Southwest seating is first come first serve. On my way to D.C. the system worked well enough although on my first flight I did not get a great seat as I was boarding in position A15. That didn't bother me much the system had worked as designed. My second flight I was first in line and pretty content with the outcome. However on one of my return flights things got extremely frustrating. The problem started when it was time to board after a layover at Midway airport in Chicago. Now I first want to say that I support the idea of allowing people who are handicapped to pre-board. But I do not support the idea of letting them take all the best seats on the plane. My ticket from Midway to St Louis had me boarding in position A1 theoretically the very first passenger to board if not for pre-boarding. There were four pre-board passengers ahead of me. When the gate agent called for pre-boarding around six more family members who were clearly strong healthy adults decided to board with them. Not acceptable. By the time I got on the plane all of the very best seats with extra leg room in the front row where taken. The four very best seats where occupied by the healthy family members who decided that they were entitled to board with their handicapped family members. Why can't Southwest declare the front row an ""exit row""? It is an exit row! That would prevent pre-boarders from sitting there. What did I pay extra for to get priority seating if Southwest is just going to give those seats away to some very dishonest people? In the end: I paid and they did not deliver. I recommend that if you choose to fly Southwest do not pay extra for the business select ticket. I personally will not be flying Southwest again under any circumstances.",Detractor
Went from JFK to CDG and back in premium economy. Sky priority allowed us to check in and get through security very quickly. We took advantage of the business class lounge (paid about $50 per person) and thought it was well worth it for the food wine and quiet. The premium economy seats although roomier than economy were nowhere near business class standards so do not expect to get a comfortable night's sleep. I did appreciate the extra legroom and the fixed shell design as this made it feel quite spacious. The food was really quite good (though keep in mind it is from an airline not a French bistro) and the service was very polite and friendly. I felt very taken care of the entire flight and would definitely travel on Air France again over most of its competitors.,Promoter

"  New York JFK to Dublin. This is in reference to my flight with Aer Lingus El108 which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday, April 18th from JFK to Dublin, Ireland. Prior to departure I received an e.mail advising that the flight was delayed from 8:50 pm to 10:45pm. On arrival at the Airport my family and I were greeted by non Aer Lingus staff and handed a piece of paper apologizing for the disruption to our travel plans - the Flight had been cancelled and no explanation was given as to why. Included was an â€œ800â€ number (800-585-0672) to call and rebook or get a refund. I immediately started to call the 800 number which constantly rang with no response - some people were put on hold for a considerable amount of time and had to end up hanging up. When I approached a representative from Aer Lingus, who was constantly on his cell phone and not very approachable, I was basically told they couldn't guarantee that I would get on another flight on April 19th (the next day). Our travel plans were time sensitive since we were attending my niece's wedding and my sister was acting as the mother of the bride since my niece's Mum has passed away. I had no choice but to rebook flights with another carrier so we were guaranteed to at least attend the wedding! I called Aer Lingus the following morning and finally got a response to find out that all Aer Lingus flights were already booked out. In addition, I was told that the representative at the Airport should have informed us that they would do all in their power to get us on a flight the next day. In this case Aer Lingus should be responsible for the extra charges that was imposed on us because of their lack of responsibility. I returned from my two week trip to discover that Customer Service didn't have the common courtesy to respond to my email nor had they refunded, as promised, the money for the flight that was cancelled. I had to waste my time and energy dealing with their incompetent customer service and had to explain my case again and demanded a refund. I finally got an email of apology about the cancelled flight and the importance of reliable and safe travel and that I'm in total agreement with, however, I have a difficult time dealing with disinterested staff who appear not to care about their customers. Since Aer Lingus did not make any effort to resolve this issue, in a timely fashion, I will no longer consider Aer Lingus as a carrier of choice, nor will I recommend Aer Lingus as a travel option to others. Quite honestly Aer Lingus lag behind their counterparts when it comes to inflight courtesy and customer service.

" I had my reservations after booking with Kuwait Airways when reading some of the reviews, but financially I thought yep it'll be ok. We departed England on the 16 December, Heathrow terminal 4, the check in was quite frankly horrendous and the member of staff was abrupt, rude and mean, but I thought you pay the price you take your chance. After checking in and all the security checks we boarded our flight to Kuwait.

Arrived in Kuwait, 6 hours of nothing, quite possibly the most desolete airport of nothing. We were given a free meal consisting of a cheese roll, stodgy cake and an orange juice. Our connecting flight to Manila was again ok, again staff very hit and miss. Enjoyed our three week holiday and returned to Manila Ninnoy international airport for return trip on the 7 Jan 2019.

Flight back to England again ok but all the same issues as before. My thoughts on Kuwait Airways?

" Dubai to Toronto via Istanbul. My wife encountered a problem in Istanbul that involved an airport transit visa through Canada. It took about 8 hours of our time at 5 different airport locations to eventually buy new tickets to get back the next day. Our original tickets say: â€œReissue With 200 USD penalty. What I didn't see was the fine print at the bottom: â€œTurkish Airlines reserves the right to change rules regarding ticket changes and refunds.â€. They mean it. As bad as our personal experience was, the real reason we are so appalled is that we were there long enough to see this is the norm for them. In our single day there, we saw at least 100 other travelers going through similar things. The only solution ever offered is to purchase another ticket. We witnessed several people weeping. Many losing control and shouting. Their own personnel were screaming at customers (in a separate office area though, it was all yucks and laughing). We were lucky because we had the means to purchase new tickets. Others clearly didn't. I don't know what happened to some of them. One moment was very symbolic of the entire experience. Another vanquished traveler was paying $843 for a new ticket with cash. He handed an employee $845 but she of course had no change. Instead of the $5, he gave her two $1 bills. I had one in my pocket so gave it to her as well. She held my $1 bill up and pointed to the corner which had a very small piece torn off, no ink was missing, and sneered â€œI can't accept thisâ€. She did this simply because she could. We were powerless. She knew it and reveled in it. I usually only add reviews if they're positive. I understand people and businesses can have a bad day.

The only I made was some sad sandwiches and after checking 4 empty bottles on display I found some warm French white wine. Therefore, I decided to cut my time spent in the â€œcomfortable private loungeâ€ and treat myself with some Costa coffee and some nice tasty sushi in the terminal. Waiting for the promised menu which â€œfeatures irresistible meal options crafted to perfectly match the time and duration of your flightâ€. Couple months ago a tasty plate with canapÃ©s was offered to passengers in Club Europe. In the London-Bucharest flight I was offered the eternal option â€œbeef or fishâ€ with, indeed, a nice polite smile from the Purser. The tray looked like an Economy tray on a Tarom or KLM flight to Bucharest. No salad, an overlapping end-of meal option of cheese and lemon merengue and a fish which was the blandest food I ever had onboard. When I was still looking for my â€œvery British experienceâ€ the tray was taken away. Coffee and a second round of drinks were served shortly after the main meal service was finished. I couldn't stop wondering where that smooth, stylish service from my last flight went. Of course, the crew was polite and nice as much as they can, shaping their enthusiasm according the product offered to passengers. And another odd element: no other drink service",Detractor
Flew MEL to Wellington NZ on QF171. Full flight on a 737-800 left and arrived on time. Cabin staff were cheerful and the service was fine. The hot meal was simple but tasty. The 737 seating is very cramped and the in-flight movie offering mediocre to say the least. For a 4 hour flight its OK but it wouldn't take too much of a technology boost to provide a bit more offering in the entertainment area.,Passive
 Los Angeles to Tokyo via Beijing. Worst airline I have been on. If you are over 6 feet tall you will be miserable and there is nothing you can do. I would never fly with them for several reasons but the fact that they screwed up my itinerary then charged me 800 dollars was the main reason. Its hard finding someone who speaks english. The food was horrible and the seating is very small. I wish I would have read the reviews before I booked.,Detractor
" Hong Kong to Brussels. Used to fly CX a lot when we lived in HK and was looking forward to flying their business class again. What a disappointment! Seats don't seem as spacious and luxurious as before. The breakfast was tiny. All I got in the continental breakfast was a mini pastry, natural yogurt with a tiny bit of granola and fruit. There was butter but no bread to spread it on! No coffee refill. What happened to the lovely service where food was brought out on elegant carts with bread baskets offered several times? The toilets were also not business standard, more like a good economy. Flew Singapore Airlines out and their premium eco toilets were better than Cathay business. Very sad to see such a supreme airline lower their standard like that. Also the lounge at the airport was so overfilled the exclusive touch is completely lost. Poor food selection. Nice shower facility, though.",Passive
"  London Heathrow to Santorini. We flew with 6 of our family to Santorini, the business class seats are a joke I am 6'3"" but I just could not move in the seats they are so tight. We then learnt from the steward that it's a new configuration that hasn't gone down very well with customers. This once great airline that's gone from the best to the worst in 5 years, and on European routes it's no more than a budget carrier, money is the key driver for BA with customers very last on the list. We all felt we had paid for a service we never received.",Passive
For some reason First Class is not always available on the Abu Dhabi to Athens leg and so after travelling FC from MEL I had to use the Business Class Lounge. Fine - except for the fact that there was not enough room for everyone to sit down. After a long trip this is not amusing. Perhaps this lounge should be enlarged as everything else about the lounge is more than adequate. Why is it that there is no sign (a green light something!) to indicate that the toilets are empty? This would appear to be a fairly standard design detail. Very inconvenient. I have travelled on FC and BC on Etihad and am satisfied. However the real test of an airline is how it treats its Economy Class passengers. I will be checking out these comments.,Promoter

"  I actually took the flight a couple of months back and only now had the chance to write a review. I took the late flight from HKG to London Heathrow which left at 23.55, which is great as you get a full night's sleep and arrive at LHR without any jet lag - great if you've got a full day of work ahead of you! The business class offering from Cathay Pacific is superb. At HK airport I got access to several lounges spread through the airport. My favourite being The Wing. The flight itself was excellent. Extremely courteous and efficient FAs. I think that the business class seats in Cathay are as good as some first class seats on some airlines. The seat fully reclined to a flat bed with ample space to stretch. Im 5'7"" by the way. The 1-2-1 configuration means all seats get aisle access and you don't feel claustrophobic, which you do on some of the other airlines that have a 2-2-2 configuration. All in all a great flight. Just looking forward to trying the new business class on the A350!",Promoter
LHR to KEF return. Clean comfortable 757 in both directions with pleasant cabin crew. I don't mind paying for a snack inflight but Icelandair could try harder with what's on offer! Late going out due to excessive traffic both in and out of LHR and return due to late arrival of incoming aircraft but time was made up by 20/30 minutes in both directions. The only problems were with unhelpful (KEF) and rude (LHR) ground staff. What a pity.,Passive
"  I flew this airline almost every month a few years ago and had a large number of miles accumulated. The airline then changed in structure and ultimately stopped servicing my home city of Spokane, WA. I was pleased to hear they had re-started service this year and so I could finally again use all my miles I accumulated. I reached out after finding they had wiped my account of all miles. Generally speaking, I understand they expire at times, but in this case the airline itself prevented me from using them as a result of their stop in service to my market. I reached out on 3 separate occasions to get some credits, even partial and all were met with a non empathetic tough luck. This airline will never get my business or anyone on my staff's again. Losing thousands and thousands of dollars to save 2 free flights which were earned by someone who had reached one of their former elite tiers in flying. Just unintelligent business.",Detractor

Zhengzhou to Bangkok via Guangzhou on 28/05/2013. No whiskey only red and white wine. No food. Chicken mentioned in the menu but no chicken.

Then the Captain arrives and sits next to me with a sheet of paper saying that I could mention the problem and he would translate into Chinese. I said no and that I would fill it in myself.

Our flight was from LAX to Shanghai. Our flight left on time both directions. The plane was clean and the seats were fairly comfortable. They reclined much more than a lot of economy class flights I've been on. We were served two full meals and one snack. The food was probably a 3 on a scale of 1-5. Not as awful as I expected. Usually chicken pork beef or fish with noodles or rice. We did get salads on the LA leg. They only served red wine and beer and when the two bottles of red wine was gone that was it. No mixed drinks. Our flight attendants spoke a little English and were courteous. My big complaint was I booked this flight through Webjet and it was difficult to confirm our flight. Tried calling several times and was on hold for over 45 minutes once with no answer. Web site was difficult to navigate I eventually emailed China Eastern and was told I was confirmed. I was unable to choose seats. If you can choose your seats try rows 70-74 with window seats as there are only two seats instead of three. I was able to score these seats on the return flight. The inflight entertainment was excellent with over 50 English speaking movies to choose from as well as some foreign films and games.,Passive
"The new Austrian luggage restrictions and payment for checked in luggage causes passengers to bring way too much luggage into the cabin, and the crew is not able to handle it in a good manner.

"A very smooth and pleasant flight from start to finish. The bag drop queue at Terminal 5 was long but moved reasonably fast. Onboard a small snack of crisps and a drink was served, which was fine. The flight operated on time. My only quibble was that a label was put on my backpack instructing me to keep it at my feet, presumably so that other people with unreasonably large take-on bags could easily put them in the overhead bins (while I suffered less legroom than them). Apart from the safety issue of hand baggage stuck on the floor, this policy penalises people who do the right thing and encourages others to take big items of ""hand"" luggage. Come on, BA, enforce a your hand luggage rules and don't penalise considerate passengers.",Promoter
"Madrid to Tbilisi with Pegasus Airlines - before flying, I checked reviews and I started to fear my decision but my experience was good. Check-in online worked and at the counter in the airport - no problems. Cabin crew were young and nice. Aircraft was a new Boeing 737-800. Food onboard was a choice from 5 menus, salads, sandwiches and snacks and prices were normal. They give you 330cc cans of drink. Service on board was as good as any ""full-service"" airline. Luggage arrived safe and sound (stop-over included). I fly low-cost every time I can because the airlines must be good, efficient, cost-effective and the best choice to survive.",Promoter
"I have just taken a very long haul flight half way across the world with Etihad in economy, and I am shocked at the service I received. Etihad seriously lacks in a lot of areas. I expected so much more from such a high profile airline. Check-in was the best part as a member of staff noticed I am very tall and sourced an exit row seat for me which I was extremely thankful for as it was a 13hr flight, but the tired Boeing 777 had uncomfortable aged seats and I couldn't wait to land. I selected a non-lactose meal, and it seemed to be half the amount of the regular meal, why is this? I had no bread roll or desert (both didn't contain dairy). On a 13hr flight we were only given two small meals and a snack which was a muffin. I didn't see any attendants for hours in between meals. I only noticed one lot of drinks being bought round, and other customers had to constantly call for drinks and food, and when asked it seemed such a big effort for them. The attendant who served me hardly spoke English, and didn't have a clue what was going on. I asked for a coffee and the cup wasn't even half full. I asked her why, and she said she ran out of coffee! Abu Dhabi airport shops were all high end expensive boutiques, not much opportunities for normal people. Most travelers were swarming the food court and alcohol and tobacco shops, no one was in the expensive ones. Toilets were disgusting! I asked at a transfer desk if there was any way I could get an exit row seat, I was just told ""no, the flight is full"". Unexceptable in my opinion. It is so uncomfortable and stressful having to sit in a regular seat when you are very tall, it makes the journey a nightmare. The A380 was a nicer plane, but everything else was still terrible - like the first leg. Attendants were rude and unhelpful, they had no sympathy for me being squashed in a normal seat. This was only a 7hr flight but we received more drinks than the 13hr flight? On both flights VOD was awful. I had flown with Etihad a few years ago and it was just the same, but I thought I would try again and see if they had improved due to the new fleet of aircraft, but how wrong I was. Next time I shall fly with Qatar Airways or Singapore Airways.",Detractor
LH456 from Frankfurt to Los Angeles. The flight went smoothly and on time (arriving ahead of schedule). No complaints about the flight conditions and service except the performance of the information/entertainment system. The touch screen was not responding thus making the use impossible.

Returned to the lounge to find it packed, so back to the gate to wait there. MIA-FRA uninterested cabin crew, though polite, went thru the motions. We had to ask for everything we needed, as staff never came to check on us. Internet paid for but did not function. No mid flight snacks. Boarded a boiling cabin in the Florida heat to be told to wait till we taxi when the A/C will kick in - sweating for over an hour. My 6000EUR spent on those tickets were a total waste of money.

I flew a 747 in first class from San Francisco to Seoul Korea. For a 13 hour flight I was expected to be tired when I reached my destination. However I was wrong. When I entered the aircraft I was immediately asked what beverage I would like as well as providing hot towels. The crew were very nice and gave us hand written Thank You notes for my business. The food was better than I expected it to be. They served so many appetizers before the main course that I was full. I was so surprised when they asked if I would like ice cream and customized it with toppings right in front of me! If you were hungry between meals there is a walk up bar that has fruits snacks wraps desserts etc. The IFE had a huge screen and had all the newest Hollywood blockbusters tv shows music and games. The seats were really comfortable as they had the option to put them 180 degrees so that you can sleep (the armrests automatically go down as the bed reclines) and can sleep comfortably for a tall person. They also had plenty of plugs that accepts USA and other countries plugs. The seats have plenty of storage however found it odd that flight attendants won't allow you to stow things under your seat. I slept right after the Meal service and was woken up just in time for breakfast. I couldn't believe that I could actually get sleep on a plane!

"After flying Ryanair for the past 7 years, I found a cheap fare for Aer Lingus, I didn't hesitate to book the flag-carrier for my return leg. Boarding was a shambles to be blunt about it, like cows walking into a barn, just banging into each other and no order of a queue. This was due to handling agents at Venice and not EI crew. The departure was speedy and comfortable, the crew were very smily and friendly upon boarding. The captain have numerous updates throughout the flight about delays and our ETA. Meal service was excellent. Although slow, this didn't matter on the 3 hour flight. The food was so fresh. I could tell the scone was baked recently and the bread on my sandwich was so soft. The best inflight food I've head in a while to be honest. Although it's not free, it is reasonably priced.

" Melbourne to Belgrade via Abu Dhabi. I have been using Etihad for the last 7 years, initially we were happy with the service. Later on we joined Etihad guest programm, as 4 of us from our family traveling often , and that helps to earn miles. In the past we often didn't get credits for our flight, so we tried to do retroclaim by ourselves but sometimes it didn't work when we upgraded from the economy into business class. We would write to retroclaim centre and that would help, but sometimes even that wouldn't help and we had to ring, but eventually the problem would be sorted out. The last flight of my wife hasn't been credited for a long time but now we need these miles soon in order for us to book the next flight. Despite writing to retroclaim and ringing Etihad which has got the call centre in Belgrade, nothing helped. In the last 7 weeks I rang the Etihad call centre in Belgrade four times and was disappointed how they handled my concern. When I rang for the third time I explained tat I needed these miles in a 10 days time in order to book the next flight. I expected help as I earned the gold Etihad guest card after all these years. The operator promised to me that she would personally take care of the situation and in 10 days she would update me with the progress by phone call. After 10 days nothing was done so I decided to ring. After waiting for about two and half hours and no one ringing me I rang back and this time spoke to a very rude person who kept interrupting me and basically told me to just wait as they can't help.

"  San Diego to Los Cabos. My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary with a trip we saved up for, to Cabo San Lucas. Got to airport prepared with all of our documents, printed and ready to go. We visited the desk to check our bag in with your customer representative, as we were excited and ready for our trip we were greeted by a very unhappy face. We did not get a smile, no hello, not anything. This was not a great start but let us move on and get over it. Flight time came around. We walked up to the desk after the lady at the flight check in made sure to tell everyone to have their passport open with the picture and if you don't have it open on that page that you would be sent to the back of the line. Once we got to the male checking us in he clicked his tongue and said he doesn't know why we weren't forced to pay extra to print out our boarding passes on two separate papers instead of double sided. Now for the horror show. Our flight was meant to leave on Monday around 2:45pm. As asked we got to the airport early with enough time to clear check-in etc. The staff was a little friendlier in Mexico at first. Check-in went as planned with no issues. We went inside for some lunch and walked over to our terminal to get ready to start boarding when we noticed that our flight has been delayed. Again not too unhappy since these things do happen. Well I guess it kept getting delayed and delayed so much that all the other flights left Cabo, the shops closed they even turned off the AC in the airportâ€¦ This sucks since we could have booked another flight to LAX, San Diego or Santa Ana without having to spend more time in Cabo. Finally around 6:30pm after being at the airport for 6 hours sweating with no shops, food, water, Internet we were told that our flight has now been canceled with no reason offered as to why it was canceled. We were all booked, probably 120 people at the Best Western across the street. So if you have been to the Cabo airport there is the airport, Best Western and a gas stationâ€¦ That is it. When we got our hotel voucher we were told by Spirit that since my wife and I booked our vacation together we would have to share the $7 meal voucher YAY!! To make things worse, Spirit had 2 front desk people help 120 people with vouchers so imagine the wait. If you think that wait was bad, they got us a little van carrying 8 people at a time to transport 120 people to the hotel. At this time we were told that our flight might leave at 1pm on Tuesday. Spend the night at the great Best Western canceling work for Tuesday with poor internet. No apology was given until we received a $50 coupon for our next adventure with this great airline. Tuesday morning arrived and again we took the same van back to the airport with the rest of the army, checking in again. Our flight was scheduled for 1pm. 1:30pm rolled by with more delays saying we are waiting for the pilot to arrive! We actually saw one employee call the captain and his response was that he is busy on the phone? As he finally stopped his important call the whole â€œarmyâ€ cheered him on as he walked by us all. This is now around 2pm, again no apologies no reasons! We would ask Spirit staff about the delays and we would simply receive an answer of only a couple more minutes.",Detractor

On this 7.5 hour flight I was served one hot meal, one hot snack, a small snack, and unlimited beverages. One flight attendant was extremely nice to me and even brought me two ice cream's. I upgraded to economy plus for around $200 and the only thing you get is more leg room. The seat is the same as in the regular economy cabin and the service is the same.

" Horrible service and behavior of ground staff. I was returning from Helsinki to New Delhi via Moscow. I was supposed to get two boarding passes from Helsinki airport, which they were unable to provide as according to them, the flights from Moscow to India was overbooked and they could not provide the boarding pass. As the layover time at Moscow was only for 2 hours, I was a little bothered. But with no option left I reached Moscow and ran to the ground staff for the next boarding pass which they said I would not get as the flight is overbooked. So they were providing me a flight which was in the evening or the next day. I had connecting flight scheduled from Delhi to Bangalore but they said nothing can be done. After a lot of arguments finally they allowed me to board the flight, I started waiting in front of the gate assigned for boarding. Boarding time as mentioned in the boarding pass started but there was no staff from the Aeroflot at the desk. Suddenly one of the fellow passenger came to our rescue saying she heard someone say there has been a gate change. At the gate only 7-8 people were waiting to board the flight. So it was like do panic again and run for information here and there and finally find out the proper gate from where the real boarding was happening and majority of the passengers were standing. After getting into flight I realized it was without any inflight entertainment and the journey was for 7 hours. Regarding the toilets, 2 of them were spared for the economy class people and rest were for business class. The worst trip I had in my life.",Detractor
Bangkok to Manchester return via Doha 12th and 19th September. The new Doha airport is of course a great improvement on the old one but some issues still continue: checking into the flight at the gate meant pushing 250 people into a space designed for probably 100 rather an unseemly start - it wasn't possible so many of us had to wait until some had got on the plane. The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find â€“ I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge.

"  All round very disappointing flight with Aeromexico from Mexico to Brazil. Service was indistinguishable from what I would expect in Economy class. Seat was flat but at a steep incline and then as such good for rest but not sleep. Food was woeful although given that it was served at 1am I wasn't really in mood to eat. (not their fault - departure time was nearly midnight). Hated Mexico City airport. Lounge was pretty hopeless except for a couple of helpful waiters who managed to organise some crisps and Coca-Cola. Entertainment was ok, not great. The only good thing about this flight was the price which was barely above premium economy.

" Dublin to Raleigh via Newark. I have never left a review for an airline in 30 years of travel (first time for everything). Our flight experience yesterday was pretty bad, and after dealing with the customer service today, I feel the need to write this. First, dropping our checked bags at the Dublin airport took 50 minutes which I find ridiculous (thank goodness we arrived 3 hours early). The staff wasn't exactly efficient or in a hurry. Second, our flight was delayed 45 minutes to Newark. That's fine, delays happen, but when I tried asking a flight attendant if we were in jeopardy of missing our connection, it took 30 minutes for me to even flag someone down on the flight (even though my call light was on the whole time), and she was extremely rude and short. The flight attendants in general were less than friendly, especially when I asked if they had snacks for purchase and the attendant looked at me like I was dumb and said no. Got it. We finally arrive to our final destination in Raleigh and our bags did not arrive with us. We were informed they'd be on the next flight, but since we live three hours away, they said they would have them flown to Columbia, SC and would arrive Saturday night around 11pm, and then would be delivered to us.  No big deal again, we get these things happen. Well, here we are Sunday at 10:00am, and the bags are nowhere to be found.  It took me 30+ minutes to speak with someone in customer service and the language barrier is so bad, that I still don't know when our bags will arrive or why they didn't make the flight to Columbia last night. It's not the poor man's fault, sometimes it's just too difficult for both parties. I asked to speak to a supervisor but was told he was busy and would call me back (doubtful). I also called back and asked if I could speak with someone whose native language was English to avoid the language barrier and frustration (two attempts failed). They finally told me calls are globally routed and I'd have to keep calling until a native English speaker answered (30 min wait time each call). This goes far beyond things out of United's control happening, and today finally made me realize it's just terrible customer service.  I am done making excuses for United and the people I have dealt with during my travels.  No desire to travel on this airline again. I'm flustered so I'm sure there are typos. Great trip where I got engaged and ended on a bad note. Now we need to buy a bunch of items just so we can go to work tomorrow morning.",Detractor

After fighting with a very nice agent, she was able to get our flight to ""reopen"" and get us on the flight. After running through the airport we got to our gate and barely made our flight. After arriving in Columbia, Avianca called my name for extra security measures. They searched me extensively and never once able to explain to me in English what they were doing or why. Once I finally got on the plane, the agent had change our seats on the next flight from an aisle and window in the front, to the far back of the plane in the middle. They have some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced.",Detractor
"  Seoul to Rome. Check-in staff courteous and helpful, particularly with seat allocation and check-in of baggage through to my ultimate destination. Queue at check-in long so the wait time was quite long. The service by the flight crew was excellent - friendly and courteous. Food choices were good (three mains) but the Korean meal (spicy octopus) was a little too spicy and I would have preferred a bibimbap. The plane was well maintained, clean and fairly new.",Promoter
"  My experience with Spirit Airlines was the worst that I have had with any airline. Between them changing my flights and all the delays, it took me over 30 hours to get back home to Atlanta from Las Vegas! They changed my return flight to travel from Las Vegas - Los Angeles - Ft Lauderdale - Atlanta. My children and I will never make this mistake again. I didn't even include all the problems I encountered with booking the flight. In the long run, I would have saved money and time booking with a more repritable company.",Detractor

"  London Heathrow to Newark. Two evenings prior to my flight I used British Airways Android app to reserve extended legroom seats for my wife and me. At the time, advance reservation of regular seats was $51 and $59 for front-section extended legroom seats. I had no interest in reserving a regular seat (I could wait until 24 hours before check-in for that) but I was interested in purchasing the extended legroom seats. So I paid the $118 for the two front-section seats. When my wife and I boarded the craft, lo and behold, the seats were not front-section seats at all! I was able to pull up the confirmation of purchase on my Android Phone and the cabin services director did his job very nicely, apologizing to us, offering us to file an incident report and reassuring us that all would be taken care of post-flight. However, subsequent to the flight, British Airways has been positively nasty in their response, claiming that we were given the seats for which our boarding passes were issued (true enough) and completely ignoring the point that they had misrepresented those seats as front-section when they were not. The fact that I received zero goods or services for my $118 beyond what I was already entitled to by my payment of the base fare means nothing to them. They have managed to bilk me out of $118 and having gotten their hands on my money, they intend to keep it. We'll see what my credit card company has to say about this, but it would be a lot smoother if we could simply settle this amicably, rather than forcing me to dispute the charge with my credit card company. Suffice it to say that my wife and I will not be flying BA again.",Detractor

"  UX flights Paris Orly to Madrid and Madrid to Alicante. The first flight from ORY to MAD was late. Eventually I arrived to MAD at 13:50, and boarding for the next flight to ALC was scheduled for 14:05. On board of my flight to Madrid nobody could give me any information about my connection, even about the gate number. Upon my arrival in MAD it turned out that the next flight to ALC disappeared from the screens. At the UX transfer desk (poorly marked) a very relaxed staff member told me the flight to ALC was 'on hold' and that she had no clue if it would eventually take place. I went to the lounge (I am a gold AF member) and around 14:50 I was told the flight was about to board. No extra explanations, just an arrogant 'hurry up'. In sum, even though UX is a SkyTeam member, its service is way worse than on Transavia and way worse than on KL or AF. I was on AirEuropa flights for a number of times, mostly on intra-EU flights. UX is a no-frills airline with a very poor customer service.",Detractor
" Beijing to Newcastle via Amsterdam. The actual flight was ok. Nothing special. But the worst part of this whole ordeal was the way they handled things behind the scenes. On my way to Newcastle they lost my bag. Ok no problem. Mistakes can happen. I get my claim reference number and then get a text the next day that my bag will be arriving. I go check for the bag they said they left at reception and it is the wrong bag. In my description of the bag I said that it is a hard shell gray suitcase. The bag that showed up was a soft black bag. I call KLM letting them know that the wrong bag showed up and they tell me that I have to bring the bag back to the airport. I tell them no because it was their mistake and why should I go out of my way on my 13 day vacation to fix their mistake. They apologized and said they would send someone over to pick it up. In my 13 days in Newcastle I probably called them over 27 times. Each time being told that they are still looking for the bag. I come back home after my trip to Korea and keep calling. Finally one component employee let's me know that they have actually put the search for my bag on hold because I hadn't returned the wrong bag. Mind you, this is over 2 months now and no one has ever mentioned this to me in my previous calls after the first call I gave them when they delivered the wrong bag. I told them that I have told a KLM representative to pick up the bag and they said that they would. They apologized and sent someone over and then a few days later my bag arrived. I have never been so stressed about travelling until this. I wasn't unhappy about them losing my bag, but was extremely frustrated with the KLM handled the whole situation. Each time I called, it seemed that the employee was more confused about my situation. My phone calls consisted of me asking them to open my case for the search which they said they would request their supervisor, but my case was only opened 2 months later. Each employee guaranteed the case would be opened, but it was all a lie. Communication is not a quality the company has within their team. My friend has also flown with them recently to visit me in which both of her flights got cancelled. No notification was given about these cancellations until the actual day of the flight and they also lost her bag on her way back home. I couldn't believe it when I heard that this happened.

Madrid to New York in Business class. A wonderful plane and seat. The seat went flat into a bed had many functions electrically went down into any position had a massage function and a footrest.

The seats were slim style but the pitch was noticeably less by about 2 inches and quite hard by the end of the 2.5 hour flight. Flight left on time and landed 15 minutes early. The cabin crew were smart and friendly, helping with luggage. The food selection was not inspiring but the rose wine was of good quality although not very cool.

I had read many reviews about delayed flights and other inefficiencies, but I wanted to experience it for myself. My two flights to CTG departed on time with no issues. While returning, my second flight was delayed by hours. The delay was due to the wrong plane being assigned. I explained to the associate my concerns because I would be missing my train and would either have to spend hundreds on a hotel or almost $80 on an Uber. The associate explained that nothing is in her control and that JetBlue would not be able to provide a voucher. Customer service was called and they stated the same thing. I ended having to get a hotel room for almost $200 and purchase another train ticket home.

"CMB-BKK-CMB. Beware of Thai Smile! I have to admit that I was not aware of Thai Smile before my experience on 23-26 Nov 2013. I booked my flight on the Thai Airways website the flights had a TG prefix and the confirmation email came from Thai Airways International. I deliberately chose Thai Airways as I wanted a quality of service better than the alternative of Sri Lankan Airways. The whole journey left me disappointed. I thought I was on a full service flight but obviously wasn't. The plane was new - but was incredibly uncomfortable due seat pitch and leg room. Staff are young immature and rather clueless about customer service. Food was nothing special. Thai Smile should be operated as a completely different airline and have a different prefix. I felt misled that I had booked a ""Low Cost Service"" whilst using the regular Thai Airways website. No where on the ticketing does it mention that it was Thai Smile service. I have flown Thai on many occasions and always been happy however now the reputation of TG has been shattered for me.

" San Jose to Fort Lauderdale. Spirit Airlines is horrible. I traveled with a group of 4. They delayed our flight from 1:12AM to 8AM without any reasoning. When calling the company, we were always redirected to a different person and nobody was able to help. Someone from Spirit gave us a number to call within the company, and when we tried to call, the number was not in service. When we went to the counter to talk to them in San Jose airport, no accommodations were made and everyone was expected to ""just sleep in the airport"". Passengers had to argue with airline representatives to even get a food voucher. Airline representatives were rude and unhelpful, and even lied to passengers faces saying that ""no hotels were available"" (even though we checked and many hotels nearby were indeed available) and saying that everyone's connecting flights were going to be rebooked. We had to argue and be persistent to be ensured that we had a connecting flight (even though they were so sure we did), and it turns out we did not have a scheduled connecting flight and had to be rebooked through another airline. Only one member of the airline was helpful in our entire experience. When we went to get our boarding passes, we overheard other customers being told that they were unable to get a connecting flight (even though the customers were assured that they had new connecting flights just a few hours before).

" Appalling food, absent staff and stinking toilets in business class - never again. We flew Business Class from Sydney to Casablanca via Abu Dhabi. We were looking forward to experiencing a flight on Etihad. As frequent travellers we like to try different airlines. The reality was horrible. Really bad food - on the really long journey I was served an egg white omelet on the first flight and some appalling canned pumpkin soup on the 2nd leg. No other food was offered. The staff seemed to spent most of the flight gossiping in the galley oblivious to passengers. By the time I was dumped into the awful waiting room at Casablanca airport I was hungry. The wines were not up to business class standard. The seat was uncomfortable - ditto with the 'bed' and the amenities pack sub-standard. The worst aspect of both flights were the stinking toilets. They really smelt bad. Please can someone get into the toilets with hot soapy water and disinfectant and clean them? Is this too much to expect in a business class cabin?

" Hostile ground staff at the gate. Very friendly, very senior cabin crew. Surprisingly (for Qantas) soft black seats showing evidence of previous meals and passenger hairs.

Or an apple. The other choice appeared to run out about half way down the cabin. Not surprising with green curry that early. One hour before landing given a frozen fruit juice ice block labelled ""made in China"". From an airline that rests on Aussiecentric marketing. At descent, offered a chocolate of a brand known to taste like soap. So nothing appealing to eat in over 4.5 hours. No seat back entertainment. Overhead screens glarey and barely visible, showing some superhero movie. Why is it you can fly Sydney - Melbourne and get unnecessary seat back entertainment often but never on a 4.5 plus hour flight to DRW.

" My family just traveled from Ft. Myers to Atlanta round trip on Delta. We purchased 5 economy tickets for 2 adults and 3 children. When we checked in for the first flight to ATL the counter personnel made a snide comment about our tickets being basic economy and how lucky we were to have seats in the same row. For this first leg we had 5 seats in row 40 with 1 other passenger between us. That was good and we had a fine flight. When I used the Delta mobile app to check in for our return flight to RSW, we were given 5 middle seats (737 seats b and e) throughout the plane. We didn't get 2 seats together. When travelling with children (9, 12, and 14) that is not disastrous, but still sucks. When I asked the Atlanta check in staff if there was anything they could do for us, that is when I really experienced how Delta feels about basic economy tickets. The check in person was very friendly and helpful until he saw what type of fare we had purchased. His demeanor and helpfulness completely changed as he informed us that our tickets were take any seat class. We went to customer service and received the same treatment, even after telling the rep the ages of our girls. At the gate we tried again, and this gentleman was even more discourteous. He told us he wouldn't even look to see if there were seats available for moving us. When we got on the plane (last - zone 4), several passengers saw our predicament and offered to move to accommodate us. We didn't ask them to. Nice to see there are good people flying on Delta even if the people running it are jerks. We fly often and usually on Frontier, Allegiant, Jet Blue, and Southwest Airlines without difficulty. No other airline has embarrassed me or belittled me for choosing to fly economy with them. Bottom line is, if you buy a published basic economy fare on Delta Airlines, be prepared to be admonished and treated like you don't deserve to be on their plane.",Detractor
" Kilaminjaro to Chicago via Istanbul. My problems began the day before the flight, I had booked a Turkish Airlines award business class ticket using United Mileageplus miles months earlier, but the day before noticed I couldn't select my seat and part of my flights were missing from the itinerary. I called Turkish Airlines to confirm everything was but for some reason I couldn't select my seat, so to arrive to the airport early. I arrive the next day to the airport 3 hours early in Kiliminjaro airport in Tanzania and it turns out there is a massive problem with my ticket. A Turkish airlines agent later said it was ""it was award ticket and NO REC on your onward boarding pass"""" which I have no idea what it means but the agent was smashing away at the keyboard for hours trying to get me on the flight to the point they had to hold the flight to Istanbul. At the very last minute I was finally I was able to board and the Turkish airlines agent said I shouldn't have any more problems, but once I get to Istanbul I need to get my next boarding pass and that my bag would arrive just fine to Chicago (both of these turned out to be false) Already having a bad day,I was informed that for the duration of the flight I would only receive economy service and meals despite booking a business class ticket. Once I arrived to Istanbul, more problems began as the transfer desks agents were extremely unhelpful just ping ponging me from one desk to the other with no agent willing to print my boarding pass or ticket. As it got closed to boarding time I told a transfer desk agent I'm not leaving until they print me my pass which I paid for and I was bound to miss my flight! In the end a desk agent in Istanbul wrote me ticket by hand 30 minutes before the flight was set to take off and told me to run! This ticket got me past security and it seemed everything was ok until I got to the gate and once again they denied me boarding, while they grabbed my passport and the agents again smashing on a computer keys trying to get me boarded. Then they tried to claim that my ticket was only economy until I showed them the receipt, at this point they were once again, holding the next plane up for me. At the very last second they finally let me board the flight to Chicago. Once arriving to Chicago I was once again greeted with more bad news. My bag had not made it so I asked them to ship the bag to Mexico City (where I live). They said I would need to pick it up at the airport ""the next day."" Well turns out the next day was a whopping 5 days later. When the bag arrived it was completely destroyed. The nightmare doesn't end there. I figured they would be quick to provide compensation over such an incident, especially over an expensive long distance business class ticket but was I wrong. Once I began the process I sent them all relevant details including pictures of my damaged bag, and receipts totalling about $500 for various purchases I had to make for the 5 days I didn't have my bag. Then they said that they couldn't pay me anything for my damaged bag because they needed a ""repair invoice"" when they originally said a financial request will suffice in lieu. At that point I had already thrown my damaged baggage away.",Detractor

" Singapore to Oslo via Helsinki. Pleasant experience with Finnair. The cabin was comfortable and legroom space was just nice for Asian height. They offered varieties of food, you can choose either western or Asian meals. The flight ticket price is average also.

MEL-SIN-MEL in January 2014 in Economy Class. Seats 39 (Aisle) on way up 34 (aisle) on return leg. 747-300 MEL- SIN the 380 on the SIN-MEL leg. Check in for this flight was very slow the flight was as a consequence 30 minutes late leaving with no apology for the delay. The plane on the way to Singapore (the refitted 747) was much more comfortable in my view than the A380. The refitted 747 is not as wide as the 380 the seats seemed to be more comfortable and certainly had better lumbar support. The service was faultless on the way up. The beverage service quite prompt and the inflight meal looked OK. A further snack was served about 1.5 hours prior to landing. The red-eye flight on the way back to Melbourne on the A380 was OK but not great. However the flight left on time the meals and beverage service was efficient and the meal was adequate if nothing special. The seat however was not comfortable - not enough lumbar support and I had back ache for some days afterwards. The blanket provided was of good quality and nice and warm. The crew were efficient as is usual for Singapore Airlines but not very friendly. One of the toilets in the economy cabin was made unavailable for passengers with no explanation as to why. Information given out by 2 crew members about the flight wasn't accurate - they said the arrival time would be 30 minutes earlier than the actual arrival time but in the end we landed on time. However we were kept waiting once we landed and had to stay on the plane at Melbourne airport. Very frustrating after a long flight. However overall having flown with a number of airlines Singapore Airlines is definitely probably one of the better ones. Both the ground staff and the cabin crew are relatively on the ball. There are loads of choices for in-flight entertainment although I wish they would make the headphones more user-friendly and comfortable to wear - after about a couple of hours they hurt my ears and I could not make them short enough to fit comfortably at all. The service is very efficient and the planes are pretty comfortable although I would not recommend the A380 for a long night flight.,Promoter
" Our group was returning to the US after two weeks of international travel. At the United terminal we endured an overbooked check-in with rude ground agents. Some of our group waited for seat assignments until the plane was almost fully loaded despite the tickets being purchased a year in advance. The inflight service was just as rude as what we experienced in the terminal. Air New Zealand (the service we used in Australia and New Zealand) by comparison was staffed with a pleasant, polite and accommodating in flight crew. United needs to revisit customer service training of their entire staff. Improvement is sorely needed. Very disappointed and dissatisfied!",Detractor

VIE-AMM-BKK Business Class (4-8 Jan./2015). I was quite satisfied with all flights on RJ. The flight attendants were friendly responsive and committed. The food was very good and the inflight entertainment offered a great selection. The flight back from BKK to AMM was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather conditions. People complained however safety first! The delay was compensated with a Dreamliner aircraft (B787) that is quite comfortable (flat bed). Boarding in VIE was for all passengers (business and economy) at the same time. If you are not offered a welcome champagne don't mind to ask for it. It was served after the take off. If you are served left over drinks from other flights (e.g. wine) ask for a new bottle to please your in mouth entertainment. I have observed unfriendly passengers and RJ staff responded well.,Passive

  Buffalo to Charlotte. Worst airline to fly with! This is now our second time this year for our flight to be delayed causing us to miss our connecting flight thus missing very important events that we paid a lot of money to be at. To â€œaccommodate usâ€ they gave us a 10% hotel discount for a hotel that was over $150 a night and sent us on our way. Absolutely unacceptable. And now that I'm reading the reviews I see that it's a very common thing with this company. Will never be flying through this Airline again and suggest you not to if you want to make it on time wherever you are going.,Detractor
  I flew jet blue to Orlando in July. The return segment was delayed for 3 hrs. Today September 4th I was traveling as a standby passenger and got booted off after boarding the plane. Due to weight restrictions and excess luggage issues. Another passenger volunteered to exit the plane so that I could make the flight. He did in fact deplane along with his wife and daughter. I was still asked to leave because of luggage problems. I then waited 2 hours for it to be returned to me. Then I was told that one piece of luggage was left back on the plane. So I was asked to deplane because of weight and luggage issues yet my suitcase left without me. Bravo jetblue. You have officially lost a customer.,Detractor
ATL-CDG 7/13/13 B777-300. Take off and landing on time etc. Nothing special or terrible to report. I thought the business class on Air France although not bad is also not good.

Terrible fish horrible cheese wine selection OK. Overall no reason to compliment or complain and given the ticket price I think I was just about getting value for money.,Passive
Air Canada are a disgrace. Flew from Vancouver to London. I was astounded at how little leg space there was for passengers and I'm short myself (5'6). It is simply impossible to get out of your seat if somebody is asleep. It is simply inhuman to put people into such cramped conditions for nearly nine hours. I don't know how they are allowed to get away with this. Are there no regulations governing minimum legroom on aircraft. You wouldn't transport animals like this.,Detractor

"  British Airways used to be better than this. I spent all afternoon in the Business lounge, waiting for my Gatwick flight at 7pm. My boarding card said the gate closed at 1840, and when I hadn't heard any announcement by 1830 I asked the BA man at reception if there was a delay. I was very dismayed when he casually said ""yes, about 1 hour 30 mins"". I was very unhappy they had not told us earlier, or asked if we needed help getting home in a more timely manner. There was a time when BA would have tried to reroute its premium passengers, but this man told me his duty manager had specifically told him not to do this. He told me that if I wanted to switch to an earlier LHR or LCY flight I would have to go back landside and buy a ticket for those flights. Onboard I had my first experience of BA's new club Europe, wherein the middle seat is covered by a tray, to give the perception of more space, without actually giving you a wider seat or more legroom. From my experiences of BA business class in both long and short haul, over the past year, it is very sad to see that BA is focussing on making changes which make it more money, rather than changes which benefit the passenger experience. My meal was plonked down in front of me without telling me what it was, and it wasn't at all tasty. But a stewardess gave me great customer service by giving me a plastic glass to decant my bloody mary into, so that I could hold on to it on approach to LGW. That was a very nice touch I hadn't been offered before on any airline I've flown with.",Passive

Flew Toronto to Punta Cana. I booked using Air Canada vacations on mistaken assumption that this would afford me a better seat due to star alliance status. Of my 1 million miles flown most international this is my first user review and this flight was the worst seat with the worst legroom that I have ever experienced.

"  First time I have been on a Ryanair flight flying from Nuremberg to London Stansted. Departure in NUE always is nice as the terminal is small and the ways short. As we had cabin baggage only I can't rate ground handling of Ryanair in NUE. The boarding for Ryanair is always efficient. I had to drop my trolley at the aircraft due to full cabin which was a bit annoying. Since you have seats assigned boarding is absolutely comparable to any other airline. Once in the cabin you need to get used to the strong colors. The seats are absolutely sufficient for the 1,5 hours to STN. Announcements had been in clear and understandable English. Take-off was on-time and the flight to STN was absolutely smooth with a safe landing in STN. As usual there is service against charge onboard as well as Duty Free. After landing the baggage was available at the baggage claim immediately and we left STN approx. 25 minutes after landing. Flight back to NUE was comparable. The crews on both flights were very nice the time you saw them. Ryanair is a great and safe way to fly.",Promoter

"I had more than 20 flights on Turkish in the last 15 months, both international (European) and domestic. Out of those flights, half of them were on time with the other half were delayed by about an hour - only one had a four hour delay because of weather. As long as everything goes right, TK is a pretty good airline, but as soon as something goes wrong, their disaster management is a disaster itself and as a passenger you're usually left with no information about what's going on. Besides that, ground services are pretty slow as well and sometimes you're waiting for more than half an hour at the luggage belt. Seats on the narrowbody fleet are mostly okay while those on the A330s are pretty uncomfortable (didn't try the B777 so far). Turkish Airlines inflight catering is excellent and oustanding compared to most other airlines. When changing planes either at AtatÃ¼rk or Sabiha GÃ¶kcen airport, allow yourself some extra connecting time as flights are often a bit delayed and baggage handling and immigration (for domestic connections) sometimes takes ages. That extra time also increases the chance your luggage will make it on the connecting flight too. To sum it up, I reccommend Turkish but you should also be aware of the possible drawbacks.",Passive

OSL-IST-AGP return February/March 2015. OSL-IST on B738 aircraft. Flight more than 80% full. Cramped seating in economy. I moved to a row of 3 vacant seats were I could sleep after the meal service. The same applies for the AGP-IST sector on B738 aircraft. IST-AGP on A321-200. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight was almost 100% full. My seat was in an emergency exit row and so the legroom was very good. The same applies for the IST-OSL sector A321-200 aircraft and seated in an emergency exit row. I had the option to travel for a slightly lower fare non-stop with Norwegian (from Gardermoen airport) or Ryanair (from another Oslo airport not Gardermoen) but I had to be at Malaga at a determined time of the day and when you factor in the luggage Turkish Airlines was then the most reasonable option.

Very rude, try to blame it on the customer, if you don't live in Slovenia and your only communication is over emails it takes 2 to 3 weeks for them to reply even if you send them email right after they sent one. That day they lost baggage for 3 different passengers and when we had our return flight there were two more passengers that said they lost their bags so this is normal for that airline.

"Unbelievably poor service, communication, and accommodation provided by the AA staff in Chicago. After delayed flight from Traverse City, MI, my flight from Chicago to San Diego was also delayed. Very little communication at the gate by staff, as we watched the monitor change the departure time over and over again. First a delay of two hours, then half an hour, then two minutes here, 10 minutes there and before you know it, the flight was delayed until 11 pm. This was extremely frustrating to be strung along for so long. At the very last second, the gate crew made an unintelligible announcement that our flight was being rerouted to LAX. This created chaos and provided only minutes for people to try and make arrangements at their final destinations before boarding and take off. Announcements were difficult to hear and brusquely delivered. On the plane, the crew was perfunctory and unhelpful. The reason for the rerouting was that the San Diego airport would be closed at midnight and we would not make it in time. I am sure the airline staff knew this and could have provided that information in a much more timely fashion than it did. Very disappointing to be treated with such disrespect, disregard and callousness. A bus was provided for the final leg to San Diego, making the trip a grueling all night, uncomfortable affair.

My family including my 3 year old daughter had a flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to Manchester which we had booked 8 months previous. We were unable to carry out an online check in before taking flight due to poor wifi signal at our holiday destination so arrived at check in 3 hours before our flight was due to leave to give us plenty of time. When we checked in we were told the flight was already full and we were placed on stand by. After waiting at gate for everyone else to board we were informed that only two seats were available and we could split up if we wanted or stay as a group of 3 on the next flight to Manchester.

We were charged Â£24 each. This was happening to everyone. Two passengers travelling separately both objected as they had travelled from Dublin to Bournemouth only a couple of days earlier with the same bags as hand luggage. It seems if we had made a scene we would not have been charged $8. Also another passenger on the same flight had a case that would fit under his seat and the steward had to remove it and put it at the back of the plane he was not charged for his bag either. On returning from Dublin to Bournemouth we checked in our bags thinking we had no option other than to pay (there are signs around saying pay up or leave your bags behind) and the check in girl said 'you do not need to check these in they are hand luggage.,Detractor
â Unverified | Geneva to Denver. Absolutely horrible. We flew United for an eight hour international flight to our home in Colorado. Seat cushion was not attached properly and was horribly uncomfortable. Seats were far too close together (compared with Air Canada and others) and uncomfortable. Seat screen malfunctioning (both seats in the row). Staff was unfriendly (presumably because of the unhappy passengers and poor quality of aircraft). Such a disgraceful airline. Clearly United doesn't care because this is just one of many poor reviews and the custom satisfaction rating is quite low. Choose another airline for a long flight.,Detractor
" We had planned a quick 4-day getaway thru Expedia with our two kids to Puerto Vallarta for spring break. The flight to Mexico was with Aeromexico (in partnership with Delta). We arrived at the MSP airport the morning of departure and the parking garage was full so we were directed to park at a different airport, which we did, but had to take two light rails and drag two kids and our luggage up and down countless escalators and long corridors before we reached the Delta desk to check in (nearly an hour later). We had checked in online the night before and just had one suitcase to check but due to the parking debacle we were told it was now too late to check in and we were sent to the Delta special services desk. We waited in line there and were eventually told that she couldn't help us either, that it was too late to check in and since we had booked thru Expedia we were told we had to call them. We found chairs at the entrance to the airport and started calling to see if we could get bumped to the next flight. After time spent on hold, Expedia told us we had to call Aeromexico, which we did but were told that their computers were down and so they would have to call us back. We were continuing to make calls to see if anyone at Delta, Expedia or Aeromexico could help when someone I knew entered the airport thru the entrance we were seated at. We came up with a â€˜Hail Mary' idea of consolidating our luggage into our carry-ons and sent our one big (now empty) suitcase home with her husband, who had just dropped her off at the airport. This allowed us to race thru security (having to dump a couple items we had neglected to remove in the haste of re-packing) and ran thru the airport to our gate, only to have missed the boarding cut-off by 10 minutes. We were sent to the Delta customer service desk and she too said she couldn't help us because we had booked thru Expedia. So we spent the next three hours on the phone attempting to get on either the next flight out or the same flight the following day. Initially Aeromexico told us that they could rebook us and that we would have to pay an extra $215 per ticket, but no one at Aeromexico seemed capable of completing that task. While my husband was on the phone with them, I was on the phone with Expedia and eventually was connected with a manager who tried to help by speaking with Aeromexico. In the two hours we were on the phone the news kept getting worse. In the end, Aeromexico refused to rebook our flights because even though we called them before we had officially missed the flight, they said that since we â€œno-showedâ€ they had since forfeited our return flights (which were actually thru Delta) and now, hours later, if they rebooked our flight to Mexico, there weren't any available flights to get us home. To add insult to injury, they refused to refund any of our $2900 for the flights that they had refused to re-book and wouldn't give any vouchers or credit for future travel either. Since we were canceling so late, we also had to pay for two of the three hotel nights too. I would not recommend flying with Aeromexico but I'm also disappointed in the service (or lack there of) provided by Delta. Though they partner with Aeromexico and have a help desk in the airport, they did absolutely nothing to help us!",Detractor

"  New York to Lisbon, returning Dublin to new York. The price, despite being in summer season, was excellent, especially in comparison to most other options. The level of service was the best we've experienced in many years of travel. It begins with the cockpit crew and attendants greeting passengers on entrance to and departure from the flights. They seemed more personable and enthusiastic than is common, and communicated pride and pleasure in their work. The food was surprisingly good and plentiful, free beverages were varied and frequent. We counted two passes with hot towels and four involving beverages. The entertainment options were fresh and divergent.Finally, we were forced to return due to a member of family's medical emergency. Delta could not have been more supportive and considerate related to this circumstance.

"  Flew Lufthansa from London Heathrow to Barcelona via Munich. Prior to boarding I visited the LH Senator lounge Heathrow T2. Like the lounge with it's elegant and warm design and the great views on the tarmac. As it was dinner time a very nice selvection of different hot and cold dishes was served. Lounge catering is Do&Co so taste of food was excellent. Lounge was a bit crowded but seats available for everyone. Priority boarding was offered and boarding was smooth. Was greeted by name and a drink was offered. I had ordered a special meal which was good in quantity and good in taste. Crew asked at least 5 times throughout the 1.5 hr flight if one wished another drink. The crew, as on most Lufthansa flights, was again exceptional. Always smiling, enganging and caring. In Munich arrival and departure from the very nice satellite terminal in T2. Senator lounge there as well very nice, but food offer did not compare with their LHR lounge. Onwards trip to Barcelona was as good as the flight from LHR. Slept the first half of the flight and upon waking up was immediately asked if I wished to have my dinner, which I gladly accepted.

Travelled Business Class on a 777 LHR-JFK. Very impressed indeed! Cabin spotless crew helpful. Seat wider than expected and quite private. Huge amount of space and loads of storage places too - even a large wardrobe. Power points convenient (UK and US plugs both fitted). Good noise cancelling headphones. Quiet. I was in 3A which is a mini-cabin just behind First Class - I would recommend it again. AA Business class is better than BA First Class Wifi: speeds of 3-7Mb which was commendable and only Â£9 approx. for the whole flight - very reasonable too considering the technology costs involved.

May 14th AA63. May 21st AA62. Paris-Miami Economy: the worst experience I have had for a long distance flight. I was lucky to get the seats with more space without paying as I was one of the last ones to check in. The airplane was so old that it is difficult to put a small bag inside the plane. What's more shocking is not having an individual screen for each passenger. moreover on the Paris-Miami flight the steward was not nice at all. While the hostess gave me a can of coke he only gave me a glass. The food was ok but very low quality compared to the price paid. On the return flight the food was just terrible no comment I did not eat it. Of course same thing on the return flight no screens and very old plane. The seat in front of me was all torn.

"Edinburgh to Lyon via Brussels, our first experience with Brussels Airlines and without doubt our last. I booked with this airline to ensure we had a maximum amount of time in Lyon, generally I would prefer a direct flight but arrival at 11am meant we could make the most of our time in the city. Delayed by 45 minutes on the outward flight, there was no attempt to allow people attempting to make connections priority exit from the plane. The airport is vast and because we were flying from a non-Schengen country to a Schengen, we had to travel between the A and B areas, and had to negotiate Security again, the only concession to our connecting Brussels Airlines flight was an 'express' pass which made no difference whatsoever. Boarding had been closed for a matter of moments when we arrived at the gate, we and a number of other delayed passengers were refused boarding. I know the constraints placed on airlines and pilots but the airline knew we were all booked on that plane and had been delayed due to their own airline's delay. We were then shuffled off to an enormous queue at the service desk, a poorly organised and somewhat shambolic affair. Eventually when we reached the front of the queue we were told they'd re-routed us via Munich, adding yet more time to our journey. We were delayed again on the return flight, I fully accept that there are matters outwith the carrier's control but there was no communication at the gate, very frustrating, particularly after the poor experience of the outward journey.",Detractor

" Chicago to Las Vegas. I booked a round-trip flight (as I do every year with American) from Chicago -> Las Vegas for the opening weekend of March Madness. My return flight was 8am on Monday March 25th. Right before boarding, the representative mentioned we would have a 15minute delay. Ok, not a big deal, this is typical with large airlines. 15 minutes later the representative then told us ""We're sorry, this flight has not been cancelled. Please call AA.com to choose a different flight at no extra charge."" As you would expect, all of the other flights out of Las Vegas on American were the next day. They wanted to switch my flight from Monday at 8am to Tuesday at 10am with a layover in Phoenix, arriving in Chicago at 10pm. (36 hours later ""free""). I called American Airlines and told them this was unacceptable and needed to be switched to a different airline since I had to work the next day. They said I could book through a separate airline and request a reimbursement. I chose to fly on a Delta flight that got me home around 11pm on Monday (8 hours after my original plans, not a huge issue). I then requested a reimbursement through American and they said ""We're sorry, if a flight is cancelled, please use a representative and we'll switch you to a new flight. Since you booked yourself, we cannot reimburse you."" I did exactly what they said and am now $600 out-of-pocket for a 1-way flight. I will never use American airlines again. I was a once Platinum Pro member with them, but this is a new low to me. Avoid at all costs. Delta and Southwest are significantly better. I will pay $50+ more for a flight that is not American moving forward. Hope this helps save someone a future headache.",Detractor
"  The cabin crew, bar one lazy individual, were excellent. T5 feels like a monopoly - Galleries Lounge food is simply appalling. Between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food. Unused hot food is removed at 9.30am sharp. Why not leave it ??? So all you have is bread and stodgy croissants. The upstairs of the A380 was in need of a serious clean. Cabin crew friendly, although you can sense lower morale. BA flights are often late now in my experience. The Club World A380 seats aren't comfortable. Despite everyone knowing, crossing over someone's legs too get out is still a nuisance. There is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing - I had one bloke shout at me when I'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly barge in.

Cabin crew were pleasant were quick to respond to requests. Seat is wide and feels spacious, yet for a bulkhead seat, a 9 inch IFE is quite small. Movie selection is diverse and kept me occupied for the 15-hour flight. Catering was consistent, flavours not bad. However, since the flight left Toronto in the afternoon, lunch was served right after takeoff, but dinner was then served midway through the flight instead of prior to arrival, which is slightly odd. None the less, flight departed Toronto and arrived Hong Kong ahead of schedule. Hong Kong to Bangkok on a 2-class A330. Contrary to the Toronto flight, this flight was full. Pushback in Hong Kong was on time, but it took such a long time to receive clearance for takeoff from HKG that the flight arrived Bangkok 20 minutes late. Not the airline's fault.

It felt both spacious and private. The crew were engaging and very friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The breakfast omelette was rather nice. IFE of a good quality but using the headphones was fiddly because you had to put on the sponge ear covers yourself! Seats are lie flat and quite comfortable-managed a nap of a couple of hours. The serving of lunch was delayed by some turbulence over the Atlantic. The Captain was very reassuring especially as he asked the FAs to be seated as well for about 30 mins.

It took me a while to realise (small letters which I find hard to read) that two were from the previous Sydney to Santiago and Santiago to Rio legs (on 11 June the Rio service was a special for the World Cup). Qantas certainly are well above the average and are different in many ways from other airlines. They try to be so different that they do not have a sign for the Business or First classes check in areas in Australia but instead there is just one in black that says Service.

" Doha to New York JFK. Excellent flight on a refurbished aircraft that has completely changed the business class travel experience on this route by creating a sense of big space while providing much needed privacy. On previous travel on this morning flight from Doha to JFK, the plane had a 2-2-2 open layout -- affording no privacy at all while being crowded, having to jump over a passenger if you were not on the aisle seat. Now, the new Q-Suite layout has changed all that. The configuration is 1-2-1, some seats face the back of the plane. There is a ""door"" that seals off your little cubicle equipped with all you need - plug and charge points, large pull out desk table to eat and work on, counters to keep your possessions, a hook to hang your coat, a cupboard for your footwear, reading lights, duvets, pillows, a large TV screen with numerous entertainment choices, and a seat that adjusts in many ways including lie flat. I was able to sleep several hours in absolute privacy in a window seat, 3A. The flight attendants are drawn from many countries of the world and they speak English well. There was a very large menu of food and drinks - cards listing them provided. Qatar provides meals and drinks on request throughout the flight. I am not partial to this form of service. One has to either call the flight attendant or go to the alley to place one's order -- they are delivered to your seat. Overall, the quality of the food is so-so but you are bound to find something that you fancy. Too much effort goes into laying the table cloth and the folded napkin across the waist and setting the place and cleaning it, time and again. Qatar is having an outsize impact on the environment by being so extravagant with their on-demand food and drink service. The flight was smooth and arrived on time.

" Baltimore to Boston. When trying to check in (not realizing I had boarding pass already on phone) tried to scan on machine, which kept reading not checked in yet. I went to an employee for help, she couldn't bother looking at my phone to tell me know the boarding pass was on my phone (if always printed out boarding passes) told her the machine kept saying we must check in first, she all she kept saying was get in line to check in for flight, Wouldn't even take the time to listen, that I had already checked in. We were returning from a memorial they had at the Vietnam Veterans site for all veterans that had passed away after arriving home from Vietnam. My husband had just passed away due to agent orange exposure and I was devastated and still confused because of his death. But this employee wouldn't listen at all as I tried to explain to her I had checked In already, along with my son and young grandson. She just kept saying get in line, where people were checking bags, we had no bags to check in with and by this time it was 5:15 and had to wait in line for over 45 minutes with people that were checking their bags. Running to security, then to gate ( I had hurt my back and have horrible sciatica down my leg) but my son ran a head and got to the gate at 5:55. The attendant told us the doors just closed and we were unable to board plane. So we missed our plane home after a very emotional 2 days, because an employee at the check in wouldn't take the time to look at my phone and explain I could use that for boarding pass and did not need to wait in line for 45 minutes. I will never use this airline again. Also now reading others experience with this airline ( should have known better when calling with questions before even leaving for this trip. The customer service for this airline is just as bad, no matter what button you press for a question. They also have NO discounts for families of Americans veterans, money is all that matter to this airline. Never again will I ever use this airline, no compassion, no help with questions from their customers. Horrible!!",Detractor
"  I will never fly United again and this is why. I was to depart Cleveland to Chicago on 26 November at 6:35pm. We did not leave the runway until 8:25pm for a fuel overfilling. I have never heard of such a thing! There 4 updates given and they were not timely and obviously they were not accurate. We arrived in Chicago at 8:38p. My connecting flight was to depart Chicago at 8:50pm and boarding stopped at 8:35pm. I asked several flight attendants if my gate could be called and I was told they couldn't control that. It seemed like I was the only person on this plane with that connecting flight. There were others going to Istanbul Turkey that United called ahead for them not to miss their connection. An announcement was even made that they didn't need to rush. When we landed in Chicago I had to run from gate B14 to E1. I have never run so fast, in heels, in my life. When I arrived at E1 the plane had pulled away. I was livid! I went to a customer service counter for assistance and was told there were no more flights leaving Chicago to Milwaukee that night and that I could take a bus. A bus? I didn't want to but I was ready to go home to say the least. The time then was 9:00pm. I was told the bus wasn't leaving until 10:45p and it was the last bus. Arriving Milwaukee at 12:30am. I inquired about my luggage and was given instructions on how to get it. After going to another service counter, I was able to get my luggage, 20 minutes later. The second service counter attendant told me the bus shuttle was right outside the door and to follow the red Bus Shuttle sign. She even pointed to a Coach bus going by telling me that's where I'd get on the bus. I hadn't been on a bus since I was 12 years old. She offered and gave $20 worth of food vouchers but I didn't use them. I was too distraught. I sat in the terminal waiting to go to the bus stop. At 10:15 something told me to go and find out exactly where I needed to stand. I asked an airport shuttle driver and he told me to follow him. He pointed to shuttles/buses that were across the street and about a 10 minute walk away! I had to run again, this time with luggage. As I entered the bus terminal there was no one available to ask which stop, 4, 5,6, etc, I was supposed to stand near. I asked the transit cop and he told me to stand at #4. I asked what time was the bus coming. He said the bus usually gets there at 10:30pm. My watch said 10:32p. He then said he must be running a little late. I didn't want to take any chances so I stool outside the terminal, right in front of the #4 stand, waiting for the bus. Once on the bus, the driver announced since this was the last bus of the night he had to wait an additional 10 minutes before departing. I arrived at the bus station in Milwaukee WI at 12:38am. For a travel trip that should not have been more than 50 minutes in the air, I ended up spending almost 9 hours to reach my destination. To say this is unacceptable is an understatement.",Detractor

While waiting at the gate, you announce they are overbooked and are asking for people to take alnerate flights - not sure which other flights are even available since they've already cancelled 5 and it's only 7.00am. Thankfully ours wasn't cancelled, but we're sitting on the plane, all boarded, when they tell us we are going to be stuck here an hour - on the plane - because we're ""waiting on a member from Denver"". I asked a flight attendant what that exactly means and she told me she has no idea. She said, ""I'm not sure what's going on, we're all here. Our crew is all here, I don't know why we can't leave"". All of this and Spirit is offering a $50 voucher to fly with them in the next 28 days. This has been our first and last experience with Spirit for sure.

Travelled with my husband sister and brother inlaw to Rome via Heathrow. Yep long flight so everyone kept reminding me when I told them where we were from. Decided to upgrade to Premium Economy and thanks to our travel agent got a good deal. Several years ago I was put off from flying British Airways so thought I'd give them another go. Wasn't disappointed all flights were good considering we flew straight through to Rome I felt pretty good at the end of 30 hours in the air. The Premium Eco seats had plenty of leg room on all flights 2 bags per person even the flight from Barcelona to Gatwick which we were very grateful for. Can't say the food was anything to rave about. When the food you are eating has been on the plane as long as you have it really can't be good. Overall the flights were really good on time easy pickup of bags etc. the only disappointment is having to pay for the allocation of our seats. Apparently this is now common practice. Just be upfront about it that's all. will defiantly investigate BA again though.,Promoter

I understand I can pay to get a seat I want but other than having a seat next to my husband I don't want any particular seat. We are travelling as a pair. There are three seats each side of the aisle. There will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting together as they don't know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit.

April 3 SIN-CGK Business Class - Air France has a very convenient eCheck-in option whereby you can elect to check-in automatically 30-hours prior to your flight (i.e. no need to manually do it online or via an app) and your boarding pass is sent to you automatically. I used this service for a SIN to CGK flight and arrived at the airport 90 minutes before departure. As I made my way through Immigration I was told to return to the AF check-in counter as the Immigration officials do not accept eBoarding passes for AF flights. Although this was slightly annoying I went to the AF counter. It looked like AF check-in counters were closing as majority of staff were packed up and only 1 counter was still open with a few pax in line. I asked a member of staff where the business class line was as it was not clear and was told that I can check-in using the kiosk. I did just that and received a boarding pass on thermal paper. I once again made my way to Immigration and this time was told that I could not go through Immigration unless AF has verified my documents. I tried to protest but ended up returning to the AF check-in counter again. All the counters were closed and all staff were gone. This was now 55 minutes before departure. In a panic I asked a member of Changi Airport Information Desk team if they could help me. They kindly tracked down the AF office number but there was no answer. A family had arrived by this time with 2 young children in the same situation as me: holding an eBoarding pass but not able to get through Immigration. One of the Changi Airport staff kindly went through Immigration to the Departure lounge and to the gate to approach the AF staff directly. She reported back over the phone that AF may not be able to let me board. 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure a member of the AF ground staff slowly made their way back to the check-in counter and handed me a 'proper' boarding pass and asked me to run to the gate or miss the flight. As she was checking that my passport was in order she told the family of 4 that they could also run to the gate and try and make the flight but there was no way their luggage would be flying with them that day. Looking back at no point during the check-in process (a) the reminder email to check-in online (b) the online check-in or (c) when using the kiosk to check-in - at no point was there ever a mention that the eBoarding pass or the boarding pass on thermal paper was not enough to check-in for the flight. The member of staff who directed me to the kiosk did not mention this either. I was very lucky that the Changi Airport staff kindly helped me but I feel sorry for the family with 2 young kids who I know was denied boarding even though they - like me - followed all the steps required by AF regarding online check-in. This experience alone has taught me NOT to fly AF from Singapore Airport under any circumstances.,Detractor
"London Heathrow to New York JFK return with Kuwait Airways. Let's start with punctuality, 2hr delay on the first leg to JFK then 1hr delay on second leg 5 days later back to Heathrow. On the second leg we were given no information about the delay or how long it was expected to be - even the Pilot was standing around 20 minutes with his crew before they left. Once your plane arrives late you all form a queue. Then they call seats x to x which causes chaos as the orderly queue becomes a push and rush to the front everyone trying to board even if their rows not called this is known as a 'bottleneck'.

Brisbane to Guangzhou Guangzhou to Amsterdam in April 2014 returning after 7 weeks away travelling Guangzhou back to Brisbane. My wife and I couldn't rate it higher. The plane seemed new seats good reservation of seats were made early and honoured when checking in. Staff were excellent. Meals were nice and plentiful. We did find the air-conditioning a little hot. This probably is hard to get right as some may prefer the warmth. The aircraft was full on all sectors and we were surprised by the lack of Australians travelling. English isn't the first language of the crew and for some crew it may not be one that they understand well. But that wasn't a barrier as our command of China's languages is zero. We had a smile when offered pasta for breakfast coming in to Brisbane. To our surprise it was a lovely warm omelette hash brown sausage etc. If this lack of English would offend some travellers then maybe they shouldn't travel at all. Our meals were lovely with fruit fresh. We enjoyed any little surprise because both we and the staff didn't always communicate well. The transit in Guangzhou of 7 hours was long on our trip to Amsterdam but this isn't a fault of the airline. Guangzhou Airport has a place where you can get free hot water. If you have tea bags or coffee you can fill up your thermos and have a hot drink as often as you want. It saves on high hot drink prices at the airport. We were surprised how popular this hot water dispenser was and so well used during our transit time. I hope your China Southern journey mirrors our experience.,Promoter

"I couldn't store my stuff in front of my seat on this Cathay Pacific Airways flight. I'm quite short, so struggled to get to my bags and important items - my phone fell out of my bag in the overhead compartment, which was a big problem. Lots of things weren't working in my designated seat. Sound stopped working, the remote didn't come out at the side of the armrest, and when I wanted to watch something halfway through my flight (which was 13 hours), the screen went black - even if I wanted to put the map on! My family couldn't check in online as we booked with our travel agent, and as a result, we sat rows apart. Food and service wasn't that good. I really did not enjoy the flight back home after a fun holiday.",Detractor
"  Hong Kong to Munich via Abu Dhabi. Not what I expected. Aircraft was OK, as with most A330's/A340's with 8 seats abreast. Lighting was good, it has different colour of lighting that is dimmed enough to create a lighting environment to sleep, and the other good thing is that the lights are pretty much always dimmed. IFE had good movies, live TV on the HKG legs which was pretty cool. What's really bad about IFE is that it doesn't turn on until like 30 mins after take off, and it shuts down well over 30mins before landing. It's 2016, I thought airlines could manage better. What was also below expectation was the flight attendants. The AUH to MUC leg was the best, I felt like attendants were happy and cheered up, but the others I felt like I shouldn't bother them for anything, they just don't smile. One occasion there was a slight misunderstanding in what drink I wanted - no worries I just asked again, in a friendly way, but the response was ""you said you wanted xxx"" in a frustrated expression.",Passive
"Flight from ADL-MEL is only a short flight but flying with a premium airline like Qantas Airways is the way to do it before christmas to make sure you get to your destination. Check in was easy, with the new procedure of enter details in via the accessible computers available to customers. Printed out boarding passes and baggage tags and took bag to bag drop counter. Very easy. Airline boarded fast, row 26D, good seat. The new addition of the in-seat tv's are great. Select anything you wish for, and used the in-seat messaging service which was great with a friend sitting 4 rows away. Was a lunchtime flight, shame no wines only softdrink and juice or tea/coffee but meal was good. No complaints as seat was comfortable and well padded given I have soft tissue injuries.",Promoter
"Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. Dubai won't allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. This I found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough I needed the liquid. I tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. Never before have I pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. Hardly enough to keep well hydrated. When disembarking I spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy I could have used, had I been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me - the perils of the window seat.

YVR-LAX. Flight AC558 Oct 28 2013. We choose Air Canada to fly to YVR for our 5 days vacation - first and last time. Worst customer service we received. They changed the timing of the plane without notice and when we got to the airport all they could tell us is that they sent us an email and if we didn't get it then it wasn't their problem. Manager was called to help us but after listening to our problem he told us that we could pay $75 per person if we want to go on an earlier flight. First of all they change the flight timing without notice and then instead of help all they show is attitude.,Detractor
We paid about $2400 each for a nonstop Premium Economy ticket from IAD to NRT because the thought of cramped quarters in Economy for 14 hours to NRT and 12 hours back to IAD put us off. While I cannot complain about the quality and comfort of the seats - we had footrests seat width was spacious decent amount of pitch nice armrests so both you and the person next to you both had plenty of elbow room - the service was not that great. On the way to Narita we were served shortly after being airborne but it was 9.5 hours before we were offered any sort of food again. Sure the flight attendants would come by offering green tea or coffee but not even a lousy bag of pretzels? The same thing happened on the way back - fortunately we brought snacks with us so we were more prepared but it was still uncomfortable. If I'm paying twice the price of the economy ticket (which Premium was in this case) you would think we would have received at least a few more snacks than Economy. It was an uncomfortable experience. I doubt if we would fly ANA again because of it.,Passive
Excellent trip - 11 Sep from Chicago to Dubai via Amman in Crown Class. Check-in quick with friendly agents - given pass to Air France/KLM lounge in Chicago. Plenty of food and drinks literally next to the departure gate. Boarding priority for Crown Class - directed to my seat on the A340 by friendly FA from Romania. She and the Purser continued excellent service from take-off to landing - friendly and personable. Only 1/3 full so lots of space - older style seat but so much room! You basically had 5 aircraft windows of space when reclined. Food service old-style - on a cart for each passenger to be serviced individually - very classy. Quality and quantity of food excellent. Entertainment was ok - they need more options for films and TV shows. Arrived 1 hour early into Amman - transit in the lounge - more high quality food. Dubai flight was full A321 - again great service and excellent food. Landed on time and bags were out relatively quickly. I look forward to my return flight back to Chicago.,Promoter

"  Guangzhou to Melbourne. They're a lot better than Air China! Cynics might argue that's not saying much, but for anyone who has battled with the po-faced indifference of Air China, I would encourage you to give China Southern a try. The service was excellent and staff friendly, and English skills were generally good. On our inbound flight to Guangzhou, for travellers connecting to other flights, the airline supplied many staff to help negotiate the messy rabbit warren that is Guangzhou Baiyun Airport. On the return flight to Melbourne, the plane was delayed several hours by weather, and staff kept up a steady supply of drinks, food, and information to keep passengers satisfied. The only criticism I have, similar to some others, is what might diplomatically be called the ""adequate"" food. It was mostly fairly uninspiring meat-and-rice dices, although the Mediterranean style chicken (Western option) wasn't too bad. Perhaps an area they could improve a little. Otherwise, I was very satisfied with China Southern. Would recommend, especially over Air China.",Promoter
"By far the worst experience I have had with an airline. Flying United Airlines from Melbourne to Mexico through LAX, the flights were delayed for 6 hours. Had a similar experience on the way back and United lost our luggage! The customer service is rude and unhelpful. While waiting in the long line for customer service at LAX I overheard one of United's customer service agents joking about how she directed one customer to take the long way around the airport to intentionally cause him grief. My advice is to do anything you can to avoid flying with United Airlines. The small amount of money you may save with them is not worth the trauma. This is an airline offering the poorest quality service they can get away with.",Detractor

A crew member came up and told me I was wrong (I wasn't) and demanded I should take the seat behind it (48D in my opinion). I didn't argue. Then of course a passenger who had booked 48D came up. The same steward suddenly explained to me that I am plain wrong and that 47F in fact was 47D. It took 2 other crew members to convince the steward that I was right. Unbelievable! A crew that is not acquainted with seat numbering! Horrible food, 3 Euros for headphones on an intercontinental flight. Of course my steward did not issue the immigration forms before landing, so customs took additional time.",Detractor
This was my first and last time with American Airlines. Booked with British Airways from Dublin to Orlando. Flight out was fine as it was with BA but return was with AA - as they are partners of BA I thought the service would be the same. How wrong I was - flight was 2.5 hours delayed which meant we missed our flight from Dublin to Glasgow. I had to pay Â£190 to rebook flights. We were only allowed 1 checked bag each but with BA we were allowed 2 each. The stewardesses only came round once with drinks service and you had to pay for spirits. Plane seemed old. No inflight entertainment system in the back of seat instead TVs that came down where everyone had to watch the same film. No leg room at all. Very narrow seats that were extremely uncomfortable. I never complain about anything and when I read the reviews before our flight I thought they were exaggerated but honestly it's the worst flight I have ever been on and I wouldn't fly with them again even if it was free.,Detractor

" Lufthansa CityLine uses this aircraft type frequently on the MUC-BRU route and others and it is to be avoided. The cabin is the most uncomfortable IÂ´ve experienced, the seats are so narrow you have to squeeze yourself into them. Also, no business-class fast-lane security in MUC despite the fact that this is being advertised and included in the price for a business clas ticket. The quality of the food on this flight was rather sub-standard, announcements in German and English only, no French or Flemish.

"  I normally fly BA to Europe, but since their service has apparently gone sharply downhill as of this year (their catering has virtually disappeared and their reviews here on Skytrax are truly appalling), I thought I'd try Air Canada again. Flew from Toronto to London Heathrow / Geneva. The check-in/bag drop at Pearson was terrible. I arrived 2.5 hours before the flight and there was a long line that barely moved. It took an hour before I got to a desk. Typical case of lots of desks available but less than half were being used. Not acceptable for a full long-haul flight. The aircraft to London was a B777. I knew that AC had reconfigured these planes to squeeze 10 instead of the previous 9 seats per row. And I'd heard that the seats were hard and uncomfortable. And they are! Fortunately the seat next to me was free, but even so, it was pretty tight and I could not get comfortable all night. AC uses these aircraft on 16-hour flights to Asia and Australia, which must be unbearable. However, the IFE system is modern with an excellent selection of movies/entertainment, and good screen quality. The catering is standard and decent enough, certainly better than AC Rouge, BA or Air Transat these days. Lots of water runs throughout the flight, which were appreciated. My return flight was from Geneva on an older A330. Overall this was a good thing: the seats were wider and more comfortable, with proper cushioning and excellent leg-room. The IFE system was dated, though, and the selection not as good, but still adequate. The catering was again decent enough. All in all I would fly Air Canada again to Europe for direct flights. It seems to be one of few airlines to still offer a good, traditional service for a fair price.",Passive
"Excellent flight and no complaints even though we were delayed due fog at Gatwick. The pilot kept us briefed as to what was going on and the cabin crew looked after us. I was however dismayed by the BA agent that dealt with our check in at Venice. We were first in the queue when check in opened and a supervisor asked us to go this woman, from the outset she was not happy. We were a party of 8 and she only wanted to check in 2. She was difficult and surly throughout. She told us we could not sit together and dotted us around the aircraft. This would have been accepted had she not insisted that an infant in our party had to sit with a 15 yr old boy and not with its mother. We then asked the supervisor to intervene and guess what we were all seated together so it was possible all the time. By the time we had been checked in the whole of the rest of the plane had been checked in by the 2 other staff. This was a dreadful agent representation of BA, the UK's flag ship airline. I feel BA need to know how their passengers are treated by agent staff. I have not included this experience in my rating of BA. Once through check-in the flight experience was excellent.",Promoter
"  Hamburg to Bangkok via Paris CDG. HAM-CDG on Inter-European route nothing expected but was pretty surprise. Flight on time but information with apologize from captain that due to European air traffic control the flight to Paris would be 30 minutes longer and the express transfers were arranged by AF at CDG for those passengers with short transit.Service on Board a tasty croissant stuffed with cheese with complimentary wine! After arrival at CDG I saw AF Ground staff at the aircraft's gate with the â€œshort transitâ€ poster. It seemed that AF had arranged the express transit assistance. CDG-BKK boarding a bit chaotic because there was no priority boarding for those passengers who sat at aft zone of aircraft and everyone wanted to board the aircraft accordingly. Therefore the aircraft gangway were blocked by passengers who seated at the front zone putting their handbags into the overhead bins. Cabin-Crews were aged but very friendly and professional, helping passenger putting their handbags into the bins to avoid the traffic jam at gangway. Flight full on Boeing 777-300 with cramped 10seats / row therefore nothing to say about the seat comfort except the small footrest. AF is one of the few airlines which provides the seat footrest for Y passengers. Flight 30 minutes delay (due to chaotic boarding?) After taken off a hot towel was given followed by beverage service with nuts. 1 hour later hot tasty dinner was served with red wine in mini bottle and other good selection of drinks. After dinner most of FAs were gone and only one FA was on duty at each galley but self-service bar with soft drinks and ice cube was open throughout the flight. Excellent IFE with wide selection of music and movies in a variety of languages but limited new movies were available. During the rest time ice cream was served by the 2 FAs who were on duty. 2 hours before landing hot towel is given and hot tasty breakfast (with no choice) was served.

We always flight Thai first on long haul to the far east and until this flight have always been impressed with the staff service levels. However on this occasion they were: a) down one member of staff and b) used a staff member who had only worked in first twice. Thai cannot have provided her with any training so although she made every effort she had no idea how to serve dinner or drinks and was nervous and unsure throughout the cabin service. The Flight Manager explained that Thai now have a policy to shuffle staff between all classes and all aircraft types. That in itself is fine but please guys - do some training first! No wines offered with dinner (we had to ask and were brought an open bottle - no choice) No proper pre-dinner drinks service main courses were forgotten so we were offered fruit and cheese after the starter the wrong menu was used (we had pre-ordered) orchids were missing from the suites vases mix and match pyjamas long delays in clearing the tables so we had to ask for it to be done eventually. I still will recommend Thai unless this happens again next time.

" Houston to San Jose via Denver. We actually didn't fly. In Houston, we ran into a situation were all lanes of traffic were blocked. My husband had dropped his Driver's License in the San Jose International Airport, who'd sent us a picture and told us to arrive early for our return flight for extra screening on our return flight. Since the lanes were blocked, and there was no way around that, we pre-boarded while stuck on the road. After advising TSA that we would be late for our flight soon, they went into sloth-mode, calling a supervisor who didn't appear for 10 minutes. My husband provided the necessary alternative forms of ID listed on TSA's own requirements, and they proceeded to pat him down, etc. We ran, arriving at the Frontier gate to board 12 minutes before our flight was to depart. We were told the gate would close 10 min prior. There were no employees at the desk, and there was no way to reach them. We ran to the next gate and asked what to do. They told us to knock on the door to the gangway. We pounded on the door until we saw our plane take off. Then the employees came in, and we explained our situation. They offered to fly us out 2 days later. That was all they would offer. It took 2 minutes for them to make that decision, and they said they had no sister airline to accommodate us sooner. We offered to fly into San Francisco or Oakland. Still, they said, they had nothing. I called their call center at 5.40am, and spoke to another country who had nothing to offer, and didn't even check to see if there were earlier flights. This airline clearly wasn't trying to reschedule us, and did want to keep our money, which is what they did do. It doesn't behoove them to accommodate us, because they already have our money.

Toronto Pearson - Helsinki - Stockholm and Copenhagen - Helsinki - Pearson. It was clear from check-in at Pearson that in order to offer lower fares they've cut corners. We were there 3 hours ahead of check-in and even though we had done online check-in the process took 50 minutes. They informed us that our carry-on suitcase that met all of the carry-on requirements could not be taken as a carry-on and must be checked. Given that we had one carry-on between 2 people this hardly seemed fair. Flight was like any other cheap charter - no leg room and limited service. Flight from Copenhagen was similar but the check-in process was worse - they open the check-in 2 hours prior to boarding and we made it to the gate with minutes to spare.

"Slow check-in in Beijing. Used the Air China Business Lounge which is consistently disappointing. Flight was ready to leave the gate on time but ATC had grounded all flights due to pending thunderstorms. The captain did a stellar job keeping the passengers informed while we waited on the tarmac for 4 hours. The crew served water, juice and snacks during this time. Once airborne, the service was prompt and FA's generally friendly although a couple of them appeared to be annoyed and uninterested in their job. Dinner and breakfast were OK with reasonable number of meal and drink choices. The pods are at the end of their service life with cushions becoming inadequate for restful sleep. IFE content was mediocre and sound quality was poor. Due to the lengthy delay in Beijing, I missed my connection but the wonderfully polite and helpful agent who took my call at AC's Concierge Desk had me secured on the very last flight out and even had my boarding pass delivered to the arrival gate in Toronto.

Recently flew from MNL-SIN-DEL. MNL-SIN on a fully loaded B777 the aircraft is up for retirement but it is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The IFE was ancient but for such a short flight I did not mind it. Food was decent and cabin crew were as efficient and reliable as one should expect from SQ. Had a 6 hour layover in Changi which is without a doubt SQ's best asset. It's an airport beyond compare and would not mind a longer layover. Flight to DEL on the A380 with less than 100 passengers. Cabin crew were very laid back and allowed passengers to move about the cabin. The seats were extremely comfortable and food was excellent. Service calls were answered in record time and while one of the flight attendants was a tad cold one of the lead flight attendants embodied professionalism and warmth which made up for it. IFE kept malfunctioning and the movie kept pausing every 30 seconds or so which was annoying. Besides that one minor issue I would fly SQ again.

" On Sept. 2nd we were supposed to depart from PDX to DEN at 7:29pm, but due to and I quote the Captain of the plane ""Had a flat tire, but we couldn't get a maintenance person to the change the tire, then after he changed the tire he realized he had to change both tires if he changes one, but then he couldn't find another tire"" we didn't depart until after 1:00am. Our connecting flight from DEN to CVG departed on Sept. 3rd at 12:25am, so we missed that flight, but was rebooked prior to departing from PDX, for a flight that would leave September 4th at 12:30 am. We were also given a hotel voucher prior to departing from PDX, and were told we could stay there until our flight from DEN to CVG. Upon arriving at the hotel at 7:00am (After traveling for almost 24hrs straight) We were told we had to leave the hotel by 11:00am, we called Frontier for help, and they told us ""to go back to the airport and talk to customer service"", which was out of the question. I asked for a number to call the airport, and they don't even have a number to contact them. We never checked into that hotel, but instead had to go check into another hotel. I called into Frontier customer service late afternoon the next day on Monday Sept. 3rd, to explain the situation again, but was told us they do not handle refunds and I have to go talk to airport customer service. They gave us 2 $50 vouchers, which I told her we didn't want because we will not be flying with you all again...when I got to the airport that evening I went straight to customer service at the check in. I had Frontier employees just walk away from me and tell me they couldn't help me (Including the supervisor) I then went to the customer service next to where we board the flight, and they told me ""they would've never given a voucher like that, and that I should go back to Portland and talk to them there"", that they don't handle these type of situations, told me it shows online that I settled for 2 x $50 vouchers and finally gave me the same number to call that told me to go to the airport. I am very much paraphrasing all that your employees told me, as it was absolutely dumbfounding how they talked to and treated their customer(s).",Detractor
"  I got a ticket from Strasbourg to Athens via Frankfurt return. This includes a Lufthansa Express bus on the SXB-FRA-SXB segments. I missed the SXB-FRA segment, and got to FRA (200 Km) with my car, 2 hours before the flight and with a valid boarding pass. However, while trying to board the plane, I was denied entry and I was informed that all the rest of my segments were canceled, including return from ATH. They argued that I missed the 1st segment (the bus) and when I complained that this is only a bus, they said that they treat the bus the same as the plane (keep this in mind). They wanted me to buy a new ticket, because my ticket was not rebookable and then see when I would fly! After much grief, they allowed to board",Detractor
"We arrived at LAX (4 adults), and headed for the shared lounge for Premium reservations. The atmosphere was relaxed and classy, the food was excellent. We boarded the plane and were immediately greeted by cabin staff offering refreshments. The seats did not incline flat, but far enough to send me to sleep. The seat foot rest for my wife and I did not work on both legs of the flight and there was no WiFi once we took off. The entertainment screen was relatively easy to negotiate with plenty to keep you occupied. The food was tasty as airline food goes. The spacing between the seats was good but someone trying to exit a non aisle seat when the person in front has their seat reclined was a challenge. The return flight was delayed about an hour but the pilot made up the time but at LAX they did not have a Gate available, so we sat in the plane for about 40 minutes. Premium tickets were cheaper on Norwegian than Virgin Atlantic Premium Economy and Gatwick is my preferred Airport in London. Two of our group of 4 returned to LAX a few days ahead of my wife and I and their flight was delayed about 3 hours or more. The shared lounge at Gatwick is not very good, not enough staff to clear up the tables and the choice of food was not as goos as at the LAX lounge.

"  Chengdu to Shanghai. I have not flown China Eastern since 2009 because I had such a bad experience with it. I decided to give it another go, and was handsomely rewarded for this largesse with the worst experience I have ever had in a business/first seat. I showed up to the airport and had 15 minutes to kill in the lounge. The hostsess meets me at the door and physically bars me from entering, saying that my flight is going to board early. I know this is utter nonsense, because I have never seen a China Eastern flight take off on time, much less early. I then explain to her that I have bad knees, and that I may need assistance to get to the plane on time if they are boarding early. I ask if I could catch a ride on one of the electric vehicles. She flatly refuses me, and after I asked why, she said it was a 100RMB charge if I did. I get to the gate, early, and of course, they are not boarding early. I wait 15 minutes again, and the counter person directed me to get in the back of the line for coach after I showed her a first class ticket. They boarded late, as I knew they would, and then upon getting on the bus, driving around the airport, we walk up the rickety steps to the plane. And no drinks for first class passengers - the flight is too short, the flight attendant tells me, followed by ""maybe just this flight"", and the worst meal I have ever had on a plane. On landing, we start down a jetbridge, and I think, great, we get a reprieve from the stairs. Nope. Halfway down the jetbridge, we are directed down more rickety stairs to another bus, even though the airport is literally five feet away. I give one star only because -4 stars is not possible.",Detractor

"Korean Air totally screwed me on my last flight. I purchased my ticket online through their website and for some reason they put my name in backwards for one half of the flight the (half going out). When I got to the airport they wouldn't let me check in at Alaska Air. When I called customer they told me that the name couldn't be changed and that all the flights were booked (thanksgiving). I was left sitting with my wife and 9 month old son in the ticketing terminal for 3 hours on the phone with customer service until we eventually missed our flight. You would figure that after all that they would be willing to help get us on a flight the next day (or the next week) but instead they only gave the option to cancel the ticket outright with a $200 cancellation fee (for each ticket, $400 total) that they claimed they had no ability to waive. All of this is in addition to the issues we had just getting the tickets to even complete on their website. For some reason adding an infant to the reservation causes the reservation to charge the card then cancel the ticket. It took over 5 hours with customer service just to get the tickets purchased correctly. Even after all of that customer service time they still made an error with my name. I flew with Korean Air 3 months ago and do not have this many issues. But thanks to my horrible experience and the horrible customer service, I will never fly with Korean Air again. My trip was totally ruined because of them. If you are someone reading this and choose to use Korean Air I would highly recommend booking through a third party site like Travelocity or Priceline to avoid their awful website and awful customer service.",Detractor
" Corfu to Stansted. I feel Ryanair has lost it's appeal over the past year or so. On this recent return trip to Corfu, flights are generally delayed to some extent. Previously we always found Ryanair to be very efficient in terms of keeping to departure times. However, boarding process and splitting people up has caused chaos on board. I can understand the theory behind thir policy, and personally, for an extra couple of â‚¬ I would reserve seat together. But a lot of people still take pot luck, get seats allocated apart and then try throughout the boarding process, taxi, after take off to persuade others to change seats in order that they can sit together. Middle seats being allocated in premium seating (extra leg room, front seats that others pay â‚¬15 for). Their boarding process needs to be more streamlined as well, example, boarding at Corfu for Priority, no signs etc. to indicate where to queue. Got through gate, only to be held outside, busses arrived, but for some reason we were not allowed on them for 10 minutes, then a free for all with non-priority and priority getting on buses together. In reality, if another airline is similar in price I would chose them now over Ryanair as the whole travel process has become more chaotic, which is a shame, as with a few improvements and a bit better organisation not costing any money, it could be a far better experience.",Detractor
"The check-in staff at Geneva Airport are the worst and the queue for passenger already checked-in is way too long.

It's good, and service is done quite fast so passenger can get some sleep.

" Very full flight on G-BNLP/B747 flying from Miami to London. According to BAsource.com this plane was built in 1990. Obviously, since then it was not refurbished. Felt like a teenager again. Worn seats, cracks in the walls and dirty. Additonally, the IFE did not work. At the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment. As the night approached, crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights. No IFE and no book reading possible. Crew were young and friendly, but obviously not experienced. Took 2.5 hours until we had our meal after take-off - they skipped our last four rows. Only after inquiring we got a tray. On arrival, new contractor at Terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available.

"  Hamburg to Bangkok via Helsinki. HAM-HEL short flight of 2.00 hrs. operated by NORRA Air, no service expected, and got no service. Free of charges are only coffee, tea, water and blubbery juice. If you required a 0.33 ltr. of Cola you have to pay 3 Euro for (= 10.50 Euro/ 1 litre!). Flight was on time. HEL-BKK on new A350-900, nice cabin, top lighting, quieter than A330/A340 versions or B777. The interior clean, modern, fresh with beautiful LED lights, but missing the electrical window shade as fitted in B787. Seats 3-3-3 layout wider and more comfortable than B787 or 10 seats/row in B777, however missing the footrest. Sitting at the last middle rows which is in front of the two aft-toilets and there was no Overhead bin because the space over the 5 last middle seat rows at the end of cabin is used for overhead crew rest areas. Dinner 2hrs after departure the service was very slow. We sat in the last row in the middle and had to breathe every smell of board kitchen but we got the meals and drinks at the last. Of course as last persons there was no choice of meal. Very disappointed with meals and beverages / Quality and Quantity was poor and bad. Only small quantity of chilli-con cane as hot meals is not acceptable for long haul flight. Soft drinks (incl wine and beer) was offered only with meal service. If you are still hungry you can buy the snacks and drinks on board or if you require the drinks (except Water) during the flight, please pay. IFE on A350 was excellent but at the beginning there are always advertisements for Duty Free. Almost all films are available in Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and Thai. Cabin crew (Finns and 1 Thai) were friendly and enthusiasm with their new A350 (but very slow in meal service) and were trained to refuse politely if passengers needs drinks during the flight. Before landing we got a warm wet towel to refresh (same as after take off) and again small and bad quality of continental breakfast (this time no choice for everyone). Always remember to avoid the last middle row! These 3 seats are the worst seats of all.

They never made an announcement about the cancelled flight until well after the anticipated boarding time. When we approached the front desk we were told that the flight is cancelled and we were transferred to a later flight. Staff said if they made an announcement then it would create a commotion. It makes no logical sense. I said lots of people are probably still waiting for the announcement. Fast forward to the plane ride: the most shoddy plane ride ever. I've flown with many airlines - even down to tiny airlines like Air Timor. This has got to be the worst plane I've flown. The backs of our seats could not be controlled and went up and down just by leaning on it.

Lufthansa, in consideration of my wife in a wheel chair, sat us in the Upper Lounge (First Class passengers). Thank you Lufthansa! The lounge atmosphere is bland and uninviting. Not a cozy place to kick back for any period of time and bright sunlight invades the entire lounge. The bill of fare is below United Clubs. Boarding was somewhat hectic but moved quickly once it commenced. Business class was not full. ANA seats business 4 across, in a staggered figuration one on each bulkhead and two in the center. Everyone has aisle access without disturbing his or her seat neighbor. In-flight entertainment was average and offered normal selections. There is a handy power outlet for charging your devices. The seat configuration is excellent with on the deck storage for small items. The tray pullout is world class and I haven't experienced anything near as useful on any other airline. Seat controls are located on the side and were difficult to operate. I did not find the seat comfortable and the key element missing was the ability to raise my feet and legs, ie. recline. The seat was roomy and I found the seat tracking (forward/reverse) helpful. The cabin was hot for those on the sun side of the aircraft as there is no overhead air outlet. A free 15 minutes period of wi-fi was provided with additional time available at a reasonable cost. The food was mediocre with small portions. Desert was disappointing and snacks almost non-existing.

" Purchased a very cheap ticket (less than USD600) for Taipei to Madrid via Beijing, returning from Paris. While this was not the best airline I have flown, I got there and back on time and safely. All flights arrived early or on time. Boeing 787 was a comfortable aircraft but nothing special, while the older A330s were less so, but still acceptable. I had no major issues, although I may just have been lucky. It seems most of the bad reviews are due to delays or cancellations and lost bags (which I was lucky not to experience). The food was quite average but edible, although mostly Asian style so might not suit those who are not used to eating average quality Chinese food. It's true that the staff and attendants don't speak good English so you might also have issues there (I speak some Mandarin) and the in-flight entertainment is not great (bring a book or tablet). Also, facilities such as immigration, security, signage etc at both Beijing and Shanghai airports are poor, and while these are not the fault of the airline, they affect the customer experience. In summary, if you get a cheap ticket and remember how little you paid when you fly, you can probably consider Air China worthwhile. If you can afford to do so, you should probably fly another airline to avoid the risk of running into issues.",Passive
"  Berlin to Brussels. My family and I had a connecting flight from Berlin to Stuttgart, Germany. Our original flight got delayed an hour so we had to be moved us to an earlier flight to make our connecting one. Once we got to Brussels we couldn't find our bags, we went to customer service and Eurowings had left a note saying â€œyou're luggage is still in Berlin. Sorry for the troubleâ€. At this point we were very mad because our medicine and toiletries were in our luggage. The next day we had to buy new clothes. They said they would send it to our Airbnb in Paris for when we get there but our train didn't get in until 9 so it was arranged that they would wait til 9:30. As my mom was on the phone with them saying that we weren't gonna be there til 9:30 the guy yelled at her and said â€œYou were supposed to be here at 9. Get here or I'm leaving!â€ After that they got disconnected, and when my mom tried to call back they wouldn't answer her calls. So obviously we ran to the Airbnb to get here at around 9:15-9:20 to see that he had left. They haven't given any info to when they will supposedly bring our luggage to us, but we're furious because we aren't being compensated even though we have to buy new things again tomorrow. Would never recommend Eurowings!",Detractor

I flew from Thunder Bay to Toronto in the most uncomfortable seats imaginable in the back row while the plane was full with Air Canada staff flying in their aisle seats. In Toronto apparently paying for your seat is not enough. I did not have a pre-booked seat so that meant I was a second class citizen due no courtesy or respect from the Air Canada ticket attendant who didn't even want to speak to me until everyone else was on the plane. While I flew in a seat marked ""Crew"" in the back of the plane in the middle seat again the flight was full of Air Canada staff. I have flown my last flight with them.",Detractor
SIN-RUH-FRA. First leg was in a very nice 777 which was one of the most convenient flights I have experienced. Spacious leg room endless entertainment options and nice food. Transit in Riyadh was interesting as we could leave the airport after a strange procedure that took 2 hours but it was worth it as I don't want to stay in any airport over night if I have another option. Second leg to Frankfurt wasn't that nice. The 6 hour long flight was in a small A320 without much entertainment and with worse comfort. It would be ok for a flight half as long as this but for 6 hours after a rough night was really a bit hard. Staff on both flights were alright nothing special though I would definitely fly with them again great value in my opinion.,Promoter
"My husband and I returned to Toronto from Tokyo on Air Canada yesterday. Our trip to Southeast Asia was with Eva Air. We were fortunate enough to fly Business Class (on points) both ways. The similarity ends there. Eva Air was the height of travel luxury - Air Canada definitely was not. From the so-called Welcome Onboard we knew things were different. With the exception of 2 flight attendants on AC the others were diffident at best one of the flight directors downright rude. It seemed that they couldn't wait to get home. Our flight map didn't work. We were told ""too bad'. One of the BC washrooms was out of service from the beginning of the flight. Of course it was helpful to be able to lie flat but the beds were not very comfortable the quilt looked and felt as if it came from Walmart and the travel kit was just okay. The remaining two washrooms were tiny and poorly maintained. As for the food - the lamb dinner was floating in grease the beans were overcooked and the meal was inedible. As for the so-called Business Class service it needs a major overhaul.",Detractor
They are a real hodge podge of excellent and completely inept service. Pros: The inflight entertainment okay legroom inflight attendants and meals were above average. Cons: On the return flight from JNB-JFK I checked in 2.5 hours before the flight and was told I couldn't fly. My confirmed reserved seats were still available but they'd loaded too much cargo. After 2 hours of staff bickering with each other they finally allowed us on the plane but had given my family's seats away to someone else. When they finally issued our seats we were scattered and all 4 of us were in the worst possible non-connected middle seats. No apology for the inconvenience. The inbound flight from IAD-JNB did not have these issues and remitted a higher rating. But it felt like customer service roulette. They did however misplace one of our luggage items and took 4 days to get it to us.,Detractor
 The booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the baggage allowance in terms of the seats one can book. The cost of including a bag added considerably to the cheapest fare. Check-in was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their bags in. Departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well. My gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty. Some of the to buy M&S food items were not available and the lavatory I used was dirty. The staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop-down route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy. Hardworking crew.,Passive
"The trouble started at SIN itself when our onward journey from IST to LIS was cancelled without notification. Upon inquiring at the airport, we were told that the cancellation was a mistake and that the sector would be reinstated. Once the reinstatement happened, we got our boarding passes. Looking at the trouble that we had, I asked the Turkish Airlines staff to reconfirm our return flight from IST to SIN and we were even allotted seats 16 A/B. The leg space in A330 is poor and I have never ever experienced such uncomfortable seats. The seating in Boeing 737 is more normal and I did not have any issues from IST to LIS. On our way back, IST airport was chaotic. People were not maintaining the queues and check-in was the most unruly I have encountered. Once we reached the counter we were informed that the flight is full. I told the agent that it is good for TK and I just want my boarding pass. I got the boarding pass after some reluctance on the agents part. I did not give it much importance but as soon as we moved from the counter, I saw STB on our seat allocation. I went back and inquired and was informed that we have been put on Standby. Even after informing the agent that I have confirmed seats, she said that she is unable to help me and that I would be helped at the gate. At the gate, the agents told us that a supervisor is going to come to help us out. However for the entire boarding time, no one came and only when we started to get agitated did someone come. There were approx 9 passengers who were on standby and the supervisor let 2 of them board. Then they allowed my wife to board and I was told that there is no more spare seat. I was angry and credit to the supervisor, he was professional and sent his assistant to physically check inside the aircraft and they found an empty seat which was allocated to me. Even though I boarded the flight that I was supposed to, I was earmarked for standby as the tag on my delayed luggage proved later. This was unacceptable.",Detractor
" Kinshasa to Brussels via Istanbul. I used to be a fan of Turkish Airlines, flew them several time and rarely had an issue - but that was about 2 years ago! Now, it seems that the company has gone down. I just had the worst flying experience I have ever had (and I travel over 100k miles a year). Flight Aug 31st Kinshasa-Istanbul was delayed 12h, were forced to sleep at the airport because the company kept lying about the time the aircraft was supposed to land instead of getting us into a hotel. When entering the aircraft, they had booked 2, sometimes 3 people on the same seat, which created chaos among a group of already on-edge passengers. During the flight (an almost 8hr flight), all we had to eat was a mini sandwich, no meal. Obviously missed the connection in Istanbul, was re-booked on another flight in a middle seat just to realized at arrival that our luggage were lost in transition. There are 3 flights a day from Istanbul to Brussels, yet it took them 2 days to send our luggage. And cherry on the cake, I've been stuck at home all day waiting for them to deliver my suitcases (were supposed to do it from 1pm to 6pm, then from 6pm to 8pm - it's 8:43pm and still nothing). I had to call them for the third time today just to hear that the guy has not even left the storage facility yet.

Upon asking the stewardess if she could find a seat next to my partner (which we had been assured was sorted on checking in), she just said â€œ flight is fullâ€. They are very mean with the drinks, no miniature bottles, just a bottle on the trolley which was sparingly measured (I got nasty looks when I asked for a â€œ largeâ€ one) unlike Emirates who were very obliging with anything you requested. Toilets and aircraft overall seemed grubby. There were no menus to check what was on offer and what was on offer inedible unless you were starving due to queuing for hours to check in (even after online check in).

Seat is quite narrow, and for anyone with wide shoulders, it is pretty uncomfortable. Food Mediocre at best. End of meal cheese selection not altogether bad. Give this 3 stars - overall I would rate this airline 2 stars at best. Not one area of the airline excels or stands out, except in a negative way. The only good thing was there was a buggy waiting outside the plane to transport passengers to the immigration counter, but it was 1 buggy, so you have to scramble to get on it, but I understand other airlines have a similar facility so it may be a Mumbai airport facility other than Brussels Airline service.

I flew CPT-DOH-FRA on B787/A350 (16 April 2015) and return LHR-DOH-CPT on A380/B787 (30 April 2015). All in all a massive disappointment. B787 is without doubt the most uncomfortable aircraft I have flown on and is to be avoided. Qatar Airways like most others have opted for the high density seating in economy of 3x3x3 instead of 2x4x2 for which the aircraft was designed. This results in horrendously narrow seats with poor pitch and legroom. Worst of all a hard metal entertainment box in the foot well of every window and aisle seats. The box takes at least one third of foot well space and forces ones feet close together if you wish to stretch out your legs. The metal box bites into the side of your shin and is painful and uncomfortable. The new Airbus A350 with a wider body and 3x3x3 is far better. More spacious more width and a less intrusive entrainment box in the foot well. A350 XWB wins hands-down in passenger comfort over it's rival B787. Food was average to abysmal on all sectors served lukewarm to cold. Drinks service okay and champagne and cognac a plus in economy class. On all flights the crew were friendly but surprisingly disorganised during meal service. Running backwards and forwards through the cabin to supply vegetarian meat and chicken dishes not correctly loaded in trolleys. There was a clear lack of effective communication between crew members during service. Cultural issues perhaps as the staff are a multinational mish-mash from all over the world. Better communication and cultural diversity training for staff would help. The awful cramped B787 and shockingly bad food on 2 sectors (lukewarm and mass packaged and prepared). Avoid any sectors that use the B787 Dreamliner it's a nightmare.,Detractor

Thus each time I need to go to washroom both middle seat and isle seat passengers need to get out of their seats too which is really inconvenient to all passengers. Secondly there was no inflight entertainment despite the crew restarting the system several times which is outrageous for a long haul flight.

"DOH-CMB-DOH. Business Class. QR does not live up to its ""The World's Five Star Airline"" slogan on some routes. It could be three to four star service especially as they have varying business class products (seats IFE etc.) in their fleet. Outbound I carefully selected a B777-300ER when booking but they changed that later to an older A321 that did not have lie-flat sleeper seats on this 4.5 hour night flight that was scheduled to leave DOH at 01:05. It left DOH about an hour late due to the incoming aircraft's delay and failed to make-up the lost time when arriving in CMB. Boarding was very poor in DOH and CMB. The seats more like premium economy products in many airlines' fleets were most uncomfortable and the control buttons didn't respond well to make adjustments. No amenity kit was offered and the food served was slightly above average. It was good that there were only six passengers in the 12-seat cabin on that flight so we could spread out a bit. The two inflight staff members were very good and attentive. On the inbound flight the B777-300ER's seating product was in complete contrast to their A321 though still not on par with the latest offerings of some of their competitors and also their own B787/A380 business class products. The service and food were similar to the outbound flight. This flight was on time. The new QR business class lounge in DOH is outstanding and amazing in terms of design and services available. The new DOH airport itself is not as good as places like Changi in Singapore but a huge improvement over the old one.

After standing in said line we were given no information about when we would be on another flight and another hour later were shuttled to a hotel where we still received no info. I had to call the airline myself, from a foreign county to find out how I was going to make it home. After being given the wrong information and seeing that our online itinerary had us going to the wrong final destination I had to call again. We finally made it home about 30 hours later. We were in good spirits as was most of the flight despite our trouble. However after several hours of no organization or communication and being left to fend for ourselves on how to get home we were all pretty livid. I wouldn't normally go out of my way to share a negative experience but this was so grossly mishandled that I thought others should know.

"  Montreal to Toronto. The plane was delayed by around half an hour due to the late arrival of the aircraft. Halfway through the flight, about 40 minutes or so before we were scheduled to land at Billy Bishop Airport in downtown Toronto, the crew announced that the plane needed to be diverted to Pearson Airport, around 1hr away from downtown. Of course everyone was upset, but the reason given for the diversion was that (due to the delayed departure), the downtown airport was closed due to the night curfew. It was around 21.45hrs at the time, so I assumed the curfew was at 22.00hrs. Once we landed at Pearson, a manager came onboard and contradicted what was stated earlier. The plane was diverted because the crew were based at and needed to return to Pearson Airport. There were around 40 passengers aboard, and the time and inconvenience of these passengers were less important than the time of their crew. While I empathise with the plight of the hardworking crew, it says a lot about an airline that would put the needs of its customers second. And the airport curfew at Billy Bishop that the passengers were informed about and initially used as the justification for the diversion? It's 23.00hrs, meaning we had plenty of time to land.

  Chicago to Burbank via San Francisco booked for November 2017. The customer service I have received through this company has been nothing but terrible. While on the phone with them they were very rude and couldn't give me any alternate options or help. They only told me to contact costumer service via email. They didn't provide me with an email address and I couldn't find one on the site so I had to use an outside source to find the email. When I contacted via email it took them two weeks to write back to me and another week to reply to my response just to tell me that they couldn't help me at all. This is highly inappropriate. If you wish to run a business then make sure your agents are trained to solve all problems and trained to actually respond to costumers in a timely manner. I also want to add that the website never works and is beyond difficult to navigate. I am beyond upset with the service I was given and I plan to never fly United again.,Detractor
"  London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways, and this was by far the best travel experience I have had. The limo pick up was excellent, they arranged a convenient time, very polite driver and a great car. The Heathrow Lounge was very well presented with a table service if you wanted to dine, along with roaming staff for drinks or light refreshments. I had a spa treatment which was excellent. Boarding the aircraft was easy and I was welcomed at the door and shown to my apartment. The apartment was out of this world and I was shown all of its features and offered drinks/canapes and a menu. The crew could not do enough for me and this continued for the whole flight. The food was restaurant quality and well presented. Having a shower onboard was an experience, and the toiletries provided were excellent. Would thoroughly recommend Etihad and the flight to Australia was a dream.",Promoter
"  I have not travelled with United Airline for about a year. The policy has changed so much that it almost sounds like United doesn't want to retain cutomers anymore. On this flight from San Francisco to Phoenix, for basic economy passengers, not only they now want $25 for each carry-on they also force everyone to checkin the carry-on. This is a disgrace. First of all, the airline is greedy enough to charge carry-on fee. Secondly, they like to cause an incovenience to their passengers to have to wait for baggage claim after landing when it is carry-on and can be stored in the overhead bins. United Airlines is a prime example of corporations that wrongly put profit before customer experience. In my next time flying, I will surely stay away from United Airlines.",Detractor

"â Unverified | Los Angeles to Paris via Keflavik. Me and my sister booked a trip to Europe in September 2016 for March 7th through the 13th of 2017. I would call once a month to make sure the flight was still on time and nothing had changed. And every month everything was ok and still the same. The reason I would check so often is because I read the reviews and they said that WOW air flights were being cancelled without proper notice. Since they would assure me every time I called , that everything was ok, I proceeded to book my tours and hotel room in December. I booked a hotel stay and 5 tours around paris France. The time approached quickly for our departure and the day before our flight we received a message that our flight had been cancelled. We were suppose to board on the 7th march at 10:03am and WOW air sent us a cancellation message March 6th at 11pm. They gave us 2 choices. We could receive a full refund but it would take 5 to 7 business days or we could get on the next flight that was available and that was for march 11th. I was devastated. That would mean we would miss all the tours and would only have two days in the hotel we paid 6days for. There was no other accommodation on their end. So I had to book through another airline and spend money on two extra tickets in order to get to the room On time. And also make it for the tours. I will never book with WOW air again. They were unprofessional, with minimal customer service and cost me so much extra money with care about the perdicament they put me and my sister in. It was obvious that they did not care about us. I ended up getting my money back at the end of my trip so wow airlines ruined my whole trip it was a catastrophe. I hope that they shut them down. Please read the reviews.

I flew Auckland - LAX on 6 May and return 26 May. First flight was on 777-200 which was looking pretty tired but that's about the only criticism I have. Service food entertainment crew and seats in business premier all to a very high standard. Return leg was on a 777-300 and although similar had a much fresher cabin a bigger touch screen TV and a really good thick mattress which they put over the bed plus two decent sized pillows. As seats they are nothing special with very limited settings but as a bed they are superb - fully flat plenty long enough and much wider across the shoulder which makes a huge difference compared to say Qantas where you feel you are in a slim fit coffin with not enough room to turn over. Crew were friendly and professional on both flights very generous with beverages and food of a very good quality not a huge selection but that's a minor gripe.,Promoter

Horrible experience. I made the mistake of booking United for the short 40 minute trip from Doha to Dubai (United has a daily Washington DC-Doha-Dubai flight). Security at Doha airport for this particular flight was exhausting with United staff fingerprinting passengers taking off shoes etc as if we were going to the US instead of just Dubai.

LHR-HKG-LHR in First. A brief trip to celebrate New Year in Honkers. Pleasant First class check in average Fast Track and warm welcome in the Concorde Room. Escorted to a table for 3.

"My wife and I and baby daughter (1 year old) flew with Turkish Airlines from Dublin to Dammam via Istanbul in September.

Singapore to Amritsar with a transit in Delhi. The domestic flights were much better than the international flights in every aspect. Upon check-in the officials insisted that our luggage had to be checked out in Delhi and checked in again when the final destination for the luggage was clearly stated as Amritsar on the luggage tags. The same happened on our way back. My 83-year-old grandmother was with me and she has difficulty walking so we requested for a wheelchair for her. Due to this we were the last to get off so that my grandmother had more time and could get off slowly. When we landed in Delhi from Singapore for transit there was a delay in bringing in the wheelchair and the female flight attendant who was apparently in a hurry to get off told my grandmother to walk out and wait outside the plane for the wheelchair. Domestic flight attendants showed more care and were very accommodating towards my grandmother. In-flight entertainment was not working to Delhi and there was no in- flight entertainment to Singapore on the old plane which was quite run-down. Our flight to Singapore from Delhi was on 16th Dec 12.05am and we landed in Delhi on 15th Dec after 4pm for transit. When we tried to enter the international airport the security officials refused to let us in asking us to come back 24 hours later as the date written on our boarding pass was 16th Dec. They refused to listen when we explained our flight was 5mins after midnight. We went to the Air India customer service counter where there were other passengers with the same problem. She simply told us to keep our boarding pass and show them our booking confirmation instead which we did and the security did not accept. The customer service officer refused to come out of her counter and speak to the security officials for us. We managed to enter the airport 3 hours later. We also had to request for wheelchair assistance again and the customer service officer told us to wait while she went to get the wheelchair. After making us wait for 40 mins she returned with 2 cups of coffee and no wheelchair. Upon entering the international airport there was a whole new problem with the Air India officials. On reaching Singapore we realised that there was no communication within Air India for the wheelchair assistance. The air stewardess instead told us off that we should have requested for assistance earlier which we did repeatedly. Overall the experience with them was horrible as they created inconvenience for us every step of the way but certainly eye-opening to see that their service could be of this standard.,Detractor
Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers.

"  July 15th, 2016 I flew from Oslo to Manila via Istanbul. We landed normally on time, July 15th, 11pm in Istanbul for a short transfer for the next flight - but that was not to be. Leaving the plane we noticed there was no personnel from Turkish Airlines to be seen. After walking around looking for the gate for the connecting flight we started to feel something was wrong. And it was. The airport was closed (we were the last flight in) and the military coup was in progress. Since there was absolutely no information coming from the airport or Turkish Airlines personnel we had to rely on rumors and twitter to discover what was going on. In short order, here are the events as they unfolded: No personnel from Turkish Airlines was to be seen or heard from in any form from 11pm July 15th until 2pm July 16. They left thousands of transit passengers stranded without food, water or information. No information whatsoever was at any time given to us before the following day 2pm. The transfer desk and information desk was at all times left unmanned. After 14 hours my flight was cancelled. Over the speakers we were given the option to either travel to Turkish Airlines HQ in Istanbul city centre, or call their call center (all lines busy). It was complete chaos.

"My company and I mostly travel on SAS in the Nordic region. Heading up our company in this region I wanted to try out the highly advertised Dreamliner to and from New York. Traveling to NY from CPH was fantastic. I had booked Premium class. Going to NY I enjoyed the great seats and also quite good service. Norwegian had the return flight operated by ""Titan Airways"" a budget carrier from the UK. With an all coach seating arrangement. Norwegian did not inform us despite their website saying that if a different plane is used the customer will get informed prior to the flight. The check in people at JFK said this other plane had also premium seats. So do did the gate crew. All lies. One of my fellow travelers noticed that on his reservation document from 1 week before the trip it already said ""Titan Airways operated"" meaning that Norwegian already knew before the outbound trip that the return flight would not be the Dreamliner. Norwegian however sold us Premium tickets for both Outbound and inbound flight. I have traveled a lot throughout my career but have never seen airline just advertising one product but selling another without telling the customer. Not at the time of buying nor at the time of check-in. Besides the fact that the premium class customers had to travel unexpectedly in a very tight coach seat they now also need to go through the hassle of claiming money back. It is service of the very worst kind. Norwegian doesn't have enough Dreamliners to accommodate all the Dreamliner routes they advertise and sell.",Detractor

We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.,Promoter

LHR-FCO-GIG-FCO-LHR. Really nice surprise at London Heathrow flying on A321 with old Alitalia livery. Service onboard very professional with an excellent hot snack (omelette and salmon) for a duration of 2.5h. Transfer at Rome Fiumicino painless using fast track lane and the airport has lots of shops and restaurants. The Alitalia Giotto lounge was packed but the drinks selection was fine as well as the variety of sandwiches. Boarding A330 to Rio quick using Sky Priority lane. The aircraft had the new Magnifica Class with a 1-2-1 configuration. It was half full. Plenty of space in overhead lockers however if you seat in the middle there are none and have to use the ones on the side. Pre-taking off drinks given great selection of appetizers and the best moment was the food. Alitalia won best Airline Food recently and I was very much looking forward to it. Succulent Beef with Roasted Mediterranean vegetables as main course and for dessert a light unctuous Neapolitan Almond Cake. A 5 stars food and the espresso is served in a very beautiful cup and lid. The IFE had a good variety of recent movies but I thought the international selection was lacking. They have Flat beds (Only Skyteam airline in Europe to have these) and managed a good 7h sleep with a very comfortable duvet. The amenities given were a Bulgari bag with lots of toiletries products very much appreciated and high class. Staff very professional smiling and very happy to go for the extra mile for the customers. Breakfast consisted of a selection of Italian pastries and cakes with fresh fruits excellent! On the return leg Alitalia uses Air France/KLM lounge that can be cramped at times but it has great selection of hot snacks (the palm tree heart quiches are gorgeous). Boarding the A330 was painless again and the Magnifica class was full this time. Despite taking off 1h later we managed to catch up 30 minutes. The amenities given was another Bulgari bag and the best highlight was the food again with Pork Milanese as main course. Slept a good 7hours and had a copious breakfast before landing in Rome. The A321 to London was on time and service very good again. Overall a good value for money their new Magnifica class is an excellent product their Flat beds very comfortable and it's the Best Food I've ever had on an airline. Would recommend to anyone trying their new Business class either for professional purpose or leisure. Will definitely fly again with Alitalia on the lines featuring the new Magnifica Class.,Promoter
