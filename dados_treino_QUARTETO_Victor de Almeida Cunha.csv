" Denver to Orlando. I made a mistake when preparing for my flight. I did not check if hiking poles were allowed on aircraft. They did not fit in either of my two free checked bags. Therefore. I attached them to my personal backpack to carry on the plane. I was stopped at the TSA security checkpoint and was told I was not allowed to bring them. They were expensive and I didn't want to forfeit them to TSA. My two previous checked bags had already been taken away for loading. I had pay $75 to check my personal backpack (being my 3rd checked bag). After purchasing the extra bag, I approached the check in counter. The Southwest employee told me that because the poles were not sealed in the bag (they stuck out of the top) there was a good possibility they would be lost and Southwest airlines would not be responsible for replacing them. I had not choice, but the take a chance. I secured them as best I could. The employee did not give me a luggage ticket, ensuring the airline would not be liable. After a nail biting 3 hour flight, I waited anxiously at baggage claim. Sure enough all three of my bags came through. The poles had separated from my personal backpack, but someone had secured them to my larger suitcase. I am extremely relieved and very grateful to that employee which ensured my belonging would get back to me. Thank you! As for the flight, the friendly staff provided excellent hospitality, offering snacks, drinks, and coffees. The seats allowed plenty of leg room. Our flight arrived 40 mins early!",Promoter
On January 8 2015 I had the displeasure of being a passenger on Air Canada Rouge flight 1828 from Maui to Vancouver and prior to that Air Canada Rouge flight 1827 from Vancouver to Maui. I begin by comparing the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 to the Rouge Boeing 767. You will note from the seating chart that the regular Air Canada Boeing 767 has 39 rows with eight passengers per row. The Rouge aircraft has 49 rows. The additional ten rows undoubtedly speaks volumes to the uncomfortable seating mentioned by many. Like many of the previous commentators I have been a member of the Air Canada Altitude 50K group for years. In good faith I booked with Air Canada to discover my flight to be with Rouge. The Rouge seats are extremely uncomfortable and offer an average sized passenger little if any leg room. Your knees are crushed when the passenger in front moves their seat back. Comparatively the seats are similar to sitting on a wooden church pew for the duration of the flight. I will never again fly Rouge. From Edmonton there are a number of other options available.,Detractor
"  Noumea to Napier via Auckland. Paid an extra $350.00 for movies on the plane and one food option - says drinks provided but only get two, probably a total value of $35.00. Landed in Auckland and Napier flight cancelled due to an engineering problem and have to wait 13 hours for another flight. 2 flights were cancelled at the same time due to weather issues, why would you not use one of these planes to fly to Napier instead? All in all a disappointing experience with the staff acting blunt and rude to the customers I saw in line and myself rather then sorry and genuine.",Detractor
"  San Francisco to Phuket via Guangzhou on 22nd June. The worst airline and customer service I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. On the day of my flight out of SFO, I could not check-in online or see the flight status. My flight to Guangzhou was delayed 4 hours and the airline did not bother to send any flight updates the morning of, even though they knew by 9am that my 2pm flight was going to be delayed. The check-in counter staff were unorganized. My boyfriend asked if we could be upgraded for free to premium economy and they wanted to charge an extra $400 for more leg room. Our 4 hour layover caused us to miss our connecting flight to Phuket in Guangzhou. We were promised by the SFO staff that we would receive a hotel voucher so we could get some rest before our 10pm flight out of China. We arrived in Guangzhou at 2am. No one at Guangzhou airport spoke English and there were only a handful of China Southern employees working that late. After running around the airport for over an hour trying to find customer service to receive our hotel voucher, we were ushered onto a bus at 3am and driven to an undisclosed location to the dirtiest hotel I've ever seen. The bus staff refused to tell us where they were taking us, even though it was a 45 minute drive from the airport. We, along with 5 other Americans in the same situation, demanded the bus driver return us to the airport after he refused to let us know when the next shuttle would return. After returning to the airport, I asked staff if it was possible for me to change my flight so I could fly into another city in Thailand and catch a different flight (on a different airline) to Phuket. Customer service told me no and said I was not allowed to make any changes to my flight. When I asked if I could just not board the plane and cancel my trip with them, I was also told no. After being stranded in Guangzhou for the day, the flight to Phuket was fine. They lost our baggage, but fortunately, the staff at Phuket airport were phenomenal and found our bag the next day. Our return flight from Phuket to Guangzhou to SFO was on time, however, they did lose my bag again. The worst airline I have ever had the misfortune of interacting with.",Detractor
"I checked our family of 6 in online before we departed YVR. For some reason, I was not able to complete this for my sister. Once we arrived at YVR, the agent could not explain why there was a problem. Departure was on time. Leg room was non-existent, and I'm only 5'2"" tall! Seats cushion reminded me of those foamies we used to sit on in 1978 for a football game. Seat only reclined 1.5"" for an red-eye flight. Only purchased a chocolate bar for $3.50 so no idea of food quality. Only 2 drink services on a 6 hour flight seemed a little poor (and hot drinks were not available one way). IFE was non-accessible because we weren't told about the app until 3 minutes before we had to turn off our phones - no time to download. On the way home I has this handled only to discover the movies were tremendously old! Attendant who spoke in eng/fr over the PA system spoke so poorly, it reminded me of a Charlie Brown episode. I'm all for low-brow discount air travel, but I expected better of AC. I might as well have flown with Allegiant. In that case, I know what I'll find (and do to Vegas regularly). So poor value for $. For the same amount, I could fly with Hawaiian out of Seatac and receive full service and leg room.",Detractor
LHR-BKK return. Although EVA AIR Premium do give you lots more legroom the rest of the flights were poor. This airline does not appear to want to give you any alcoholic drinks. All they do is offer you water and juice. The cabin crew are ok but nothing special. The food was awful and worse still plastic cutlery kid size. On flight BKK-LHR (a day flight) the afternoon meal was a breakfast. Flight crew welcomed us onboard when on the final approach on both flights. You do get a better seat but that is all.,Detractor
"  Denver to Philadelphia. A 6 hour delay was the absolute worst experience of my entire life I have never been so uncomfortable, and tired in my whole life. Every step of the process was delayed. We left late. Had to stop at a different airport for gas. And now we're sitting here waiting for a ground crew.",Detractor
" Lisbon to Brussels. I read a few days before my scheduled flight that a strike was announced at Brussels Airlines. I immediately called the call center and they suggested a flight to me at 12:25 am. When I asked which company, the employee answered me 'SN Brussels Airlines'. They are on strike that day? Yes, indeed, but it is 4 days later. Completely worthless and apparently the employee could not find a better option. A little later I received an email that my flight was indeed going to be canceled. In the meantime I had booked a flight with Ryanair myself: they still had tickets available on the day of the flight, but the Brussels Airlines employee could not or could not book them. A few days later I received an e-mail from the booking of Brussels Airlines to a Lufthansa flight 24 hours after my planned date: I could not do anything with that either. Once we were home, we filed a claim by registered mail: except for an acknowledgment of receipt, I was not allowed to hear from them, despite several reminders. The service they offer is now a copy of Ryanair: rudimentary and once it goes wrong you are alone: a worthless service center and non-existent after service. Take your business elsewhere, that's what I will do in the future.",Detractor
"  Budapest to Florence via Zurich with Swiss / Helvetic. Short haul flights with good seats, food etc. Standout was the personal service. My 86 year old mother had a Swiss provided personal assistant all the way from arrival to departure at Zurich, which involved bus transfers, steps, escalators, carry on luggage, checking her right to her seat(s). Also provided assistance on arrival at Florence. It was the day the main road collapsed in Florence so everything was in chaos, but Swiss just got on and did what was needed.",Promoter
Flew TPE-CGK on Garuda was supposed to fly on July 13th instead was moved to July 14th due to typhoon. The food was good the inflight entertainment was good though there's still room from improvement. The food was good had some grilled fish for breakfast. Seat was better than SQ's. I'm stunned with the improvement and will definitely fly with Garuda again but on Executive Class maybe.,Promoter
" Iberia is the worse airline if it comes to customer service. They claim to be the most punctual airline in the world, but if they are late and you miss your connecting flight because this one departs on time you are in trouble. No service at all. They even close the gate 5 minutes before you arrive and they know you are on the grounds and trying to get the connection, but because they are so punctual, no chance. If you in business you most likely experience next thing is a downgrade into Economy with no word of sorry or no attempt to try and work alternatives out. Compensation, forget it. Service in Economy with a paid Business ticket means on Iberia you have to pay eventually for drinks and food. Economy is Economy and nothing better than Ryanair. On top of all of this, and you paid for Business in the first place, they cut your Milage down to Economy too. Can it get worse? Wonder if they would deny you the Lounge access too, as you are now officially downgraded to Economy. Never again, or I pay Low Cost in the first place. Saves me anger and my budget at the end.",Detractor
" EVA Air is the cheapest premium economy for this journey from London to Bangkok and it seems that myself and a lot of other people booked it thinking that we were getting a bargain on a top 5 airline. What a surprise we had. The seats are good, the boarding was organized, and those were the best points. The food was amazingly rubbish. The main meal was three small pieces of chicken thigh, with a small potion of rice and veg, the breakfast was an omelette with half a sausage! Would it have been a big deal to give us a full sausage each! I have had much better meals on both Thai and Singapore economy, flying the same route. So for the extra Â£400 on top of the economy fare, I got a small bag with eye mask, toothbrush and paste etc, a slightly wider seat, a crowded cabin and boring meals. And the economy section was less crowded. If economy is less crowded on my return trip, I'll ask to be downgraded from premium to standard economy. I fail to understand why this airline is rated so highly, I found Thai and Singapore to be of much better quality.",Detractor
LHR to YUL on Boeing 777. Following a somewhat chaotic boarding process driven by the awkward queuing arrangement at the new Terminal #2 boarded the plane only to sit on board for nearly 50 minutes awaiting ATC clearance for takeoff. Once in the air the service was prompt with very attentive FA's. Meal and drink selections were good but the main course I chose lacked flavour. Good inflight AVOD with decent selection of movies and entertainment. Pre-arrival snack was mediocre at best. Despite a late departure the crew was able to make up most of the lost time achieving an almost on schedule arrival. Overall it was a pleasant experience but I must say the new staggered seat configuration in business class is a significant downgrade from the pods. Seat controls are in the arm rest resulting in frequent accidental activation. In lie-flat position one's feet have to fit into a very small space which is very uncomfortable. Swiss utilizes the same seats but provides more leg/foot room. The table is difficult to operate and even the FA's struggle with it. I have been a top-tier loyal customer of AC but if they choose to convert all of their long-haul business class to this seating configuration I will look for alternatives in a hurry.,Passive
Buenos Aires - Eze to Madrid. Bad experience on my last flight with Iberia. Very old A340 300 aircraft. No PTV. Seats uncomfortable. Blanket and pillow dirty without the usual plastic wrap.

"  First time flying with British Airways in economy on a Transatlantic flight from London to Chicago. I was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly Flight Attendants. They walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals, snacks and drinks of all kinds. I will definitely fly British overseas again given a chance. The economy seats on this old but well kept Boeing 747-400 were very comfortable and I am a 5'9"" x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped. I would encourage all my friends to fly British if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the US to Europe. Thank You British Airways, very good service indeed.",Promoter
Orlando-Quito-Orlando via Panama on an award ticket using my OnePass miles. I make frequent trips to South America and after flying US carriers many times I was shocked by how different the experience was. All flights left on time aircraft were quite new and well-maintained onboard service was warm and professional (they actually thank you with a smile when picking up garbage and service items and treat you as if they value your business) they permit non-elite customers to book exit row seats the food was edible liquor was available free of charge and the transfer in Panama was absolutely painless and stress-free. Given the efficiency of the ground crew in Panama and the airline in general short connection times in Panama should not be a problem. I also had an issue with my reservation that needed to be worked out prior to my departure and instead of being placed on hold for an unreasonable amount of time or waiting in line for an hour at the airport check-in counter only to be greeted by someone who treats you like the enemy a Copa representative assisted me through their 24-hour live chat service after only having to wait 30 seconds and spared me a lot of time and headache.,Promoter
"Our return leg back to Abuja from Heathrow was terrible. Me and my wife were issued just the boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow, while my son (2.5 years old) got boarding pass to Istanbul from Heathrow and Istanbul to Abuja. When I complained they said don't worry, jut pick it up when you get to Istanbul. We arrived Istanbul and someone from Turkish Airlines was announcing to us that passengers transiting to Abuja should go to the boarding gate immediately - we complained that we were not given boarding pass in Heathrow and the guy said go upstairs. We got upstairs at the Turkish Airlines desk told them we need boarding pass. After waiting for about 2 mins, I noticed the lady had a strange look on her face, unfortunately they don't speak good English, so off she went came back after about 2 minutes with someone who flatly told us, sorry you cannot board that plane. I asked him why, he said the plane has departed. He said the option we have is to either spend 48 hours in a Hotel in Istanbul, they'll take care of our hotel bills and food or we go via Egyptair that has a 6 hours wait in Istanbul, 8 hours wait in Cairo and a total of about 8 hours flight. We spent 6 hours wait time on a cold metal chair in Istanbul and 8 hours in Cairo. After a combined 8 hours flight from Istanbul to Abuja via Cairo, we finally arrived Abuja. We got to Abuja but all my checked in luggage could not be found. 5 days after arriving Abuja Turkish airline is telling me its the responsibility of Egyptair to find my luggage not theirs.

  Toronto to Yerevan via Warsaw. Regret choosing this airline. Flight from Warsaw to Yerevan was delayed for 1 hour 45 minutes 2 hours before boarding. Then my flight was cancelled without explanation from Warsaw to Toronto. No compensation was provided. Called to LOT in Warsaw and was waiting for 60 minutes and nobody picked up the phone. After that decided to write an email 4 days passed still no response from them. Price for the ticket was not cheap. I flew before via Ukrainian Airlines and can say that they are way better than LOT.

Sydney - Christchurch - Sydney. The flight over was acceptable with service pretty poor only one choice left out of two for the meal only one side of the sound in my headphones for IFE worked. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Flight back was poor. Flight was an hour late departing although they made up a lot of that time. Staff are quite rude tending to order you around and not showing much interest in customer comfort. My seat had a great big lump in the back like a spring had come loose or something. It was very uncomfortable. I told the FA who wasn't very interested but said she'd see if anything else was available after we took off. I told her I'd like to sit with my wife and she said 'its only a couple of hours so put up with it. It was so uncomfortable I'm not sure what I would have done if it had been a longer haul. food was OK had a choice this time IFE OK.,Passive
Flew from Heathrow to San Francisco on May 1st with BA. What a disappointment! I had to pay over Â£120 to sit next to my husband having already paid for the flight. Then we couldn't access the entertainment for over 90 minutes at the start of the flight due to some technical problem and again later in the flight it went off for about 60 minutes presumably due to the same problem. Our first meal was served more or less straight away and it was OK typical airline fare but there was then over 7 hour wait for the next meal which was laughably called afternoon tea one piece of bread cut into quarters with chicken and a scone with cream and butter. Four hours after the main meal they ran out of snacks and when my husband went in search of something to eat they gave him two packs of nuts and said they were for the return journey! Don't they stock up before picking up the next passengers? Luckily my husband always carries chocolate bars with him as he is diabetic but heaven knows what might have happened had he needed food from the staff. Before half way two of the toilets went out of service so there were some queues. Would I fly BA again certainly not long haul although unfortunately I have to return to Heathrow with them from Boston today.,Detractor

I rarely take this airline and on September 12 2013 from LGA to YOW I know why I avoid this carrier whenever possibly. Stupid decisions in difficult (weather) situations are not usually typical of A 4 star airline. I travel weekly in North America and I would rate several domestic carriers far superior. Over priced costly flexibility and staff that at times act condescending does not equate to a top rated airline.,Detractor
Flew MAN-ZRH-DEL with wife and 2 kids on 9th August 2014. The MAN-ZRH leg operated by Helvetic Airways on behalf of Swiss. Good service and good snack served during flight. The kids were taken good care of. ZRH Airport is a nightmare to connect flights. Had an hour to catch a connecting flight so were literally running for the next flight. No proper signage as well as no officials to ask directions we ended up on the arrivals level looking for the gate to top it all the security made us scan the baggage again before going to departures opening the duty free purchases again and scanning the liquor bottles. Anyway once at the gate and boarding the onward flight things were back to normal. Good service food entertainment. Would definitely recommend the airline but not Zurich airport.

" I booked my BA flight from Zurich to London Heathrow using Avios, my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process. When I tried to reserve an aisle seat (for medical reasons) the BA website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which I would have had to pay about thirty pounds. The check-in area for BA at Zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport. The check-in agent was very professional, helpful and informative. The area of departure from Zurich was by transfer train. The flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time. I was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk German speaking sports fans. One of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead. In the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service. The overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight none of which were in German. The flight arrived reasonably promptly.",Passive

" London to Sydney via Jakarta. While the quality of the service in the air is good, on the ground it is bad. They outsource their ground staff at Heathrow to DNata, who couldn't care less. My wife was one kilo over in business class and the woman behind the counter was incredibly rude. They advertise business promo fares on their website as being refundable and changeable. If you attempt to change a flight, however, they advised me that the ticket is not changeable. No local office where you bought the ticket will help you, they will refer you to the Indonesian headquarters, which are full of staff reading off scripts and there is no escalation process to speak to anyone who can help. Our schedule changed four times from booking to takeoff, and their staff accidentally cancelled my frequent flyer account and refused to add back miles from my flights. The lounge in Jakarta has very little air conditioning so you sweat the whole time you're in transit, the food is bad, there was no alcohol and the seating is uncomfortable.

The difference in service is that I can change my flights whenever I want for a smaller fee. So ended up paying 200EUR to arrive 2 hours late.

Beauvais (Paris) to Bratislava 8 September: the absence of any seat booking as a standard service makes boarding Ryanair feel like a cattle yard experience (we paid the extra for a seat reservation and that worked well). The total inflexibility on luggage weight is a sham and price gouge policy. We are both smallish people our carry on luggage was well under weight and one checked in bag (which of course we paid for) was 1 kg over bang another 20E ie it is per bag if hers was under and mine over you still pay on the one that is over. The flight crew were fine but the check in woman forgot to stamp my wife's boarding document so having gone through the queue we had to run back for that.

" Denpasar to Paris via Doha. Overall a very good experience. First flight from Bali to Doha on the 777 was with their old business class offering. Seats are big and comfortable, however are angled flat beds and not completely flat. Travelling with my partner and a toddler the seat was wide enough for my son to sleep beside me which was a huge bonus. Food on this flight was excellent along with an excellent cabin service from the staff on board. I did not use the entertainment system and slept for most of the 10 hour flight so cannot comment on this. The second leg from Doha to Paris was again on a 777 but this time we had the QSuite. Having flown on many different carriers business offering this is by far the best I have seen. We took the 2 centre seats which when converted to flat created a double bed. Having this when travelling with a young child was a huge help. The suites offer maximum privacy and create a sense that you are flying alone. Seats are very comfortable, IFE excellent with large HD screen and lots of viewing options. Food again was very good with lots of options to choose from. Once again the staff were some of the best I have experienced in the sky and nothing was too much trouble for them.

Clean modern aircraft excellent choice of entertainment bigger than normal seats in economy but I wonder why there are poor reviews about lack of food as this is clearly noted on the online booking system which a fellow passenger had obviously NOT noticed and ended up causing an unnecessary delay in everybody else getting their pre-ordered food which was very good again.

Food only consisted of a small bag of snacks/pretzels and drinks, served by bored-looking and not too friendly FAs. I havent heard ""please"" or ""you're welcome"" once. Transfer in Vienna was ok, Austrian Terminal is new but not interesting, just a long grey corridor with gates and few shops - boring. Very nice lounge in VIE, good food and beverage selection. In Sofia my suitcase arrived as a last one, despite being tagged as a Priority. Shame. Both flights just correct, nothing to remember.",Detractor

"Excellent flight with Ethiopian Airlines. It's so nice to have a direct flight from Los Angeles to Dublin. I was so surprised to only see a few Irish people on board making use of this excellent connection. I hope Ireland utilizes this more so they keep the route open. My return ticket was only $750 and it leaves Los Angeles at around midnight and lands around 6pm so it really helps with jet lag so you don't need to wait around all day like a zombie before going to sleep. The cabin crew were really nice, helpful and happy to be there. The airplane is the new boeing dreamliner. It's so quiet, the air is not as dry and the entertainment system was great.

Economy: LHR-BKK return. Very hard to give a balanced review as each flight in the four parts was like flying different airlines. The service levels varied so much. Food very good on all legs. Transfer in Bahrain 10/10 great little airport and no buses. Flight attendants: from the gum chewing lady who loudly told her co-worker she didn't like speaking German to the girls that though it funny that they where too busy to get into position and could only point to one exit door during the safety video. Contrast this to the crew on the last leg home who without doubt could have been from any of the top performing airlines in the world. Would I fly Gulf again? At their low prices hard not to Just don't expect to much and then if your lucky your expectations might just be exceeded if your lucky!

" Udon Thani to Bangkok. The engine was broken before take off at 4 pm. If passengers had insisted to fly, they must have waited until 11 pm. The airline didn't suggest us to change to the next flight because of limited available seats. Fortunately, I ran to the booking office and changed to the next flight immediately. Many passengers decided to refund money and bought a new ticket from other airlines. Sadly, many passengers who didn't know these solutions have to wait until 11 pm. Some passengers who changed flights couldn't find their baggage because the airline told them there weren't staffs. I have to check in again. Very long line and very slow because they cannot solve any passengers problems from this flight. I told call center but she told me that she cannot help because it is the ground staff duty. After I checked in, My seat number is 58A. When I was on board, there aren't 58th row. Six passengers including me have no seats. Air hostesses always smile when they show how to use inflight equipment only not during providing service onboard. And check in staff never smile as well.",Detractor
A330 Business MEL-HKG. Once onboard I found Cathay Pacific business class absolutely faultless. The seat was comfortable and well designed the crew were attentive friendly and professional the catering was delicious and the entertainment was of good quality and fairly good choice. I can completely see why this product receives such rave reviews from most passengers. My only real complaint is the ridiculously limited baggage allowance. 30kg total is barely acceptable on economy class but for business is it a disgrace. When you compare it to 32kg x3 for other carriers it is not very competitive. Overall though this is an excellent product and well worth the premium.,Promoter

Catering was better from Dubai-Melbourne, some of the meal selections did not translate to tasty meals on the first leg. Staff on both legs were exceptional, very friendly, courteous and nothing was too much of a problem for them. The lounge facilities in Dublin could be improved, however the lounge in Dubai was wonderful. The chauffer service was a nice touch and took the hassle out of getting home from Melbourne Airport. The only other criticism beyond the food (which is a small one) is that the flight display didn't work on the Dubai - Melbourne leg. Would highly recommend business class with this airline.",Promoter

They changed my boarding pass to another flight. My transit time became 11 hours from 1.5 hours because of this. Didn't give me lounge at first. There was no food arranged by them. No internet. They owe a responsibility to arrange lounge, food, hotel if they are the one changing anyone's flight. Ground staff wasn't listening to anyone. Now after boarding to this changed flight, I got to know that my meal preference were not mentioned in crew members chart. And because of their unexpected change I missed my following flight. They didn't compensate even for that. At New York airport when I tried to explain it to their staff, he gave me one email address to file complaint. Guess what, that email address was not for complaints. It was for baggage claim. Now I had to call their office many times to get right email address. Meanwhile I was directed from one place to other. When you call their phone number, in normal business hours their automated system says "" you are calling outside business hours please call again later."" They do not understand English properly.

BKK-DXB-HAM. BKK-DXB Morning Flight EK375 - long check-in queue but check-in staff at Bangkok were friendly. Delayed 30 mins due to waiting for all passengers to finish boarding. A380 full but still roomy in Y (great aircraft) no highlight - same experience as inbound flight in May - very slow service. As the lunch tray arrived to my row it was cold - quality and quantity under 4 stars airline standard. DXB-HAM on EK 61 (B777-300ER) flight full/ no more to say about the feeling of 3-4-3 seating. On this flight the crew was very rude inexperienced and the poorest inflight-service I have received on EK - very chaotic no system. Crews forgot which seat rows they have already served drinks to and which rows they had not. After meals passengers sitting in seats A to E were served drinks tea or coffee twice while the left hand side passengers (F to K) did not get any. Hours later crews noted this mistake during the collecting of meal trays as the coffee cups were unused and it was too late to serve as we were on landing process and no apology came.,Detractor
Flew LHR to LHE via JED. The flight from LHR to JED was fairly good quality which was an A330-300. Seats were good and quite clean. Stopover was for half a day. I would now choose not to fly to JED only if leaving there. Staff don't try to speak even basic English despite it being an important international airport and no communication facilities (telephone) if there are delays. Flight from JED to LHE was unbelievable. They gave us a very old plane (Boeing 747) and most hostesses don't seem too friendly compared to the other flights. TV's will never work on these flights and quality of plane compared to one going to the west doesn't seem right - the quality should be the same. Better to fly to Riyadh for a stop over as some attempt to speak English. Always try to ensure the stopover is kept short.,Detractor
"  Cairo to Doha on a 777-300. Flew with my daughter so had two seats at the windows. Very spacious and comfortable. Nice set-up if traveling with someone. Outstanding service by the flight crew and food as usual. Used the Le Meridien airport hotel for an overnight stay at each end and very satisfied with it. The only major issue with Cairo airport is the lack of transport between terminals - always an adventure. Went through about half a dozen security check points throughout the airport - most I've ever experienced. Everyone at the airport willing to help and friendly. Departed Cairo a bit late even though the airport was pretty ""dead"". Return trip was on an A330-300. Not a good experience compared to the other Qatar Airways aircraft I've flown on (A320, A321, A350, 787, 380). Very cramped and no storage space. Will not use their A330 service again. Once again the flight crew and meals were great but not the aircraft. Qatar continues to excel in all areas and it's always a pleasure flying with them.",Promoter

Flew from Shanghai to Shenzhen on Friday evening. Boarding was efficient and the doors closed on time but that's when the trouble started. We sat on the tarmac for at least 30 minutes and were then told that we were waiting for traffic control clearance. Other announcements were made but they were so quiet that I could not hear what was said. After 1 hour the food came out while we were still waiting on the ground.

"Our return flight from Paris started off on the wrong foot when I tried to check-in online the day before our flight. Although I prepaid for preferred seats at $200 ($100 each), when I tried to check-in we were no longer assigned to these seats, rather we were assigned seats in row 57. When I tried to select preferred seats online it prompted me to pay again. I contacted Air Canada via Twitter and they explained the change was due to an aircraft change, which was wrong as it was a B777ER high density aircraft, which is the type always used on this route. They ended up assigning us to preferred seats 18H/J (rather than 18J/K that I booked), but it was poor customer service that I had to contact them after paying for confirmed seats, and for not being notified of the change in advance. In speaking with the gentlemen in seat 18k, he indicated he was upgraded to the preferred seat for having Super Elite status with AC. Paying passengers should not be bumped for Super Elite passengers. He was a nice man and ended up moving to the middle row which was completely empty, which leads me to wonder why they bumped us out of our seats for him, when there were many other preferred seats available - bad customer service Air Canada. The legroom in row 18 is exceptional, better than Premium Economy actually, which comes in handy considering the lack of width in the 17 inch seats. I usually fly AC, but this has left a bad taste in my mouth. FAs on the return flight were rude and we felt like we were inconveniencing them. During meal service the FA asked if I wanted fish or pasta, and when I asked what the pasta was, she rolled her eyes. The meal was actually delicious (salmon) and we also received a mid-flight snack and small pre-arrival meal consisting of a delicious hot cajun chicken wrap. Beverage service was quite regular.

The worst flight experience my husband and I have had! It cost more for our 2 carry-ons than the cost of our tickets. The flight attendant who checked the boarding passes was terribly rude and unprofessional the service on the plane was outrages. Nothing is free even the water. Narrow seats dehydration one restroom out of order. We flew from O'Hare to San Diego on March 28 2014. At the gate I went first pulling my carry on at the plane entrance I noticed my husband was not behind me. I went back to check and saw my husband being charged for his carry on. At that time the attendant started yelling 'They have two they have two' so the attendant charged my husband another $100 for my carry on! There was no explanation no kindness. It wasn't my fault that the flight attendant let me go at first and then when I came back she treated me like prey she has missed! I will never ever fly with Spirit again.,Detractor
LHR-SFO - Club World. I find myself nodding to the negative yet factual feedbacks of others regarding BA's premium products. Online check in and boarding were smooth and uneventful. That is it! Whoever designed the club world seat needs to have their head examined. The board that signed off on the product should be fired! The seat was narrowed with no space to put your drinks without lowering the dining table. That is just plain stupid. Having to step over another pax to get out of your seat (if seated in window) is another stupid concept! The design offers absolutely no privacy if seated in the aisle. The food was okay nothing to brag about and definitely not at the level expected to see in premium class (compared to the likes of Air France or Lufthansa). Entertainment selection were poor but better than KLM and the screen not of good size. Fly crews were ok. I ordered the beef and the pax next to me did the same. Even though my order was first my neighbour got the last order. Fair enough ended up with Turkey roulade was ok. The crews were apologetic but not attentive. Having flew other carriers I can honestly say theirs little enthusiasm shown by the crew which is a shame. Had an opportunity to look at the 1st class menu. To be frank any carrier who does not offer caviar's in its first class cabin in my view is out with the time. Making this observation because in 2 months I will be travelling to Mexico and the price comparison between Lufthansa and BA are not far apart (former slightly less) but I suspect flying Lufthansa is likely to be more enjoyable than BA based on the experienced of this journey. Will see if the return flight might tilt the view to the (+). I would not pay the published C or F class fares on BA. The product line does not equate to the price. BA was the Waitrose and is now between Tesco or ASDA.,Passive

"British Airways from London Heathrow to Mumbai from Terminal 5 in coach class. Check in uneventful. No boarding priority for people travelling with children, a first for me for any long haul flight. Five minutes before departure, captain announces that someone has checked in a bag but has not turned up so they need to take off the offending suitcase. Fair enough. The staff had botched up loading the suitcase by marking it to be in a container in which it wasn't. Result they started taking off all the containers one by one and searching for the flight. Captain told that he cannot give any estimate. 90 minutes passed after that no announcement, a tired and jaded cabin crew literally disappeared. After 90 mins they realised that people might be hungry and started serving juice. Finally after 1 hr 45 mins captain said that they had found the rogue suitcase and we will be off in 15 mins. The plane suddenly started a push back without any warning. The aircraft was a jaded B747-400, poor seats, poor entertainment equipment which had to be rebooted thrice before it worked. Once airborne the crew said that people were hungry so there will not be a drink service they will be serving lunch - possibly an excuse to do less work. Lunch was ok. Second flight service was a snack before landing for which they lost the child meal I had requested, and shamefully tried to create one by adding a fruit shot to an adult meal.

Neither did they go around asking selfish passengers to close their window blind when most were trying to sleep with daylight outside. On a 14 hr flight this is detrimental to all the other passengers wellbeing as it made it hard to sleep. There is basically no storage in the capsule in front of one, or to the side. The limited storage is behind and to the side, right where all the cables for headphones and chargers sit. Their business class cabin looks cheap. It is serviced like a cheap budget airline.

When I complained I was told that there is nothing that could be done other than refund my ticket and cancel the tripâ€œif I was not happyâ€. As I had meetings planed this was not an option and one which I personally think they use to most BC travellers who are not happy. When I got to Calgary I spoke to the AC representative at customer service and she advised me to write to AC and complain. She told me that this is a budget carrier so don't set your expectations high. As a traveler who clocked up more than 150k miles last year with AC they have certainly made me consider my carrier of choice. The seats were awful the food the same bland offering as usual cabin dated but the staff were attentive and seemed to go out of their way to serve maybe I drew a good hand on this flight.

Flew on QF1/QF2 flight from London to Sydney return in October 2014 on the A380 Business Class. The overall experience was average. Pros - complimentary chauffeur pick up/drop off in London/Sydney flight timings (late departure from London early arrival Sydney and vice versa) good IFE with many options pyjamas provided albeit of a sub-standard quality friendly staff albeit service offering strange. Cons - not all seats have direct aisle access the food/beverage service/options are absolutely sub-standard. Offered first drink within 30 minutes after take off and then a top up/glass of wine with dinner. That's it. For a 14 hour flight that is pretty shocking. You can stand up and go ask for another drink but I hate having to do that as it feels like asking someone to do me a favour. The entire Business class cabin shares 4 lavatories of which the rear ones are shared with Premium-Eco. The staff are friendly but are limited to the designed service offering.

The length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the back of the plane meant most people weren't offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing. The flight attendants were very apologetic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embarrassed to be working for BA. Return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline. They are no better than the budget airlines but with anything other than budget prices.",Detractor

As I reach the counter for the check in I was told by the the clerk that my flight has been overbooked and I had to rebook with an other airline or for a different day. The result was to beg several assistants of the family company of Lufthansa to overbook my flight to Thessaloniki for about 3 hours until they finally found a way to overbook my flight as well as for other 10 people in the same flight. As overbooking is a usual tactic for Eurowings, they definitely should mention that in their website .My experience was really horrible and I would never book with this airline again, although my flight was rebooked without any cost in the end.",Detractor

For lunch they offer a choice of 4 main courses plus a 'daily special selection'. All food is served on one large tray separate serving of appetizers etc. would probably be too time consuming. Quantity and quality fully acceptable so is the presentation and the cabin crews general service standard. In beverages Air China highlights a choice of 7 different teas 4 coffees.

Customers were left stranded and after waiting 36 minutes to speak with a customer service representative on the phone (bc no one was in person) they told me I would need to submit a claim on their website, but they were not sure the airline would refund any sort of credit for the inconvenience.

"  Berlin to Vilnius. After years of reading bad reviews and articles about Ryanair I was very hesitant to fly with them. However, I decided to try them when I found a very low price to my destination, and also because a friend told me they'd improved their customer services considerably. The on-line booking and purchase were simple and straight forward. I received several follow-up e-mails reminding of any additional services I might like to add. Check-in at Berlin Schoenefeld was fast and there was no line. Boarding on-time. Although my carry-on day pack was probably a bit larger and heavier than the rules permit, no one looked at my hand luggage or hassled me about it. I had paid for priority boarding, which worked well. There was separate priority line and we were allowed to board first. The plane was clean, the seat reasonably comfortable, and the service was friendly and efficient. I noticed none of the excessive announcements or heavy selling that I'd read about. Take off and landings were on time. The return flight from Vilnius was equally good and without problem. I was pleasantly surprised by Ryanair and would certainly fly them again. They seem to have turned over a new leaf.",Promoter
Cheap ticket at only Â£229 including luggage one way so was not expecting much. Eurowings flight was on time and arrived early into Bangkok. Boarding was not made clear as only announcement in German and the flight had multiple nationalities on board from Europe and the UK. Aircraft was clean and crew were polite and attentive. For the price of the ticket this was as a bargain and met all my expectations. However in view of the cheap seat which means higher load factors the seat pitch is very tight and your backside will know you have done an 11 hour flight. Also as expected you will need to pay for any films which are on offer through the IFE.,Passive
"Calgary to Santa Clara, Cuba return. Poor service all around! We booked our vacation through Sunwing Airlines based on flights and cost. We were supposed to fly out of Calgary at 7:05am on December 30. We got an email the night before at 10:00 telling us there was a delay in our flight and was rescheduled for 12:35pm. When we called we couldn't get a straight answer as to why the flight was delayed. We were told by one person it was weather, another it was mechanical and finally security issues. We then woke up the day of travel on to find another email saying the flight was yet again delayed another hour. We were lucky as some of the passengers didnt even know about the delay and showed up for our flight at 4:30 am. When we go to the ticket counter to check in more excuses as to the delay. Finally one of the other passengers complained and after reading their contract demanded that they follow through with their policy and every passenger was entitled to a $75 voucher. We finally departed at the time we were supposed to be arriving. The plane was old there was barely any leg room and I'm 5'1"". Once aboard there was a issue with my seat in which they issued to myself and someone else. Seeing we paid extra to choose our seats they moved the other passenger to the back of the plane.

London to Dhaka via Istanbul twice in the last month. Usually I have a good experience with Turkish. However this time it was not so great. The London to Istanbul segments were mostly OK with the exception of the last return flight which was one of the most unpleasant flights I have had in a long time. It started with the children from hell in the row behind. The aircraft was an older A321 which had very poor leg room no IFE to speak of and it was too hot. One lady was quite ill because of the heat. The cabin crew refused to do anything despite complaints. I think everyone just wanted to get off so we were not pleased at having to fly around London on hold for half an hour. The Istanbul/Dhaka part is not operated by Turkish but by Meridiana an Italian charter operation. The A330 aircraft are old and do not come close to the normal Turkish standard. The IFE was very limited - no video on demand seats were old and business seats were basic and not worthy of the price. All airlines seem to put their worst and oldest aircraft on the routes into this part of Asia. I have flown with Emirates and Qatar Airways and both do the same. It is unfair as you do not pay any less for the ticket. On the positive side the overcrowding of the business lounge in Istanbul has improved. I did not have to sit on the floor on any of the 3 times I used it.,Detractor

I am due to fly with my children again in July this year on the A340-200 aircraft (no personal TVs) and I will be very upset if the same thing happens. Surely it must be illegal to show an age restricted movie to under-age minors that cannot stopped from seeing the screen when it is right in front of them? Especially when it is gun violence! I would like to support SAA but I feel strongly that there must be a policy on age restricted movies particularly for the early show.,Detractor

After returning from Lanzarote yesterday with my family (3 generations) I was concerned about flying with Ryanair after all the bad press. However the flight time was good and the price was even better. I did pre-book seats as we were travelling with grandparents. The flight was ok. The crew were polite and helpful but despite offering an extensive 'cafe' service the only food available was a hot panini. As others have mentioned families were split as the flight was full then these people expected others to move so they could be together. I was not asked but others were annoyed. The flight was delayed and I lost count of the times the cabin crew and pilot stressed it was because of earlier problems at Manchester Airport not their fault. Minor niggles but t made for an uncomfortable atmosphere. All in all the crew were polite the flight was good (only an hour delayed) and the seats were fairly spacious.,Passive
"My wife and I recently traveled Melbourne-Hong Kong return with Cathay Pacific. Having previously taken this trip a number of times as economy class passengers we decided to pay the extra and try premium economy (PE), not a good decision. Our problems started when checking in at Melbourne airport. Although booked as Mr and Mrs, we were advised that we were not sitting together. After some discussion crew resolved this at the gate lounge. However, on the return flight we were told once again that we would not be seated together, actually behind each other in the center of the middle three seats. Notwithstanding our objections we were dismissed by ground staff and advised that there was nothing they could do about our situation. On previous flights with other airlines, domestic and international, we have always managed to be seated together when booked as a couple. The dinner meal choices were very limited. There was actually only one choice, as the other listed meal had apparently run out prior to the food cart arriving in the PE section. In addition to this the tray tables in my row could not be deployed without considerable effort and the assistance of other passengers and crew. When combined with the issue of sharing economy toilets at the rear of the aircraft it occurs to me that there is really nothing to suggest that Cathay Premium Economy class is anything more than a more expensive â€˜economy' ticket with a somewhat larger seat. Lots of â€˜economy' and not a lot of â€˜premium'. While performance on the day depends entirely on the crew encountered, in my opinion the overall performance of the airline has deteriorated since we first traveled with them five years ago. Based on our recent experience I would not recommend Cathay Pacific â€˜Premium Economy' it does not represent value for money.",Passive
Absolutely the worst airline operating today. On my flight to DFW from Las Vegas I guess the flight attendants were having a bad day because none of them smiled and they were rude. Granted everyone has a bad day every now and then but this flight crew were rude and snobby. Prior to boarding the plane the desk attendant called for boarding zone 1 but 5 seconds later made an announcement for all boarding which created a cluster because now everyone was in line. Returning to Vegas was just as bad although the plane we were on experienced delays due to repairs. I think I'll just stick with Southwest Airlines for my economy flights.,Detractor

ZRH-HEL-HKG-HEL-ZRH before and after Christmas. Price for this season cheap. Feels like a tale of two airlines. Within Europe friendly staff (some more some less but still good). Sandwich nowadays in Europe normal but fine. Neighbour asked for second round and was willing to pay. Was given additional one for free and even asked if he liked another one. Transit from Europe to Asia easy even with only short transit time. Long haul seatpitch ok. IFE good but very limited choice. Food okay. However still weird that one has to pay for everything between the meal services. Even crew seems a bit embarrassed about that. Cabin crew (except for one FA on the way back) is reserved some clearly showing that they don't like their job. One already knows when advertising states that water bottle in seat pocket in Y means no or only one drinks service during the flight.

"Together with my wife, I experienced Lufthansa's new personalised long-haul Business Class service on an A380 flight between Frankfurt and Los Angeles. Lufthansa's ambition is to become Europe's first five-star airline and measured by the new C-Class service concept, they will get there. The service was impeccable with the flight attendants competently managing the fine line between attentive and personal helpfulness and care â€“ and well-meant, if imposing suffocation of passengers. Kudos to the cabin staff. The food was the well-tasting and delicious food, best I've had on a long-haul flight, wines were excellent too. The cabin was well-appointed, colours pleasant, and lots of space for your carry-on luggage. The IFE programme was impressive (but this has become an industry standard, I guess), including the large screens. The not-quite-so-new fully reclineable (â€˜lie-flat') seats have been described by others. Since I've been flying on the South American services, which appeared to be the last to receive these â€˜new' seats, it was still a new experience for me. Hence a couple of words about the seats: they are certainly not bad. The foot-end is rather narrow â€“ perhaps too narrow for comfort â€“ and I don't really understand the reasoning behind it. Space in general does not seem to be missing. Another minor issue is the compartment under the in-seat entertainment monitor. This is where you find your kit with socks, toiletries etc. In our case, you couldn't close it properly, simply because it seemed to be poorly made (I've noticed it on a recent 747-8 flight, too). Flying on the world's biggest and heaviest passenger plane and then not being able to shut a compartment box somehow feels silly. But it's a detail that in no way spoils the general impression and, indeed, five-star experience.",Promoter

VIE-HEL on Oct 9 and return HEL-VIE on Oct 12 both legs in Economy. VIE-HEL on an A320 and HEL-VIE on an Embraer 190 both flights on time. Service on the VIE-HEL was lacklustre and it took the FA's almost an hour to get the service started. Sandwich (tuna or turkey and cheese) was actually quite large for airline standards and tasty one round of drinks served beer and wine for purchase only. After collecting the trash FA's went pretty much again into hiding mode. The aircraft on the return flight was changed from an Airbus to a smaller Embraer 190 â€œ operated by Flybe. Information was given only during check-in. Not sure what 'operated by Flybe'â€ means in practical terms but it was a Finnair plane with a Flybe sticker beside the aircraft door with Finnair service and Finnish flight crew. Probably just a move to bring salary costs down. I find Embraers to be very comfortable planes and flight crew was attentive on the flight back to VIE. Catering was a substantial green and noodle salad again tasty. Web check-in was smooth although during the check-in process for the return flight we were asked if we would volunteer to give up our seats as the flight has obviously been overbooked. But no further information was given regarding alternative flights and compensation so we obviously denied. Boarding in HEL was a bit chaotic and delayed with no information given. However staff managed to board the plane very fast so flight was actually on-time. AY uses a shared lounge in VIE which is spacious with a decent drink and hot food selection. However the snacks offered are of extremely poor quality. Schengen AY lounge in HEL has greatly improved with the renovations almost finished. Now that the lounge is substantially larger it has still been well visited but was not over crowded. Food and drink selection has improved as well and was quite good. All in all excellent product by AY but according to their in-flight magazine the free food and drink service will be replaced by a 'to purchase' product on European flights as of November.,Promoter

They close the counter 1 hr prior to the flights departure and no check ins or boarding passes are allowed. The guy also said that the names were not correct on the reservation. I asked him how I got there perfectly fine with no issues and the names were correct but Now they are wrong? The men at the check in counter could have cared less that I was standing there with two kids and no way home. They told me the supervisor wouldn't be back down until the flight left the gate. After he came down to talk to me, he stood behind the counter and waited for me do pick up all my bags and walk to him. I said ""no you need to come to me"". He came over and basically said that I was not compliant, that I was responsible to check in myself, and that there was nothing he could do for me. So I'm left standing there with with 2 young kids and no where to go and no desire to help. I was a hot mess. I went to enterprise to rent a car and spent 10 hrs in the car driving home. I will never fly spirit again. The crew inside the plane on the first leg of the trip was amazing! They just loved my babies. My oldest even got a picture with the pilot. But my way home was a disaster. I will be writing an official letter of complaint.",Detractor

"  Auckland to London via Hong Kong. At the time of booking their website had glitches that even their call centre staff struggled creating a booking. This was annoying and cumbersome. The call centre staff member that I spoke with was irritable and short in his responses. It became so bad that I asked to speak to his manager and only then did he become moderately professional. Then very to my huge disappointment he had altered my meal request to a special meal not of my choosing. The plane staff exchanged these unfortunate mistakes with only faint annoyance. Their newer aircraft was great. Comfy, spacious and good service. The older Boeing 777 was less comfortable and the staff were much less generous especially in regards to disallowing me to board with a car seat and umbrella stroller. These items were taken from me to be checked as I boarded and were lost for two days after my flight which made an extra two hours at the airport.",Detractor

"  Flew Reykjavik to Portland. I would agree with the past two reviewers. The airport at Reykjavik is dangerously overcrowded. After spending a very uncomfortable several hours in the airport, we were bussed to our airplane. Then, the plane sat on the ground for another hour while some kind of engine problem was fixed. It was unavoidable, and we did want to have it fixed, but the crew could have done a better job keeping us informed and perhaps doing something to ameliorate the ""hurt"". We flew economy. We were packed in like sardines. The food offerings available for purchase were hideously expensive and perfectly awful. So, if you fly Icelandair after reading this review and are not willing to pay for business class, be sure to bring your own food and drink onboard. (The wine was pretty bad, too). I would also suggest purchasing your own earphones at home, rather than relying on those available on-board. There were not enough flight attendants to be able to serve the full airplane in a very timely fashion, though they were very pleasant and tried to be helpful. I would love to be able to return to Iceland, but I'm not sure I could face another flight on this airline or through this airport.",Detractor
Feb 27 2014. When we original booked this flight from Toronto to Orlando return it was with Air Canada. When Air Canada up and decided to change the flights to Rouge there was no compensation for cost given as a refund or credit as Rouge is supposedly a cheaper flight. This fact was confirmed by speaking with other passengers on the flight who booked the flight through Air Canada Rouge. Not only did they not compensate us for the change they automatically changed our seating - splitting my husband and myself approximately 8 rows apart. I would also confirm that I had to prepay for seat selection. When I went to check in online the flight was sold out and I could not get my seat that I had paid for back. The new seats are horrible. I am only 5 feet and I couldn't get comfortable with the decreased leg room. I don't know how they expect people to sit in these seats for a 5 plus hour flight. They have taken out the TVs in the seats. They boast themselves as having a huge selection of movies etc. with their new app that has to be downloaded. Their huge selection is worse and older than Netflix. It really is a joke. If you want anything that is enjoyable make sure you download your own movies/shows before flying. Next time look at WestJet before booking Air Canada.,Detractor

"  Our flight from Sapporo to Bangkok on 1st April was late into Bangkok. We had a 55 min connection to catch TG409 to Singapore. I was flying with wife and 2 young kids. After we took off we asked about our connection in Bangkok and were reassured by crew the flight would be held as there were several passengers that needed to catch the connection. We landed 4.10pm, our connection was due to leave 4.25pm. There were no ground staff holding signs about our connecting flight and after 15 mins running through the airport with young family we arrive at departure gate to find it had departed. We were told no compensation was due as flight TG671 was delayed by fog on take off. It was a sunny morning in Sapporo when we took off - not a hint of fog. After 3 hrs we caught a later flight back to Singapore that was 40 mins late into Singapore. Thai Airways have a lack of organisation and information at Bangkok terminal.",Detractor
"  First, the boarding gate is gate 1 in Hong Kong, which is very close to the exit of the customs. The flight is on time, arriving at the gate of Incheon airport at around 5.44am. The flight is quite smooth. The seat is quite comfortable. Note that this A333 economy seats have a fixed shell. The seatback is fixed. So the seat cannot recline backwards. Instead, the seat kind of slides down. I quite like this idea. It means that the monitor will never be too close to you and you will not be annoyed by the one in front of you. The legroom is great. I fell asleep easily before taking off. About an hour later, the meal is served. I was a bit disappointed that the meal was not an ordinary full size meal. There is no choice of main course. Usually there are two for passengers to choose from. The food is put inside a rectangle paper box, the box is quite nice actually. There is a small bowl containing a few slices of fruits, orange, kiwi, pineapple and one more. There is a sandwich with something like mayonnaise, salad. And there is a biscuit. That is all. I do anticipate more, but probably this is an overnight short flight, 3 hours and 40 minutes, departing at 1am. So Cathay thinks it is better to give you a light meal with mostly vegetables. I would be happier if it was a full meal. The inflight entertainment was excellent. It offers a great variety of HK, Asia and western movies, TV programmes and music. And touch screen monitor is responsive. Unlike the one fitted on Hong Kong airline where you have to touch it ten times before the screen senses your response.",Promoter

Flight to SJC on an E175 was delayed an hour reducing my scheduled 2 hour meeting time at The Club in San Jose airport. The folks at the Alaska lounge put me on a later flight departing San Jose back to Orange county, saving my meeting. Flights were pretty empty on both flights, only about 25 people on each. Boarding was quick, early boarding for premium Economy. E175 seats are very wide anyway, combined with the extra legroom, very comfortable for a short 50 minute flight. Flight attendants served drinks quickly, Had a nice Pinot and a complimentary snack box. Later flight from SJC to SNA boarded and left on time. Same service, more wine and the snack box.

" Seoul to Kuala Lumpur. New aircraft but hardware was very dated. Seat is true-flat but not comfortable. In partially reclined position it provides no armrests. Tray table is unsupported and slants when the when the food tray is placed on it. A laptop will gradually slide off unless constantly repositioned. Window seats in the upper deck are more spacious than aisles which are constricted by walls and offer zero storage space accessible from the seat. The partition between seats is just plain awkward. Barely enough space to balance a drink precariously without deploying the slanted table. Pillow and blanket are economy standard, and not appropriate for overnight flights. IFE is substandard with few choices. Service is mediocre, hampered by poor English. Attendants have their rote routine but cannot cope with anything spontaneous like a change of wine with main course, water refills out of the designated timeframe, or drinks outside of regular service times.They are very polite but this does not translate into effective service. Ground staff at the Prestige check-in desk lack even this basic politeness, again, possibly because of a lack of linguistic skills in English. Wine selection is excellent but food is quite simply the worst I've had in a premium cabin of a full service carrier.",Detractor
"  Luton to Geneva. On 23rd February myself and my partner have checked in our luggage then went to the gate 11 as indicated in the screen TV in order to board the plane.

Milan-Rome-LA. Classica plus on long haul. Domestic flights good both ways and on time. Flight going to the US 18/7 was on time and in general a positive. Priority boarding at Rome nice and easy good start. Enjoyable flight with nice friendly professional cabin crew. Food was good. After all we were leaving from Italy (shouldn't make a difference but does). Large entertainment screen and audio were very good. Comfortable seat with that all important extra leg room. Nice on board kit with good quality blanket. Return flight to Rome from LA 9/8 and what a difference. Same airline but a very different and this time negative experience. After over an hr's delay at LAX boarding started where priority boarding just didn't exist! Once on board we were greeted with very rude cabin crew who could hardly smile! This continued for the whole flight. Just rude and couldn't care less attitude from the crew. Food inedible and cold.

HEL-HKG in J-Class. A disappointing experience overall. Flight about 60% full in J-Class. Cabin looks dated and generally feels like something out of the early 90s. Definitely not at par with today's standard offerings in Business Class especially if you are used to travel on CX SQ and QR. The seat was uncomfortable to say the least. The food was mediocre and there was no dine-on-demand service. The crew seemed bothered and at times even amused when you pressed the call button and asked for pretty basic things like a refill. No amenity kit provided. When asked for a comb and a toothbrush the cabin crew again seemed more annoyed than helpful and after a 'quick checking' told me that there were none onboard.

"The Emirates 777 is a disappointment compared to it's A380 services. The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out. Cabin service was generally of a high standard and meals provided were one decent and edible meal and a snack. I would fly with Emirates again, but at this stage I'm not sure what the fuss is about.",Passive

We travelled economy from Manchester to Toronto via Heathrow The flight from Manchester to Heathrow and return was very good. The seats had plenty of room and it was easy to fit laptop size briefcases under the seat in front and still have room to stretch your legs. The service from the cabin crew was excellent. The leg from Heathrow to Toronto was not as comfortable but it was acceptable. The seats appeared narrower and my case only just fit under the seat leaving little room to stretch my legs. Whilst the cabin crew forgot requests for drinks they apologised and were very friendly and helpful in other aspects. Unfortunately BA were let down by the attendants on the return leg from Toronto to Heathrow. Whilst the aircraft appeared newer and more comfortable I have never experienced such surly behaviour from the cabin crew. We had seen attendants in the opposite aisle offering passengers water from trays they were carrying but the attendants down our aisle did not do this. The lady in the seat next to me asked for a glass of water before take off. The steward was quite off hand and said he would bring her one in a minute. He did not do this and when she asked again she was told in a very rude manner that take off procedures took priority otherwise non of us were going anywhere. Even after take off she had to ask again. When they served dinner my daughter did not want a meal but she asked if she could just have the bottle of water that was served with it. The steward said that if she did not want the meal she could not have the water but that he would bring her some in a glass later. This had not appeared by the time I had finished eating my meal so I gave her the bottle from mine (My daughter has a medical condition that requires her to drink water frequently throughout the day) Shortly before landing we were served a muffin and a drink. The passengers on the other aisle were served about 15 mins earlier and they were handed paper napkins and cutlery whilst when we were served we were simply handed the muffin wrapped in cellophane but no plate or napkin to catch the crumbs. I asked for a glass of orange and a tea (as I had not drunk anything on the 6 hour flight).

Check-in in AMS was good and despite the fact the flight was at the start of the holiday season we had to wait only a short while to check-in our luggage.

Selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty. Boarding was reasonably efficient, and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks, pyjamas etc. Delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight. I opted to sleep straight after take off, seat comfort is okay if a little narrow. 90 minutes before arrival I had some fruits and pastry for breakfast, accompanied by some good coffee. While I only needed minimal service onboard, the staff were courteous and efficient, and they are one of very few good things left after BA after their CEO seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years! Arrival into T5 at Heathrow, B satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam, and a reason I would choose another airline on this route.

Flew KLM in 2013 and noted that 4 years later in 2017 KLM new Y seat of B777-300ER is narrower than the seats of 2013 and there was no footrest anymore which makes the long range travel less comfortable. But new excellent IFE with more choices of music and movies in several languages. Cabin crews were aged but very friendly, professional and enthusiasm throughout the flight. One hour after taken off hot towel was given before serving lunch. Quantity and quality of lunch in 2017 was average of Y class standard. After lunch duty free sales with great selections at attractive price (cheaper than Airport Bangkok). Unlike other airlines after lunch and duty free sale most of crews were still on duty and came often with soft drinks and ice cream during the rest time. Before landing at AMS we got 1 cold meal. After landing KLM crews still on â€œenthusiasm serviceâ€ helping passengers took out the cabin baggage/ saying thank you and goodbye with smiles. Negative points compare with 2013 is narrow seat and food/beverage. In 2017 we got only 1 hot meal (lunch) and 1 cold meal (snack) for 12 hours flight compared with 2 hot meals (Lunch & Dinner) in 2013 but KLM's enthusiasm cabin crews made these 2 negative points quit.

I arrived to the airport on time, tried to check in and was told that the flight was overbooked and they couldn't fit my onto the plane - but they would put me on the next available flight about 3 hours later. Feeling pretty bummed, I did a solid stint of airport people watching for a few hours waiting for my next flight back to Amsterdam. I was told by multiple staff members that I was entitled to a 250 euro compensation payment and could contact the customer service team in the next few days. I filed a claim through the Vueling site, received an email confirming my request for compensation, provided my bank details and then, radio silence. I've sent multiple emails asking for updates on my claim, even resorting to commenting on their facebook posts to try and get a response from anyone. It's been a month since my initial flight and so far Vueling have been avoiding me like the plague. Overall, a pretty frustrating experience to be honest.",Detractor

I was travelling with my 4 year old. My flight to Portland with connection at Denver was delayed 3 hours. First they said it was due to weather but then they said it was a mechanical problem with the flight. I was to miss my connection at Denver. They showed no empathy towards my situation but were rude in suggesting that the only option was to either stay back at Denver or fly the next day at 9 am. The next day they were so fuzzy about my baggage being overweight by 1 pound - the same bag they checked in yesterday but had to get back due to flight delay. They made me remove stuff from my bag and finally they lost my bag. Staff at Portland responsible for baggage claim was impossible. I am still waiting for my baggage to arrive and I am hoping I would get it back.,Detractor
"  You've probably heard it many times, but this is the absolutely worst airline I've flown. I fly all over the world for work and personal events. This trip was personal. Our flight was 2.5 hours late getting started. Reason given was late leaving Dallas. See my other review of their atrociously awful seats. Then we land and leave Minneapolis. As we are approaching Denver we are told we have to circle for a couple hours due to bad weather. Strange, since the other airline websites show all flights close to on time. When we get on the ground finally, we find people there who have been there more than 30 hours, due to cancelled flights on Spirit Airlines. They will be on our flight to Vegas. All other flights here in Denver are gone and on time. So they knew they were having problems before I even got to the airport this morning. As of this review I have been flying and/or sitting in an airport for over 12 hours for a 5 hours flight. They call themselves a cheap, low cost airline. By the time you've spent more than you would have on a real carrier you realize cheap means very low quality. I will never fly this airline again.",Detractor
"  London Gatwick to Arrecife, Lanzarote. I've been flying with Easyjet for about 7 years, mostly to the Canaries. Over the years, I could see a great deal of improvement in the service, food and aircraft. To begin with, there were three toilets on the plane that took us to Lanzarote and back, all of which had baby changing stations. The food was much better this time around than on any other flight. We opted for the meal deals, and were really impressed with the Corkers crisps and the hot food. They were far tastier than any other on-flight food I've had in over 10 years of flying with state-owned and low-cost airlines. The staff was very attentive, helping me with my baggage, and making sure that I'm aware of the facilities and safety features dedicated to infants. The flight attendants forgot to serve us some of the food, and it took about 15 minutes for the hot food to be served, but that's not something we'd hold against them, considering they were genuinely busy. There was a general sense of calm and consideration for other people, with passengers willing to overlook the noise and fuss our children made, and I believe that's down to how the staff carried themselves and attended to people's needs. There was a friendly atmoshpere throughout, which helped ease our anxieties over political unrest in the country, and especially attitudes toward migrants. The new Recaro seats are very comfortable and sleek, with plenty of legroom behind and underneath. I don't think low-cost could be much better than this.",Promoter
Just got back with Ryanair from Spain and not had this problem before but thought I will share what mistake I made. I got aÂ£Â£100 charge for baggage on return as I did not pay for both ways new one for me as I have always used the same way to book my Ryanair flights and never had this before?

Flew London-Dar Es Salaam via Cairo. Boarding was shambolic and done last minute. Waited 2 hours on plane before takeoff and we had a connecting flight in Cairo with 1 and a half hours transit time so obviously late. In Cairo although many of us were late for connections still had to go through 2 security gates. Rushed into our connecting flight that was waiting for us but it didn't fly until 50 minutes later. Meals were the same on both flights and were terrible. Staff were friendly but not helpful promising to bring water tea meals (I was fasting and needed a later meal) but never delivering.

The crew on the first leg were the most friendly and cheerful I've had on a flight even on a full flight and through very uncomfortable turbulence.

Flew Mint class from LAX to JFK in July. Check in and boarding smooth and on time. Fantastic crew helpful and kind yet unobtrusive. Meal some of the best I've had inflight much better than BA and QR business long haul. Entertainment system not AVOD so whenever announcements were made I'd miss parts of the film I was watching.

BRS-BCN-BRS. Flight out on 18/4/15 was excellent. Took off on time and arrived 20 minutes early. Plane looked to be a new A320 with new thin seats which were surprisingly comfortable and seemed to give plenty of room. Return flight on 2/5/15 was exactly opposite. Probably the most uncomfortable easyjet flight we've ever had (A319). Had seats 20 E & F which were extremely cramped. Luckily the flight left almost on time but with an extended flight time due to head winds it was the best part of two hours of purgatory. This won't stop us using easyjet but we'll make sure we don't have these seats again. Staff on both flights were efficient rather than friendly but you don't expect them to be your new best friends.,Passive

Washington Dulles to Beijing and on to Manila and return in Oct-Nov 2014. This was the most economical flight that I could find and I did not expect great seat comfort or great quality food. The boarding in Dulles was a mess. The majority of people on the plane were Chinese and non English speakers who queued up to board when there was some indication we would soon be boarding. The ground staff announced in English that we would be boarding from the rear of he plane and started to announce a range of rows. The people who had gotten in line saw people from the rear rows trying to board and started pushing to board because they thought people were cutting in line. The ground staff started yelling to stop pushing again in English. The ground staff finally got a Chinese speaker to make an announcement and restore some order.,Passive

"  Shanghai to JFK New York. I flew 8 flights with China Eastern between October 16 and November 2, six of these domestic flights within China on Shanghai Airlines, which is owned by CE. On the international flights planes were new and clean, with seating you'd expect in economy class. Meal and drink service were fine, but food quality was lacking. Noodles were extremely greasy and fish was very fatty, not appetizing. Another dinner consisted of eggplant (again greasy) and rice, with a side dish of a cold white pickled vegetable, plus a packet of 8 saltine crackers. No cheese or anything else with the crackers. Water melon for dessert. Inflight entertainment was odd, perhaps chosen solely with Asian passengers in mind. Baggage handling : the outbound trip checked my bag from JFK to my destination in Guiyang, with change of plane in Shanghai. In Shanghai I learned that my flight to Guiyang had been cancelled because of weather so about 4:00PM I and 10 others in my group were taken to a hotel about 15-20 minutes from the airport. At 9:30PM our tour guide knocked on each hotel room door to tell us that CE required us to return to the airport to claim our bags. Why? ""If you leave it overnight it may get lost."" We went. After Guiyang we headed to Wenzhou, again via Shanghai. We arrived in Wenzhou on a morning flight but bags did not. When would they arrive? ""Maybe tomorrow."" This seemed strange since there were two more flights the same day. In fact the bags reached our hotel shortly after midnight, probably arriving on the second of the two remaining flights that day. My TSA-approved lock was missing, but bag contents were complete. These experiences did not raise confidence in China Eastern's ability to handle luggage. End of my trip involved a flight from Guilin to Shanghai leaving Guilin at 12:10PM on November 2. At dinner November 1st our tour guide received a call informing us that our flight had been cancelled ""due to a change to winter schedules on November 1."" We were re-scheduled on a November 2 flight leaving at 7:30AM, the only flight of the day. This required leaving our hotel at 5:30AM. If winter schedules go into effect on November 1, why did CE sell us a ticket for November 2 using ""summer schedules""? And why was our guide only notified of the change the night before the flight? No traveler in our group received any email notification of the schedule change. We can only thank our tour guide that she had contacts that informed her of the change",Detractor

"  Gatwick to Lima return in Business Class. No choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra (I understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying Â£50+pp per flight if you aren't is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz). By the time we were able to check in, there was only one option left if we wanted to sit together. New BA lounge at LGW smart but packed out at the start of Easter holidays. Limited food offering at breakfast - no hot food at all, unless you count lukewarm pastries. FA service on flights in both directions was good, though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services, despite it being a day flight. Food and drink were fine but nothing special - some choices not available by the time they got to us. Seating layout of 2-4-2 in business class is very cramped, especially if the flight is full - the highest-density seating I've ever experienced in business - and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open. Small drawer at your feet. Recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo - no legs to climb over! Lie-flat seat was comfortable though for a short person. IFE was poor compared to competitors - hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available. On the way home we didn't mind a long layover at LIM as we thought we could use the lounge. No such luck - we couldn't be checked in all the way through from LPB so had to pick up luggage, go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before BA staff appeared to check in the flight home. Only seat choice available again were two together on the aisle side of a middle pair. Very fortunate not to have anyone in the other middle seat next to me, otherwise it would have felt very intimate with a total stranger! Haven't travelled long-haul with BA for several years and can only describe it as a functional, value service, even in Business, though it's not cheap. I'd only use BA again if they were the most convenient by a long way (as happened here for a direct flight from London), or for a great price on short-haul. There's really no comparison to Emirates' long-haul offering in Business.",Passive
"  Flew airBaltic from Geneva to Stockholm via Riga. Service onboard was ok. Fresh cabin on a 737 and leg space was not too bad because of the new seats. The problems started when reaching Riga 10 minutes delayed. Another 10 minute delay followed since there were no ground crew at the gate. Connection time to Stockholm was 30 minutes so we didn't reach the flight. Ground crew were in general not helpful and were rude at the gate, transfer desk and information desk. We got new tickets on another airline several hours later. We had to wait outside the security control since check-in didn't open until 2 hours before departure. They thought they had lost our luggage, which they had no clue how to locate.

When an attendant eventually arrived, after a very long time, he was rushed off his feet, as there was such a shortage of staff. On the return journey, I was almost reduced to tears. I rang from the booth for disabled assistance, and was assured someone would be with me as soon as possible. I rang twice more and both times was assured someone was on the way. Eventually, a very kind parking attendant went to investigate matters and someone arrived within 10 minutes, by which time I was almost passing out with the heat, as it was like sitting in a greenhouse with the sun beating down and I had waited an hour and a quarter! Again, the attendant was run off his feet through lack of staff and I had not even been checked in (so much for having to arrive 90 minutes before the flight!). As it was, the plane was late, otherwise I would have missed my flight. Having said all that, all staff were very civil, but it did turn my lovely holiday into a nightmare. If Easyjet are committed to helping disabled people have a smooth journey from start to finish, they need to get their act together and liaise with OES re passenger assistance, especially in this day and age. May I add that the cabin crews were most helpful, as were the OES staff at Edinburgh where the service is most professional.",Detractor
AC 1920 August 4th YUL-FCO. AC 1921 August 18th FCO-YUL. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown with. What a disappointment! Nothing is up to date old aircraft with no leg room. The application for personal entertainment kept on crashing. Worst food ever. Never again.,Detractor
"  Turkish Airlines is nice when everything goes right. However, if something goes wrong they are really terrible. Case in point, I recently flew from Houston to Dubai via Istanbul. Both flights were delayed by an hour. The onboard service was very good on both legs. Onboard the service is of a higher quality than that of US airlines. However, when we arrived into Dubai, all 3 of our bags were missing. Since both flights were delayed over an hour, there was plenty of time to transfer the bags. However, our bags didn't make it and apparently, neither did the bags of some other passengers who originated from Houston. Believe it or not, after a long flight from Houston to Istanbul, upon arrival you do not arrive at a jetway. You arrive at remote parking and have to take a bus to the terminal. This also has an impact on baggage and for this reason alone, I would not recommend Turkish. The resolution of the baggage has been awful. The only way to communicate with TK is via twitter. 2 of our bags have been found but one seems to be completely gone. In this age of barcode bagtags, I just do not see how this happens. I can't recommend anyone take Turkish Airlines based on my experience. They are horrible when anything goes awry.",Detractor
Very poor quality service. Lack of in seat entertainment on 5 hour flights even in Business class is simply unacceptable in this day and age.

After 15 minutes of sitting at baggage claim with nothing happening, a Public announcement was made that our luggage would come in 20 - 40 minutes. It actually turned out to be 50 minutes. So our whole plane of people had to sit around for an entire hour waiting to get our luggage. No explanation, No apology and Nothing more than one public service announcement. It sure didn't feel like they care about their customer. And it really seemed obvious that they forgot to staff for our flight coming in! Nice going Frontier! Not only is your pricing misleading...who buys a ticket thinking they will need to also pay for their seat? And your seats are so uncomfortable!

"Toronto - Buenos Aires packed Boeing 777-300 seat 4A. The intercontinental Maple Leaf lounge was very comfortable quiet with an adequate selection of snacks and refreshments. Boarding in Toronto was simply chaos a mob of people pressing toward the jetway.

Service Director was a gem very gracious. But the rest of the front cabin crew didn't seem to want to be there. Eye contact & smiles were absent and the environment lacked any genuine sense of welcome. We took off after midnight and I opted for the express meal which was adequate but not great. The lie-flat seat with duvet and pillow is very comfortable for a good night's sleep. Unless you plan to crane your neck in strange ways don't plan to be able to see out the window. Why were the pods designed to face the aisle? Plenty of overhead space but minimal storage space around your actual seat. There was a fair amount of trash (newspapers plastic wrappers boarding cards) from the previous flight around my seat and in the overhead bin. The bathrooms were in poor condition. AVOD choices were plentiful and the system was easy to use. In the hopes that this was simply an ""off night"" for AC I'd take this flight again.",Passive

" Tel Aviv to New York via Istanbul. Awful service on the Ground We had a family vacation, using Turkish airlines from Tel Aviv to JFK and then connecting with Copa. I won't comment on the flight or the service in the air, they were both great. But I was surprised at the ineptitude and lack of communication abilities of the ground crew, both in the Istanbul Lounge, and in the JFK transfer desk. My wife had the beginning of a cold on the plane and the eair pain was almost unbearable. Went to the Concierge at the Lounge to get some Ear Medicine, and they couldn't understand us. They sent us to the reception. Reception called the airport pharmacy, but couldn't manage to let them know what we needed. We waited for an hour for a pharmacist to show, and the liunge didn't care either way. They even complained that we should be grateful they were doing us a favor. Very dissapointed. But at JFK, it was even worse! We arrived after an 11 hour flight and had 6 hours to connect to Panama. We picked up our 8 large bags and 3 carryons, we go to the airline interline bag counter. The clueless agent they had, told us that they couldn't accept the bags. That Turkish only had an alliance with JetBlue and with United, not with Copa. We told her that our bags had been ticketed from Tel Aviv to Copa with a Turkish airlines bag locator, and she still ignored it. She insisted there was no alliance between Turkish and Copa. We explained they were both Star Alliance, and it was like she didn't know what that meant. A supervisor didn't want to come down to the desk, and said we had to go to Copa. The agent wouldn't even call the Copa desk to see if they were open. After 20 minutes arguing, we had to get 3 baggage carts, take the Airtrain to terminal 4, to find out the Copa counter wouldn't open for 3 more hors. We had to wait with the bags for 3 hours, having a bite to eat at a dinner. All because of Turkish Airlines incompetence, because obviously when we explained to the Copa supervisor what happened, they said Turkish should've accepted the bags.

"  Miami to Albany. I don't even know where to start with this airline company. I have dealt with issues since booking my flights for my honeymoon. The customer service is horrible! The first issue I dealt with when booking was over the phone. We wanted to switch our flights to a different time so we wouldn't miss our cruise ship. The flight we had originally booked was cutting it close. Ended up finding another flight (price was less than we paid) when we went to change the flights I had to deal with about 15 different people trying to tell me that I needed to pay more money for switching the flight. After days and numerous people we ended up just booking and paying the extra money. Be careful because if you go On the site and show that you're looking at a flight the price will raise from when you first looked at it. Next issue was coming home we arrived to the Miami airport. Checking into the flight the day before we got on our boarding passes a certain area to board. When we got to the airport, they changed the gate again and gave us paper boarding passes, then it got close to boarding time and we realized no one was boarding. So I looked on the app and it gave us another area so we rushed there realizing that was also the wrong gate. Our gate for changed 4 different times without being notified. So we ended up Missing our flight. The gate was on the other side of the airport. When talking to the customer service about switching our flight they were very rude telling us that their was nothing they could do and it was our fault that we didn't know. Never an apology or anything reassurance they were going to help us get home safe. Customer service is horrible with this company. I can't even believe what I have dealt with.

"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3.

The service is terrible you have to wait ages for anyone to attend to you. I think its because there are too many people. Stick with the 777 if you can. The IFE keeps hanging or the controls fail.

"Singapore to Vienna via Abu Dhabi wit Etihad Airways. For the money they charge, and their constant banging on about 'luxury' and 'premium service', this airline is a total rip off, unprofessional, unfriendly and really worth avoiding. I fly a lot and it takes a lot for me to go out of my way to avoid an airline, but that is absolutely the policy with Etihad now. No company could go further out of its way to breathlessly fawn over its business and first class passengers whilst utterly disregarding its other paying passengers other than to force-feed them constant marketing about how luxurious and amazing Etihad can be, if you're not a pauper in economy. Furthermore, they outsource major parts of long, international flights to low-cost airline partners to save money, meaning that you pay for a supposedly premium airline, but spend over 8 hours of your flight crammed onto a short-haul, low-cost airline plane. This is simply to code share and increase their margins, and is disgraceful. Am never, ever flying with Etihad again.",Detractor

Firstly my outgoing journey to BKK was pretty good - I have no complaints other than the usual for me not enough leg room (I am 6ft 3) however I am yet to fly with any carrier that I wouldn't say this about. The return journey was okay initially the flight left BKK on time and arrived in Abu Dhabi as scheduled. We boarded the Abu Dhabi - Manchester flight about 30 minutes late and were removed from the aircraft because of a 'maintenance issue' about 20 minutes after embarking. We were then told we could 'show our boarding pass to any of the restaurants in the departure lounge and we'd be able to get some food and a drink. Attempting this proved impossible I was told I needed a voucher from Etihad and wouldn't get anything unless I did. So a 25 minute queue for the voucher. Back to get some food. Oh the voucher only entitles me to what? A doughnut and a coffee! A 6.5 hr delay and this is all that was offered I was pretty disappointed and felt like this was in contradiction to Etihad's excellent reputation. We were eventually boarded on a flight some 7hrs later and whilst on-board the crew and staff were very attentive and professional. They provided a great service however the huge delay put a dampener on my return trip.,Passive
" Bangkok to Vancouver via Beijing. Our flight was good for the cost. A meal was served between Bangkok and Beijing (with a sticker left on the tray table if you were asleep during the meal so they would come back and deliver, very nice!) and the food was decent enough. English wasn't great but I don't expect that when flying between two Asian countries. The only reason this was a problem is that no immigration cards were handed out before arriving in Beijing and when I tried to ask what the process was for acquiring a tourist visa and immigrating, no one helped. I had done some online research so I knew one had to apply first for a tourist visa but it would have been nice to be able to fill the paperwork out on the plane just as I've done with every other country I've flown into. As a result, upon landing, very unhelpful ground staff misguided me into wrong line after wrong line and by the time I reached the proper line there was only seven hours left of my layover. Now this next bit has more to do with the Beijing airport than Air China. For some arbitrary reason, the visa officer would not let me enter the country because he felt I didn't have enough time. But if Air China had been more helpful in providing me with the correct information I would not have missed out on my Beijing tour and lost my money on it. Seven hours later, we boarded our flight back to Vancouver on a very old fashion plane where the seats were hard and uncomfortable and they woke us constantly with loud announcements about everything from ten seconds of turbulence to duty free shopping in the middle of the night. Made for a long, uncomfortable, sleepless flight after an extremely long and disappointing layover in the Beijing airport. All in all I would never recommend Air China or any flight that takes you through China as the ground staff in the airport are rude and the Internet is censored so you can't even do anything on the ""free wifi"".",Detractor

London Gatwick - Malaga return in economy class. Online booking was simple enough with extras available (seat selection extra baggage lounge access etc) at a reasonable cost after the booking was confirmed. My comments below refer to both the outbound and inbound flights unless otherwise mentioned. Check-in was quick and efficient with friendly staff. Oddly though check-in at Malaga opened just one and a half hours before departure despite their website suggesting that you arrive two and a half hours before. Boarding was pain free and organised with special needs passengers quietly loaded first with assigned seating there was no scrum.

" Frankfurt to Cancun via Atlanta. Flying in a freezer. Our experience with Delta was pretty mixed. Our flights from Frankfurt to Atlanta were not too bad. Food was okay. Ground service was great as Delta has a good boarding process which we really liked. The economy seats were a little bit uncomfortable if you compare them to other airlines. The IFE system has lots of films series and what not, Sadly you cannot adjust the angle of the screen which is not good as it is hard to see anything when the person in front of you pushs the seat back. The second segment from ATL to CUN was also okay and only a short 2hrs flight, same counts for the way back CUN to ATL. Then it all started...for the last segment we thought, lets go comfort and have better experience. We had seats in row 21 (E+F) next to emergency exit. It was horrible cold even with three blankets covering my legs, result of that was/is having a nice cold when arrived home. The blankets are joke btw. Also the ear plugs do not do what they should do. I have not tested the headphones as they have no ANC in economy so i used my own.

Didn't eat again but my friend had the eggs and he said it was awful. TG changed our seats before we left for Sapporo from 2 windows to the 2 center seats. Their reason - change of aircraft. Transit in Bangkok was fantastic. They had a buggy waiting to transport us to the lounge. As our original flight to Singapore was cancelled we had a 7 hour layover.

Business plus plan: Smoke and Mirrors. I just went on a business trip and took the opportunity of travelling with Ryanair on their new Business plus plan. Just as an aside I fly regularly with Ryanair (no choice) and usually book and pay for all the options so I went for 'all the options' in a package that promised a 'bit' more and cost 70 euros more. The flight was from Dublin to Nice (France). The offering was 1) Flexibility on ticket changes 2) 20kg baggage allowance 3) Fast track airport security 4) Priority boarding and 5) Choose your premium seat. So this was all pretty good and I bought into it all. I did not need to use #1. #2 is standard. #3 I wanted and at Dublin Airport there was a gate for this that put us behind people being let into the fast lane for clearance (no big deal). When it came to the return flight this was not an option. #4 is standard. However at Nice everyone was let through the check in at the same time (there were two queues) and most priority passengers were way to the back of the ensueing melee - all were then herded aboard a couple of busses so no priority. #5 is standard. Bottom Line: Business plus plan is a total fake intended to take more money out of business passengers without giving them anything.,Detractor

"  Calgary to Cayo Coco via Edmonton. I e-mailed, faxed and left messages everyday for 1 week. Not one word back, no validation for my horrible experience - nothing. Very poor company to deal with. What a waste of my money and time. My one and only bag between both me and my 15-year-daughter was forgotten in Calgary. We were horrified at the Cuba airport when the luggage carousel stopped and closed down with no bag. We had only what we were wearing and needless to say just coming from -30 degree weather we were quite appropriately dressed for -30 degree weatherâ€¦not +30!! We both felt very lost, angry and sad. This was our first time to Cuba which we took a year to decide where to go and plan and I just wanted to get back on the plane and go home. I filled out the missing luggage form at the airport and they said to talk to a Sunwing rep at the hotel. Upon arrival at the hotel the Sunwing rep had gone home for the day. I told hotel staff that I had no luggage and have no necessities and they told me they will send toothpaste and toothbrush which never did arrive in my room that night. Next day I talked with a Sunwing rep and they said they could give me $50 a day per bag missing. I told them there are 2 people for 1 bag as we shared the bag that is missing",Detractor

"  Houston to Brussels via Amsterdam. If things go wrong, you face an upward battle against limited options (flights), limited resources (costumer services, customer assistance). I paid 1700 euro for a comfort seat and they left me stranded in Amsterdam. No duty of care to be sure that I reach my final destination from the KLM side. Out the door the EU legal requirements. The plane out of Houston has an issue, KLM needs to get it fixed. Paperworks and repairs take 4 hours. Most passengers already miss the connecting flights before departure. Staff at the gate scare people away which see the issues coming because of their prior experiences. Before we fly, they have to get some drunken passengers of the plane including the one sitting next to me. Not even a Sorry Sir. Service degree as in nineties, AC dripping, cold all night, no new water bottle - I will fill it up for you Sir (really in comfort). Inflight entertainment system bad, no subtitle, breaks down and restarts issues etc. We get to Amsterdam. The whole 747 with connecting issues floods the service desk. They get annoyed by the passengers frustration, this situation ends up being hostile at the desk. The staff is well aware that due to end of holiday week KLM basically has no options to offer passengers. Air France is full, KLM flights are full, Speed train are full (see later train desk told me). They give me a regular train ticket. While waiting the same women as at the gate reiterates her problem of meeting her connection to the river cruise in Basel. I suggest to call Lufthansa desk immediately as the only option to meet her deadline. The Service women all get hostile towards me. While the train ticket system breaksdown again, I notice the KLM assistance going in the Lufthansa option eventually. I get a train ticket no date no hour only a destination. The service assistant write down the departure time of the train by hand. Insists seat is numbered and I need to make it on time. I file a claim for my luggage and hope to meet my train. No train that fits departure time on screen. Queue to the train desk - no this is a train ticket but one for any train. No Sir Thalys is full to Brussels. No regular train service, only this weekend works on the line. I find the Service desk in Terminal 2, have the 24 H desk of the Travel agency speak to the KLM rep. Travel agency insist KLM book me on the 8PM flight in Business, KLM refuses on grounds that there is awaiting list of economy passengers. With no drivers license I'm with one option left : 4 hours + trip of 4 trains, replacement bus service and taxi to Brussels Airport. So instead of the 10+ hours KLM, I arrive 21+ hours at the Airport not thanks to KLM though.",Detractor
"It was announced there would be two in-flight movies. First, most of those passengers who actually paid for a set of headphones found there was no sound. Then the movie suddenly stopped, then it re-started, then stopped and restarted at a much earlier stage, stopped. Eventually, it did run through to the end - but the various stops and starts meant the second film never ran, at all. The food provided was the worst aspect, though. ""Dinner"" was a minimalistic dish of chicken and rice, served with a bread roll, a miniscule salad (with no dressing, of any kind) and a small lemon meringue-type pudding. The ""snack"" was, allegedly, a ""salad sandwich"" - but actually consisted of a small, doughy bread roll, smeared with a layer of mayonnaise and containing three pieces of very thin, processed ""meat"", each less than 0.5 square cms. ""Breakfast"" was another small roll, this time, ""filled"" with a very thin slice of processed meat, a slice of aubergine and a slice of courgette, accompanied by a vanilla yoghurt and a small, stale chocolate muffin.",Detractor
Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.,Passive
I have flown with Air Baltic for many years and generally there are no issues with time keeping and technical faults. On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.,Passive
"Los Angeles LAX to Paris CDG with WOW air. This airline is cheap when your purchase tickets compared to other flights, however, after all the fees the price can be insane.

Meals are separate. It was a 9 hour flight and I had to purchase food. Stay away from this airline. On top of all the fees there is no entertainment at all. Not satisfied whatsoever.",Detractor
"  Birmingham to Keflavik return with Icelandair. Whilst the staff on board weren't unpleasant they certainly didn't go out of their way to make it a particularly memorable flight. They did what was required of them and dealt with any necessary questions but that was it. The announcements weren't that clear (although that could have been hampered by the noise of the passengers) and I was surprised no safety demonstrations were given, just spoken instructions and told to read the â€œin case of emergencyâ€ card in the pocket in front of you. On the return flight, F1494 Keflavik to Birmingham on Friday 28/10/2016, there was a male member of the cabin crew and he seemed far more willing to assist passengers than the female cabin crew did. One late arriving passenger wanted to be seated with her companion so they asked if there were any empty seats that they could move to? As there was only one vacant seat the male member of staff asked if a few people would be willing to swap seats so the late arrival could sit with their companion and after a brief game of musical chairs the problem was happily sorted out, whilst the female cabin crew just watched and gave an appearance of being unapproachable. As for the seats, they are narrow and not especially comfortable and if you're in an aisle seat you get the added problem of the cabin crew knocking in to you as they go up and down the plane as the aisle isn't that wide either. I wouldn't say Icelandair was the best company I've flown with but they weren't the worst and I'd probably fly with them again but maybe not on a long haul flight.",Passive

"I was very impressed by the extra service from all airline staff. I was on crutches with a broken foot and they offered to take me in a wheelchair between airlines and even to get my luggage. All airline staff was very courteous and concerned. However, I was very very offended at the end of the journey by a porter. The lady who took me to get my luggage realized that she couldn't carry my bag outside and wheel me as well, so she asked a porter to help, a Spanish speaking man. He literally picked up the one suitcase and wheeled it outside. The lady left me in the wheelchair to wait for my ride. The porter then turned to me and said, ""well?"" ""Well what?"" I asked. ""I work for tip!"" He said. ""I'm sorry I have no cash,"" I said. ""Ha! You have no cash?? I work for tip!"" He said again. ""Leave me alone,"" I said. He then threw my suitcase on the ground and walked away. At this point it was midnight, my foot was in real pain and I was really offended by this. I have no problem tipping porters, but this was a very different situation, as I didn't not ask for his help and it literally only took a moment of his time. The lady could not have taken me outside without his assistance. I will avoid the airline after this experience.",Passive

"Ryanair shows a total contempt for their customers. My partner and I arrived at the airport for our flight from Rome to Barcelona only to discover that with Ryanair you are required to check-in online or be charged at 45 euro fee per passenger! This wouldn't have been an issue if it were clearly stated in the confirmation email they sent when we booked, however it was only make clear in an email sent to us shortly before the flight. As we were travelling we had limited email access (which I feel is far from unusual when people are travelling). This is a pretty cynical way of extorting extra fees from their customers, as they know that a certain percentage of people will not receive the eleventh hour email and be forced to pay the fee or be stranded. We were arrived an hour and a half before our flight and they still wanted 45 euros to print two pieces of paper! The planes were unclean, staff rude, and the service horrible.",Detractor

Whilst the service was reasonably good I have never sat in such uncomfortable seats. The 11 hour 20 minute flight from Osaka to Amsterdam on a Boeing 777 was the most uncomfortable I've ever been. The problem wasn't the leg room which was similar to most economy cabins it was the width of the seat and the actual comfort of the seat - it's the first flight where I've experienced backache. When I transferred in Amsterdam to a KLM Fokker 70 to fly back to Leeds it was bliss the economy seats were like padded armchairs. I've made a mental note never to fly in a 777 again unless there's absolutely no choice and the journey is of extreme importance.,Detractor

" I flew Etihad last 16 September from Frankfurt to Manila via Abu Dhabi. From Abu Dhabi to Manila, that is about more than eight hours (8 hrs) flight. After about forty five minutes of flying, a full meal was served which I am assuming to be breakfast. I chose a chicken with noodles meal. To my surprise, the thin rice noodles contain two small pieces of chicken, and it was extra spicy (which was not mentioned by the stewardess). To top it all, the appetizer was a mixture of some vegetables with the same type of noodles with a sour-sweet-spicy vinaigrette! I did not eat the bread as it is too much for me. I ate a small amount of dessert. Then, more than halfway of the journey, I was getting hungry already (we are above Bangkok). I asked the stewardess if they are serving food again and I was told 'Yes!'. So, the food came and it was a choice between sandwich or noodle in a cup! I told the stewardess I want both as I am too hungry! I was told 'only one, and if there will be extra, I will come back and give you.' The sandwich is a pan with mostly tomatoes (Mexican-type flavor),I ate all of it as I am very hungry. Later, the stewardess came with the same sandwich, and I politely declined. This is more than an eight hour flight, and for passengers two smaller meals will be healthier than one full meal. If you had a breakfast at 9am, after five hours, you will feel hungry, and want your lunch. I just felt Etihad is not sensitive to these passengers. Please be a little generous and give healthy food.",Detractor

The Qantas Singapore lounge is fabulous but getting there and back all within the 90 minute turnaround, a shower and meal is impossible with the volume of people going there and the distances involved.

My flight was supposed to take off at 3:30 pm. The ground staff informed us that there is an issue with the plane and the waiting process began. Three hours after the wait we're notified that the plane will not be taking off and we will be put on another flight coming in at 7pm.

The aircraft was a short-haul A319 with only economy seats - narrow, uncomfortable, minimal recline (10Â°?) and no legroom. No onboard entertainment, not even a free newspaper. How can they call that business class? When I checked with the economy class, the only difference was that a free seat is guaranteed between the seats (2 x 3 across the aisle) - and, even then, much of the economy section was empty. So I paid a business class ticket for an economy class seat. To sell these seats as business class is not just misleading, it is downright dishonest!",Detractor
"  London Gatwick to Toronto via Keflavik. The overall journey was fair and comfortable. Inflight crew were friendly and did try their best to accommodate my needs. I eat Hindu Veg Meal (HNML) or as some airlines call it Asian Vegetarian Meal (AVML), which I do specify during the booking. But in this travel I failed to specify my dietary needs. This was a bit challenging for air steward, so as to manage some vegetarian option for me. Unlike economy class, where food had to be purchased during flight, my business class travel (Saga class) made it mandatory for them to ensure I am well fed. Food quality was fine, nothing extraordinary in it. However I did like the alcoholic beverages list. Overall food, I could say was just fine. Emirates, Jet Airways and Air India economy class, some times pull off better food than them. They do provide with in flight WIFI service for business travelers, which I found was of decent speed - it was enough to check your respective emails, check news, scroll Facebook and use messaging apps like WhatsApp. The seat was comfortable, but no flat beds or anything - much like premium economy seats in Virgin Atlantic, British Airways etc. Leg room was fine, but not a business class experience there. Felt like I was flying in some domestic airline, rather than international travel. I did enjoy a modest transit at Keflavik international, only to find that their business class lounge was located after immigration. Hence in transit section, there is no facility which covered business class passenger needs. This was a let down. Adding to the problem was language issue. English was not their primary mode of communication and ground staff were not very well versed in communicating with passengers, in what I believe as good and hospitable way.",Passive

"  My partner and I were returning from a trip from Asia, a 15 hour flight. We were to get a connecting flight in EWR with Air Canada and return to YYZ at 6pm. We made it to EWR with plenty of time to spare and as we were in line to check our baggage, we get a notification that the flight had been cancelled with no further information. There was an AC employee in the area and we asked her about the cancelled flight, she mentioned in passing that the flight got cancelled all the time but we needed to stand in the assistance line to figure out what to do next. We got in line and there was only one rep dealing with an entire cancelled flight. One would think that if a flight gets cancelled, the company would bring on more staff. So, after waiting in line for nearly 2 hours, mind you there were only 4 or 5 people ahead of us, we finally got to the rep, who was incredibly dismissive and borderline rude to us. We were told that because of weather, the flight was cancelled, no other information other than that. I can accept weather can cancel a flight but based on our experiences and the information I found, I suspect we were being lied to. I asked if there was any other information and all I got was a blunt 'No'. All they could do would be to put us on standby for a flight at 9.35pm and we would have no idea if we could get on that or not. If that failed, the next flight we could be on was 8.35am the next day. When I asked if there were any other airlines that AC could put us on, a blunt 'No'. When I asked if AC would put us up in a hotel, another blunt 'No'. When asked if there was any compensation, he blurted out 'nope' in almost a happy way. Absolutely horrible customer service. My partner has priority pass, so we thought we could wait in the AC lounge. We showed up at the lounge, tried to get in, the rep there informed us in a way that he almost seemed to take pleasure from, that the lounge was only open to priority pass members until 3pm. The next flight, ended up getting delayed, we asked the rep at the counter a couple times if there was any status on the standby list, the last time we asked, which was close to 11pm, they told us they would tell us in two minutes, 30 seconds later they called out at list of names, didn't explain what it was and left us completely in the dark. It turns out that everybody that was on standby, except for us got a seat on the plan. When I went up to ask what was going on, they told me that the plane was full, maybe, just maybe if we waited a little while longer, we might be able to get on. It turns out there was another couple waiting on standby that had already been bumped 4 times before us that day. We waited until probably around 11.30pm. The rep found that two people hadn't checked in so we did have seats! He rushed us on board and we got into the first two seats that were available, they happened to be in business class. They seemed a bit confused at first and then realised that the tickets were for seats in economy, the first rep told us not to worry about it but then this horribly unfriendly flight attendant came up to us and told us that we we would have to move. We said okay, grabbed our belongings quickly and started to look for our seats, at this time the flight attendant yells out at us 'just take your seat, we'll sort it out in the air' - well that's great, she is the one that forced us to move, meanwhile embarrassing us in front of everybody in the plane. Awful experience.",Detractor

The cabin crew of EVA Air really care about the passengers' needs and feeling. They really stands on passengers' shoes to deliver their fantastic service.

As the only airline operating direct flights from Europe to Bujumbura (Burundi) I have flown SN Brussels Airlines many times over the last 5 years.

Before take-off the flight attendant adressed us by name and checked if the special menus were correct. The vegan food we ordered was some of the best airline food we have had.

ORD-VIE-DEL and return. When we travelled last December the interior of the plane was renovated hence it looked like a brand new plane. They went out of their way to take care of my son. The food was as decent as can be expected from airline food. New entertainment system/ brand new seats (with good leg room) Great service. As a frequent traveler to Asia I have tried most airlines for the long haul flights and I have to say Austrian stood out mainly due to the brand new interior but also due to great service. Last but not least have to talk about VIE airport. Of all the airports to have a 5 hour layover this might be one of the best. Lots of big couches available for take a quick shut eye with free WIFI. The reason for me try this airline was due to their excellent price but this year unless prices unfairly high I am going to book Austrian again. Highly recommended for the long Asia flights.,Promoter
"Check in at IAH was quick although we were overweight 1lb in one bag and were forced to transfer a jacket to the other underweight bag. I guess rules are rules but I wish United were as stringent in applying their carryon rules. The usual kerfuffle with too many/oversized carryons was experienced on the domestic leg. The FAs handled this situation and the service during the 100% full flight efficiently. Our flight to Sydney was delayed a few hours due to the late arrival of our aircraft but we were kept up to date with the situation by email and gate announcements. Another 100% full flight but boarding via the United group system works well and there was little aisle congestion, apart from the usual oversized carryon bag problem. The FAs were great the whole flight. Nothing seemed to be a problem. Water runs were frequent. The food for both dinner and breakfast was passable although serving/collecting the breakfast 90 mins before arrival on a full flight is rushed. This resulted in the hand out of the landing cards during the descent which is not optimal. especially for families. The IFE worked well with a great selection of movies and TV programs. The toilets were kept in reasonably good condition the whole flight. Seating in economy is tight and becomes a little hard after some time but you get what you pay for. My experience is that E+ is not worth the extra money even on a 14 hour flight. Another satisfactory experience with United Airlines.",Promoter

Most frustrating travel experience traveled from DC to Honolulu trip planned paid for fewer stops and earlier arrival leaving DCA boarded plane on time then proceeded to sit on a boarded full plane for 1.5 hours because there was an overlooked routine mechanical issue preventing the plane from regulating the cabin temperature.

" Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish. Even at cruising altitude, the flavours and aroma of the dish was well preserved. I highly recommend the SIA Business Class - best in its category.",Promoter

"Boston to Aruba via Miami. Once again flew American Airlines and once again we had problems. What everyone else is saying about this airline is true. The plane used from Boston to Miami looked nice and new from the outside, but it's a whole different story on the inside. Inside the aircraft, the interior is horribly outdated and not clean at all. The plane smelled horrible the whole way. Worst of all, there is no in flight entertainment. Large TV monitors every few rows and the one closest to me wasn't even working! The seats are so uncomfortable and the leg room is virtually non-existent. Many of the seats show wear and tear.

"This was our first time taking American Airlines. My fiancÃ© and I were flying to Vietnam. At check in, we provided all of our necessary info and errors popped up with our flight. At first we thought it was due to our passports but the airline supervisor insisted it was their system. They just couldn't find us in the system even though we had our itinerary. She couldn't provide us a clear answer as to why we had errors in our flight. It didn't make sense since we were traveling with 4 other people going to the same destination and they went through check in just fine. We stood in line with the check in agent on the phone for 2 hours! Apparently she had to call every connecting flight we were taking. All the while she barely updated us on what was going on making us ask her for updates. All we received were $100 vouchers each for American Airline tickets that had to be used within the year. We had missed our flight and they had to rebook us for the following day. Note, our original tickets were purchased online and we paid extra money to be seated together. The rebooked tickets did not have any of our seats together! We asked the agent at the gate to please sit us together and she refused. She couldn't even try to move people around? We've taken other airlines where they happily moved people around so we could sit together and succeeded. I will never take American Airlines again!

"DY2514, LGW-CPH / DY7011, CPH-JFK. Arrived last night from London via CPH on Norwegian and the experience was again positive save two points. Both flights were slightly delayed by 10-15mins but arrived on time. Online check in via the Norwegian app from LGW was great, the self tagging and bag drop all worked a treat. Boarding organized and surprisingly fast. 737-800 looked new and clean. The free onboard wifi was fast and greatly appreciated. Seat comfort and legroom was fine considering the length of the flight. Service at counter and onboard seemed friendly enough. Point one -It was unfortunate that there is no through-check in with Norwegian which meant, upon arrival at CPH, going through immigration, getting bags, clearing customs and checking in again and doing that whole security rigmarole for the JFK flight. The boarding on that flight was orderly though very slow as it was a full flight. Once airborne, the crew were friendly and pleasant. Both meals ordered were served and decent. Point two - While the much touted IFE system is great the selection of movies and TV shows available was very limited and dated. Seat comfort and legroom is reasonable. Takeaway - For the price Norwegian beats out a lot of 'full service' airlines. It doesn't feel as 'cheap' as other LCCs. Pack your own snacks, blanket, cushion if you need and your own device with entertainment and you are set. Would certainly fly them again.",Promoter

As I get on the plane I notice empty overhead bins everywhere and as I am walking down I see that a majority of the bags are small personal items. Purses, small backpacks, plastic bags. So basically I had to check my bag because United fails to enforce policy and as well prematurely calls the aircraft ""full"". The whole point of me traveling light is so that I do not have to check my bag as this is one of the biggest headaches about traveling.

" Boston to Marrakech via Lisbon. I experienced significant delays, cancellations, and unexpected fees on all segments of my round trip on TAP Portugal. I am primarily disappointed by TAP's disorganization and lack of professionalism in resolving delays and cancellations, rather than the delays and cancellations themselves. My flight from Lisbon to Marrakech was delayed for over 4 hours with no explanation or apology. The airline did not inform us that our flight would be delayed until its originally scheduled departure time, and they did not give an estimated time for departure until the flight was already delayed by 2 hours. Even after they allowed passengers to start boarding, they made priority boarding members (elderly, children, families, and people with disabilities) wait on a crowded bus in between the gate and the plane for over 20 minutes because our plane was still not ready. I thought I would be allowed to take one free checked bag, according to the TAP website (traveling from the U.S. to Morocco). My friend who arrived a few days later than me also traveling from the U.S. on TAP was allowed one free checked bag without question, but for some reason, I was required to pay a fee of $90 for my checked bag. I submitted a complaint after my flights to Marrakech but received no response. I also paid a total of $100 for my round trip seat selection, only to have my selected seat changed unexpectedly on the way back from an aisle seat next to my travel partner in a row of 2 seats to a middle seat in a row of 4 seats, 10 rows in front of my travel partner. On outbound leg of the trip, my travel partner also paid an extra fee for an Economy Comfort seat only to show up to the airport and be assigned a regular Economy seat. When I arrived to the airport 2 hours before my return flight from Marrakech to Lisbon, we were informed by other passengers that our flight to Lisbon was canceled. At no point did we ever receive any electronic updates from TAP or in person communication from a TAP representative about our canceled flight. There was no explanation or information about rescheduled departure times. We had to wait for over 2 hours in a customer service line to rebook our flights. TAP is also not certified for U.S. pre-check or Global Entry, a minor convenience compared to the rest of my travel difficulties with TAP Portugal.

"  I was flying from Colombo to Bahrain via Sharjah with my 8 weeks pregnant wife. Firstly, the flight from Colombo to Sharjah was delayed for about 4 hours which led in missing the connecting flight to Bahrain. Any normal airline would at least provide passenger with correct information. At Sharjah airport (which is another part of terrible story), none of the staff had clear information. The pathetic level of customer care was seen particularly by ""Help Desk"". I was even given an answer by staff on the desk upon asking when is the next flight ""any when!!"". There was nobody present at the desk to reserve us a Hotel even. After going around like headless chickens, I found out that the flight would be in the same evening at 5:50pm. I was told that no need to get new boarding pass you will fly on the same boarding pass. At around 5pm, after sitting on chairs at Sharjah airport in miserable and uncomfortable environment, I was given another news. That the flight is actually full and we will be given 2nd priority if the passengers from connecting flight miss this connection. I even noticed that there were passengers who bought this flight on same day, were told by the staff to just ""wait and we will call you"" meaning they were not let to stand in the queue for boarding. This clearly shows the mentality of the airlines where they have made their money and let the poor people be as stand by. After me literally begging the boarding assistant and explaining him my wife situation, he let us go on the plane and luckily, our luggage was also gone through to be on the plane. I appreciate the help of the guys, but this should not have happened in the first place. It was not my fault that the flight was delayed from Colombo. Even the pilot admitted that it was out of their hands. At least offer us a free meal for goodness sake! The general views of public about airline and Sharjah Airport were quite obviously true. Also, the aircraft is not up to the scratch with other competing airlines in region like Gulf, Oman, Saudia etc. There is clearly a hopeless attitude prevailing throughout this airline management. My first and last ever experience of Air Arabia! I hope I get a refund because I am happy to prove each and every incident that happened in this episode.",Detractor
"An 8 hour flight from Abu Dhabi to Kuala Lumpur with Etihad Airways. left an hour and a half late due to heavy traffic and then a passenger falling ill. Never easy waiting so long to depart, but the cabin was nice and cool. Seated in something like 38C with an empty seat beside me. The service was excellent, crew were attentive and friendly, the Bloody Mary was made with Tabasco and Worcester. The dinner was okay, though the chicken rendang had run out and only the fish and vegetarian noodles were available. Who would have thought, that the chicken would be more popular than the fish? Seat was comfortable, the inflight entertainment had a decent variety of shows. It's a decent airline, and they fly A380s. Abu Dhabi is a bit dated, but looks like a new terminal is appearing. Had to take a bus out to plane, it's a bit third world.",Promoter
"Flew from London to Seoul via Frankfurt and back. Both legs of the journey had short change over times and both times the flight was delayed, meaning a stressful sprint across one side of the terminal to another. Onboard, there were plenty of drinks being offered and the cabin crew were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were the hard, flat seats and the boring entertainment options (only 3 Korean movies were offered even though 95% of the passengers were Korean. I noticed others were bored too). I sat near the toilets and never saw a flight attendant cleaning the toilets, which were dirty towards the end. Overall, it is excellent value for money, cheaper than other competitors served by excellent cabin crew.",Promoter
I have flown several flights with Avianca - within Colombia (Bogota San Andres Cartagena) and international (Bogota-Madrid). Planes have always been clean food has been good and flights on time. On all flights domestic and international the turn out of the crew has been exceptional immaculate uniforms and grooming - A sense of pride which is something that I see less of in European and American Airlines that I have flown with these last years. Only issue I have had was being turned out of the emergency exit seat on a domestic flight when the crew member briefing me on the emergency procedure for that row discovered I didn't speak Spanish. Since most the passengers did not speak English there was not much I could say really. Of all options available from London to Bogota (and that's quite a few but none direct unfortunately) Avianca from Madrid is my preference. A good all round airline with exceptional crew turn out and service in my experience + prices are good.,Promoter
LHR-BKK-LHR. I've used Eva for approx 10 years the inflight service has always been ok. The IFE System is ok nothing compared to Etihad or Singapore. The reclining seats in Elite are very good. The food though was the worst I've ever had on a flight. I had seat 23C on both trips. There was water orange and apple juice available throughout the flight with sandwiches and nuts brought around the once. Midway on the flight I strolled to the back of the plane to have a stretch. For the price I would always recommend Elite Class.,Promoter
"Buenos Aires to Mexico City. I requested Aeromexico Plus seats but when at the airport my seat was taken. People at Buenos Airport were kind and solved it as the aircraft was not full. The price for this upgrade requested and paid in Mexico was higher than what was offered to me in Buenos Aires. Service onboard is poor. Dinner was served and only a few minutes after the flight attendants came by to pick up the tray. Not enough time to eat. Once I had finished I called to have the tray removed from my seat, and it took a long time until this happened. Many smiles, no service.",Passive
" Some days ago I made 2 bookings for a trip from Athens to Dublin and later on (the same day) I realised I needed to change the flight dates (and so I did) and proceeded to do it in the 24 hour grace period that Ryanair proclaims that it provides for this kind of changes. However, I was charged an extra total of 80 euros for both bookings (40 euros for each booking - 20 euros for each flight), although the old and new flight prices were exactly the same at the time of the change to the booking! Moreover, the aforementioned change happened in the 24 hours grace period (actually it was done less than 2-3 hours after the original booking). According to Ryanair's website and the 24 hour grace period (for this kind of changes) the dates change should have been at no cost (as the price of the flights at that time was exactly the same). I initially tried to address the situation with Ryanair's Live Chat customer assistance. But not only were they not helpful at all or even willing to try and check the reason for what happened, but they were also abrupt and rude. And of course no attempt at all at even pretending in trying to resolve my issue. Unfortunately, I have been a regular customer of the airline the last couple of years and I thought that if I address this matter through their website and the complaint forms (which by the way, good luck finding the proper link and form to submit one), that maybe they will be honest and upfront about the unfair charge and sort it out as soon as possible. I even sent them printscreens from the original flight prices (taken at the time of the booking and of course the new booking charges). However, the only reply I got back from Ryanair's customer service was a repeated standard reply prewritten form saying that the prices on the website are live and they may change at anytime (no one argued against that - however they don't even mention the fact that the prices were exactly the same) and that there can be a fee for changing the dates (no mention of the 24hour grace period). I confronted them replying to all these nonsense and they sent me the same reply, only to finally add the fact that once they receive a payment they cannot provide any refunds for any mistakes concerning the payment received (Great business policy, right?). Never trust Ryanair for anything. They prove to be one of the worst scammer airline companies there is.",Detractor

"  I flew from Paris to Edmonton via Reykjavik alone with a 2 year old and a 5 year old. As it was the shortest traveling time available, I took the risk even with reading bad reviews of Icelandair. I just needed something that was fast so it didn't tire me too much with my 2 kids, my 10 hour flight turned into a 24 hour flight. Flight delayed causing me to miss my connection flight. Long queue to rebook connection flight and ending up booking my 5 year old in a separate aisle (who in the right mind does that?) - getting stranded in Reykjavik for 1 night. Airline booked us in a bad hotel where I had to share 1 bed with my 2 kids - with horrible food as you had hotel food vouchers only (Centerhotel). Back the next day only to get another delayed flight. I have 2 kids - they gave us 1 infant meal so I asked for another one and they said they have no extras and couldn't come up with a solution on what to give my 2 year old, even if I had said she eats everything - it was just no. Wifi not working. I had about 3 people around me from different Icelandair flight complaining about their hell experience with the airline as well. In edmonton when i arrive the next day no luggage. I asked the staff why the flights were delayed and why my baggage got left behind, their answer ""we dont know and we are sorry for the inconvenience"". I ask the service counter to rebook my return flight as I had lost a day due to the delay - after 15 minutes of waiting and counter staff talking to the sales desk on the phone - the answer I get is ""please visit the website and call the number there as we cannot do anything for you now"". Its a shame there are no negative ratings to choose from, as Icelandair don't even deserve level 1.",Detractor
Flew from Ft Lauderdale Airport to Chicago O Hare. It was a morning flight so experience a mile long wait at the TSA counter in Ft Lauderdale airline cannot be blamed for this. Booked this flight because it was cheap and since we were doing a lot of around the country flights Spirit really saved us some money. I was really satisfied with the flight slept through most of it the flight was cramped with no inflight entertainment but that did not bother me much. I know most people complain about the extra charges but if you plan your trip right at the start with spirit it is actually quite a good experience. We flew back to Las Vegas using Spirit and I found that experience to be good also no delays in either flights. Overall will fly Spirit again.,Promoter

"I just returned from a a month long trip throughout east Asia with the major part of trip - across Canada to Vancouver and then across the Pacific with Air Canada. I have done this trip many times in the last few years but this year was particularly bad. I am a tall person and the tiny regional jet to Vancouver was bad enough with cramped seating and small overhead storage but the long haul across the Pacific was particularly uncomfortable. Clearly AC can order their planes with the seating configs they prefer so with 40-50 seat rows they can easily squeeze in another row in by trimming off a 1/2"" from each row making leg room just that little bit less. Heading out from Vancouver the food was decent but the movie selection was pretty poor. No major current releases and a lot of older stuff. As a result of travelling extensively in the Asia region I must have been on 6 or 7 airlines and when it came time to head home to Canada I had plenty to compare Air Canada to. When it comes to national carriers like Egyptair (Jakarta to Bangkok) or Thai Air (Bangkok to Shanghai) Air Canada doesn't even come close. On the return flight to Canada the plane was an older B767 with the same cramped seating as before. When I checked out the movies they were the same ones that were listed over a month earlier. This time the food was really bad. I usually eat what the airlines provide given it was such a long trip but this time I had to push it away unfinished. Somewhere during the night they passed out some tasteless sandwich rolled up in a plastic wrapper. It is shameful for Canada's national carrier not to have the best on such a crucial route for international business. I expect to be making this trip again and I will make every effort to make my connections with another carrier.",Detractor

"  Cleveland to Sao Paulo via Toronto with Air Canada. We faced countless problems from the moment we started our journey to Brazil. We were scheduled to take off from Cleveland to Toronto on June 23 at 5:50pm. To then take Toronto to Sao Paulo on flight AC 0090 at 10:40pm. When I scheduled the flights, we gave ourselves plenty of time in between to go through customs and ensure that we made our flight to Brazil, as I had work meetings and an interstate flight to Rio de Janeiro on Saturday morning. The first problem we faced was our flight from Cleveland to Toronto was late arriving. There were problems with the flight or weather issues - no one really knew what was going on. We did not take off until 10pm - which didn't put us in Toronto until 11:15pm. This made us and at least 50 other people miss their international connections. Air Canada was able to put us in a hotel for that night and we were to come back the following evening for a 8pm flight to Sao Paulo, putting us in Sao Paulo now on Saturday morning at 9am. I was able to move my meeting in Rio and also called the airline to reschedule my interstate flight from Sao Paulo to Rio. We got to the airport Friday evening for our flight that is meant to take off at 8pm. We are supposed to be boarding at 7pm and there is still no plane. We were then told that the plane won't take off until 11pm and after more time told it won't take off until 9am the next morning. This now creates problems for my business meeting in Rio. After working with Air Canada customer service (who were not polite) they were able to change our flights to Rio instead of Sao Paulo so we could make our work meeting. By this time it was already 3am and if we had gone to the hotel we would have to turn around and leave 2 hours later to come back - so my husband and I slept at the airport. This was exetremely uncomfortable and we had an awful night of sleep. We finally got on the plane on Saturday morning at 9am (supposed to take off at 9:15 so we were late again) and we sat on the plane for 40 minutes with no movement. They finally announced over the speaker that there is a passenger on the plane who shouldn't be - and security was there to remove him. After an hour and a half of being stuck on the tarmac we were finally left for Brazil. We were supposed to leave on Thursday evening and weren't taking off until Saturday morning.",Detractor
"Everything went well and flights were all on time. On the short flight to Munich from Frankfurt, we were served Leibniz Minis during boarding and inflight, were served only drinks. This wouldn't happen on an American based airline. Once in Munich, you have to walk to the ""H gates"" for flights to USA, which means you have to go through passport control. For my flight to Newark, you have to go through another security screening right near the gate, where you and your carry-on bag are thorougly searched. The A340-600 is a beautiful aircraft and the flight could not have gone better. All the flight attendants were attentive, very friendly, and spoke mostly English on flight to Newark. You were served many choices of drinks throughout the flight, given crackers, meal choice was between Cheese Ravioli with Spinach and Beef, and were later given something before arrival. The seats were comfortable and inflight entertainment had a good selection of movies, shows, games, and music. My only two issues were at check in, you do everything yourself (weighing, tagging, and placing luggage on belt) and during boarding, it was pretty chaotic. I must also say pay for the seat selection. It's worth it if the flight is oversold. I recommend Lufthansa for travel to Germany and beyond.",Promoter

Inflight service was about the same as other premium Asian airlines. Food selection and taste was okay, movie selection was typical near new movies and a few classics, with screen size was about the same as competitors. A big plus was noise canceling headsets on the TPE-LAX segment. Seat for Economy was good, for Premium Economy felt a bit uncomfortable - despite more leg and thigh room, when reclined, our legs are hung at the calf. A foot rest would be a good addition.

"  Recently took Norwegian for a trip to Europe. We went New York to Paris roundtrip. As far as budget airlines go, I would put this toward the top end of the spectrum. The planes are new and nice, IFE systems are top-notch, and service is pretty good as well. That said, keep in mind that even though things look sleek and well put together, you are still flying a budget airline and everything cost something. Of course, that is a given, but I was a little surprised when they didn't even offer water on a 7hr transatlantic flight. Also, they really push their duty free sales prior to landing - even going as far as turning on the cabin lights an hour and a half before landing, so you can see what they are selling. All that said, I do think the cheap ticket prices and new planes make it worth the flight - just know what you are getting into. Here are some helpful tips that I learned from my flight: Norwegian is very strict about the weight of carry-on bags, going as far as weighing every bag you are carrying (including purses and backpacks). Make sure your bags are no more then 10KG or they will make you check it. Buy food for the flight before getting to the airport and bring it onto the plane. That said, don't bring anything that will require hot water or rehydration (eg - Ramen/Cup of Noodles), as they will not give you the hot water, you'll have to buy it. If you do want to buy food onboard, do not reserve a meal before the flight, it's $45. Instead, buy the meal or snacks from the IFE system, it will only cost $14. Note that they might run out though. Boarding in NYC was quick and efficient, however boarding in Paris was a mess with staff losing control of the process creating a free-for-all to get on the plane. If you are picking a seat, do not pick the bulkheads. We sat in row 7 on the JFK-CDG flight, and even though we had extra leg room, the seats were extremely narrow and a bit hard. On the CDG-JFK flight we sat in row 13, which seemed to be a few inches wider, softer, and leg room was sufficient.",Passive
Eighth round trip with Ethiopian (EAL). The good - the B787 service from IAD-ADD-JUB in a mere 19 hours which is blazing fast. The con's - one flight cancelled outright without notice which added 6 hours to my trip. Another flight on the 13NOV14 trip suffered a weather delay of 90 minutes at IAD due to fog in the morning. The result was a 09:04 arrival in Addis for a 09.50 flight to Juba which was still on the ground. Five of us needed to make that connection and expressed this to the staff but the did not prioritize our exit from the aircraft. We approached four different airport employees and were met with varying degrees of indifference and inaction. Finally arriving at Terminal 1 (for regional flights) the aircraft that had been there had left. No flights for Juba were listed either as boarding or for the rest of the day. No gate agent here and security agents and lounge staff directed us to Immigration to locate one. Got back to Terminal 2 and onto a flight to Entebbe and a connection there to Juba.

Flew Business class Doha - Hong Kong Round-trip. Both flights departed on time cabin crew were attentive and friendly. My Muslim meal request was honoured. However I opted for a window seat to look outside the cabin. Unfortunately it seems that CX has a policy of keeping window shades closed throughout the whole flight hence eliminating the purpose of window seat and the enjoyment of flying. I do not recommend flying with this airline if you enjoy window seat. I am a business class passenger and I expected to be treated with respect. Unfortunately this was not the case for me hence encouraging me to fly Emirates and Qatar Airways.,Detractor

" The departure out of MEL was delayed by almost an hour because of the late arrival of the incoming flight. This delay caused us to make a dash to the connecting LHR flight in JAK. With 30 or so passengers making the connection, Garuda did the right thing by delaying the departure of Flight GA86 to LHR and escorting us through the airport to the gate. The A330 (MEL-JAK) had a 2-2-2 layout in an older style cabin, but it was comfortable. The B777-300 (JAK-LHR) had a 1-2-1 layout. It was a more modern cabin. Service was excellent with good quality food on both flights. Cabin crew tended to 'disappear' after clearing up the meal. IFE worked fine but the choices of movies was limited. Music choices were also lacking. Minor quibbles that won't affect my overall rating. A fine airline!",Promoter

From having to pay in advance to ensure my young children and elderly mother were sitting with me to the astronomical baggage fees. Our pilot was an hour late getting to our flight.

"  New York to Bangkok via Beijing with Air China. Going to Thailand they gave us Premium Economy which was fine. We didn't understand why so many people had complained about this airline. Coming back was a different story. The flight was delayed 4 hours and no one contacted us about the delay. We had to wait from 1am to 4 am at the airport. No answers. When we got to the ticket counter, we specifically asked the lady, even if we had to pay more, to allow us to travel in Premium economy and she said she had upgraded us for free, because of the delay, but we would be able to double check once we got to Beijing. When we got to Beijing, there was no one at the counter, and we waited. Finally, minutes before boarding we saw a person that we met on the way to Thailand, and he said they had changed the gate. We rushed to the new gate and they immediately put us on a bus and took us to the plane. Food, service and the cramped-up seats made for this one of the worst experiences ever.

"Just flew R/T from IAD-AMS-Dammam Saudi Aradia. I have not been on KLM international for years and based on European flights I had taken I was not expecting much. They had exceptional fares to Middle East so I tried them out. I was really very pleasantly surprised. Outstanding service on all 4 legs of the journey. Staff very attentive with the purser speaking to every business class passenger. Food about average for an international airline. Planes were A330's seats much like Qatar Airways I rarely lay flat but it looked like others were able to. Amsterdam is a very good transit airport and the KLM lounge is very good thought it does not have a great variety of foods (what it has is good). Best part of the lounge for me was the ""deep rest"" room with chaise lounges in carrells in a very dark room with just enough light to get around. My other European favourite airline is BA and I give KLM the edge with the more people-friendly airport. Too bad for me they're not in the OneWorld Alliance.",Promoter

February 27th flight UA 836 from Shanghai to Chicago was delayed 1.5 hours we got on the plane and were told that one of the radios was not working. After 2 hours the captain said that the flight was cancelled. I was sitting on the upper deck. When the flight crew were walking out of the flight deck they saw us all sitting and asked why were we still in our seats and did they not tell us that the flight was cancelled? We told them that no one made the announcement! Half an hour later the gate agent came in and told everyone in Chinese that the flight was cancelled they repeated in English that we should get off take our bags and proceed to door number 24 near Burger King where there would be a bus to take us to the hotel. They did not say which hotel or which bus. Everyone was confused which way to go. After much shouting by the mob of passengers they lead us to passport control. We went through but could not find out how to get out of immigration. Together with another passenger found gate number 24 but there were no people or buses. I found a United staff member who told us that the door had been changed to #23. We went out and there were 4 buses. No one knew what we were saying as they did not speak English. Luckily a Chinese woman came and we found the bus to learn that they were taking us to Sheraton 1 hour away. I decided to go to the Airport hotel which is in the terminal instead and pay out of pocket. They have arranged for the same plane to fly tomorrow at noon. This is an unscheduled flight. United really dropped the ball everyone was stranded with no direction or help.,Detractor
"  Manchester to Madrid. A lot of people rubbish Ryanair, but if you follow their requirements you should have a great flight. If you want to be sat next to someone pay for it. Check in as early as possible, use their app. If you want to board early buy the appropriate fare. Arrived 2.5 hours before departure at T3 Manchester to check bags. The Ryanair section was unbelievably busy considering it was 3.45am. However, the line of about 300 people was processed efficiently within 20 minutes.

I am a mere silver on United but decided to add some miles on a round-trip from JFK to LAX with a return through IAH to get a rare domestic ride on a flat BX seat in the internationally-configured 787. Completed the outbound yesterday in a 1 year old 737-900 with 20 ""first class"" seats. When the FA's started taking meal orders. The FA first goes to a young lady in the seat in front of me and informs her of the two menu choices. He then moves back to my row (4) and asks the woman next to me which she wants. He then looks at me and says he will be back. Then he works the other side of the aisle. He appears to be randomly moving between seats. Finally he gets to me and there is only one choice and he explained they have been instructed to service the FC cabin in order of United priority. In other word the 16 nonrevenue upgrades get their choice compared to the schmuck without a lot of status who used real money (and not a small amount).",Detractor
"TPE-SFO-TPE. Economy Plus. B-777 aircraft. United has become a very average airline. Economy""plus"" seats are really not much better than normal economy especially if you can get regular economy seats near exits or bulkheads. Food was mediocre. Flight attendants were considerably older than other airlines and seemed to be worn out as evidenced by their indifferent and even sarcastic attitudes. Compare them to All Nippon for example where the attendants are super friendly and bend over backwards for passengers. The return leg was late out of SFO by about 90 minutes. The one saving grace for this United flight was the price which was significantly lower than other TPE-SFO non stops. So I guess you get what you pay for. Recommended for price but if you can afford it any of the Asian airlines offer better service.",Passive
Unfortunately we were unable to use the online check-in service on the Lufthansa homepage. This service is apparently unavailable when you have a connecting flight in Los Angeles (LAX to FRA) and come from the Big Island of Hawaii - Kona Airport for that matter - meaning that our 4 tickets were scattered all over the plane. Luckily this problem could easily be solved by a friendly member of the Lufthansa ground staff in LA. The flight from LA to Frankfurt was okay overall seats on the 747-8I are not the most uncomfortable though a little too lightly padded. Dinner and Breakfast were offered - both were quite good.

" Norwegian used to be a great airline. When I saw favorable prices to my destination I jumped at the opportunity to fly with time. First of all, their lines are very long. It's been two hours since I got to the airport and all I've done is wait on line. As I was 10 minutes into waiting on the first line to check in, an employee demanded I wait on another line to get my carry on approved AWAY bag checked in. Ok, waited on that line to find out my bag was too large. Again, it meets their already ridiculous size requirements. I take out and wear as many clothes as I can so I can have my bag on me. I have a train to catch the hour after I land so I wasn't planning on spending any time waiting for my bag. The bag was still too big. I didn't want to waste any time. Then I wait on that line and am told a check in bag last minute is $100. I feel like my urgency and willingness to comply was exploited. I'm minutes away from boarding and waiting on the typical tsa check in line. Would have just checked in a bag from home if that were the case.",Detractor
"  Harare to Marrakech via Madrid. The flight from Harare to Addis was great. The shock came in Addis when flight ET712 to Madrid was overbooked. Upon checking in at Gate 9 (changed from Gate 1), the Ethiopian Airline officers stood three of us aside, apparently because our visa to Spain and Morocco had to be verified by a senior airline officer. Myself, a man from the Democratic Republic of Congo and a lady from Equatorial Guinea. During the check-in process, the man from the Congo protested fiercely, and was let in. As the queue died, we (me and the lady from Malabo) went to the boarding desk to get the EA senior to verify our VISA's to facilitate. The Ethiopian Airline officer handling the boarding looked aside and shouted, Boarding closed we will re-route you. The senior officer had not pitched up. No one had spoken to us. Nothing. I couldn't believe it that an airline would cook false stories to manage its own problem of overbooking. Fastforward to 02:00 Addis Time, 3 hours after the initial boarding time, we were still in their office and the lady from Malabo promised to get into another flight on Tuesday May 16th. I refused calmly and with smiles of spite. They tried to get me into ET702 to go to Morocco through Rome and i refused, returning their initial transit VISA lie that if i could not do a 60 minute transit to Morocco through Madrid, then i still could not take option of going through Rome, albeit 48 hours later. Later, another officer assisted by getting me proceed to Morocco by EgyptAir. His reason for my transfer ""flight overbooked"". And at this time I asked to see the Supervisor. The supervisor did not come. As this batch of officer's prepared to go home at 03h00, my AirEgypt flight to Cairo was also boarding. I left Addis without seeing the supervisor or getting the truth.

First time user of Ryanair so to be on the safe side booked seats and got priority boarding. We were very surprised at how smoothly everything went. Coming back from Palma it was obvious the people in front of us had used Ryanair before. They were a couple with two children and had put a large bag on the floor with coats on top and got the youngest child to lay on it. The father had another large bag over his shoulder. The Ryanair staff were walking down the line as we were waiting to board with a box the size of what suitcases were allowed a shand luggage but I never saw them check against anybody's luggage. Some of the so called hand luggage was almost as big as my hold suitcase.

My husband and I recently took a code share flight with Delta on Alitalia from Chicago to Rome. Flight #'s 629 ORD-FCO and 628 from FCO-ORD. Both flights were pretty much on time and boarding was a very organized way of doing things. The organization from Rome was a fiasco. There were not enough seats in the terminal at the gate causing everyone to crowd around the desk. It was impossible to see where we were to enter the process of boarding other than the blue carpet for the honorary fliers. This caused a huge crush when rows were called. It was chaos. The service on the plane was ok however the food was totally inedible. The snack on the return flight was tasteless. There were no air vents at the seats and the lighting on the sides of the airplane was out in many areas. The bathrooms were not in good repair and the TP ran out early although it was replenished at some point. The monitors were very far apart. If you weren't sitting in a seat close to one it was impossible to watch the programs.,Detractor

" Flew British Airways from Rotterdam to London City. Our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem, but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later, so that was not a big problem. Nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew, providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight. Inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point BA needs to improve. Also check in via BA-app didn't work both ways, so again there's room for improvement. Would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check-in times and short walkways at Rotterdam and London City. Price can be high though, especially when you have checked luggage, but we hadn't and I booked well in advance. Paid 200 euros rtn for two, which was fine. The advantage of London City is, apart from the distance to London, that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride.",Promoter

 Los Angeles to Rome. Placed a bid for upgrade to the premium cabin that was not accepted however when getting on plane seats in the premium cabin were available. When we mentioned that we had bid to upgrade and we were interested in upgrading to the premium cabin we were told that it would be $400 each. We explained our bid to the stewardess and were told to contact Norwegian and they would likely pay us back the difference. Unfortunately we (in two different rows) received the middle seat in the middle aisle. With the people in front of us reclining their chairs it was nearly impossible to get out our seats to go to the bathroom or to walk a bit on a 12 hour flight. Horrible seating arrangement in the center aisle for a premium seat. The woman seated next to me unfortunately spilled her entire glass of red wine on me early in the flight.

" This flight was a ""United by SkyWest"" Flight From Boise, Idaho to San Francisco and then to Fresno California. The gate operations and boarding went fine in Boise, and we departed on time. The problem started in San Francisco (SFO). When arriving in SFO, the pilot came on the intercom, alerting us to a computer problem ""Only effecting Skywest flights"" and that the plane couldn't, leave the gate since without the computer they couldn't do anything, but don't worry we would have it all cleared up in 20 minutes. 1 hour and 40 minutes later, they started to taxi around the tarmac in an effort to look like we were getting somewhere. At 2 hours we did finally get into the gate. We were told that most outbound flights were delayed so, Hurry and get to your gate and you can probably still get your connection. I rushed, I made it onto the plane. After about 20 minutes I noticed that we were not moving. Within a few minutes the flight crew arrives. The pilot announces that since they had been stuck on the Tarmac just like the rest of us, that they were about to ""Time Out:"" and that they were waiting for another flight crew to come aboard so that they could take over in Fresno. A few minutes later they announce that ""The Flight crew has arrived and they are waiting on the Jetway for paperwork."" Another hour passes, and still no flight crew. At exactly 2 hours after closing the plane they open it again, this time to announce that since they don't have seats for the new flight crew (There was 2 Deadhead crew already on the plane) that they would have to trade out the flight crew now. (Why it took them 2 hours to make this decision I don't know) At this time a New Voice comes over the intercom announcing that ""If You are going to get off Plane do so Now."" No explanation just a threatening voice, with no offer to re-book on another plane. Around 15 minutes later the captain (1st Crew) walks back into the cabin to explain what was going on and says that the new crew would be on the plane in a few minutes. Around 20 minutes later the new crew does arrive, and the Captain announces that as soon as they completed the inspection, and they had completed paper work we would be leaving, ""It should be about 20 minutes"". We all had a good laugh. I have never heard passengers catcall the pilot before. Well after another hour (The flight is now 4.5 hours late in departure) they push us back from the gate and start the plane. We eventually take off and arrive in Fresno 5 hours late.",Detractor

Flew from Melbourne to Singapore and back. Boeing 777-300 on MEL-SIN had one of the oldest IFE screens I have ever seen on SIA (flying since 2010). Priority meal for other passengers around me meant I had to wait for ages for a meal. SIN to MEL was a brand new A330-300 and had nice IFE and dinner served on board was the best I have had inflight. Serving dinner in the late night and keeping lights on meant there is no way you can sleep properly. I will still fly SIA because of their hospitality and cabin comfort.,Promoter
SUB-BKK then BKK-HKT-BKK and last KUL-SUB. The crew was impolite and unfriendly. When onboard from SUB to BKK and KUL to SUB I always found that my seat couldn't recline because the button had broken the seat pitch also unacceptable. When I was in the LCC terminal the ground crew were impolite and not responsive. This airline may be value for money but if you have heavy luggage this airline is not for you. AirAsia really disappointed me.,Detractor
"Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale with Spirit Airlines. This is the worst airline I have ever flown with by far. My husband and myself flew with Spirit as a connecting flight to our honeymoon. We flew out of Atlanta, and their employees are some of the rudest people I've ever encountered. My biggest issue was being assured that our bags were safely placed on our connecting flight with JetBlue, then later to be overseas and find out that they indeed were not. We were reassured day after day that they would be there tomorrow, but ironically never got them. We paid $200 on bag fees, for bags that never made it to our destination. Icing on the cake was after our trip, we made it back to the Ft Lauderdale airport that our bags were sitting at the airport all week. When I demanded an explanation, and my money back I was told that they had no athority to do so and that the night manager just forgot to load it on the plane. I have called, and called, and called so many times and no resolution. I tell everyone I know to never fly with Spirit.",Detractor
"  This flight from Copenhagen to London Heathrow was British Airways, but operated by Jet Time, who are operating some BA services on the LHR-CPH route this summer. The aircraft was definitely not up to BA standards - old, very worn inside. Cabin service I cannot comment on as fortunately I had 3 seats together so slept most of the flight. I really hope this is a temporary move on BA's part as this really is not the standard I have come to expect from them on this route.",Passive

We received another such email around 13:17 EST indicating that the flight was further delayed.

When our turn came the guy told us that he did only luggage drop off and invited us to line up again at the counter next to his. Quite a few people ahead of us. Then a few minutes later while we were still lining up we saw him checking people without any boarding passes. Then the person that checked us in was not any friendlier. This happened at the Jean Lesage Airport which was surprising because the people in Quebec were just the nicest people and because as Air Canada frequent users we never had to deal with such unpleasant people.,Detractor

We flew Spirit over the first week of March 2014 having picked it as an affordable way to get down to Miami from Montreal for a cruise. Our flights (both departing and returning) were delayed by at least an hour. The seats did not recline. I understand that this is a no frills airline but seriously? If you offer red-eye flights or flights at all at least giving your clients a comfortable place to sit/sleep should come free with the purchase of a plane ticket. Staff were very rude. Somehow each of our bags gained between 4 and 5 pounds between us weighing them at the door of the airport with our own scale at the scale sitting at the entrance to the quick bag check in line and the actual quick bag check in counter. Our carefully distributed bags ended up costing us an extra 25$. Needless to say we'll never be flying Spirit ever again.,Detractor
Had a horrible experience with Spirit for what was to be a 2-hour flight between Minneapolis and Denver. First off checking in the night before they reveal that it will cost $90 more to take baggage along carried on $80 checked in! Up to $60 more for a reserved seat. Plane was to leave at 3 pm no notice until arriving at the airport that it would leave at 4.30. Around 3.30 learned it might not leave at all or it might leave at 7.30 or 8 pm. We were told to wait because it might be fine then told plane was in the air and we'd leave at 8. Came back in plenty of time to find out the flight was cancelled! By then no opportunities to be rebooked on Spirit or any other airline until 24 hours later that was then extended to even later the next evening. No hotel vouchers unless you lived in another state. All passengers agreed they would never fly Spirit again. I've learned this sort of thing happens repeatedly with Spirit.,Detractor

I contacted Ryanair only to be told they were a non refund company and that my only option was to cancel the flight or sit in our seats. We had delays both sides, the cabin staff wouldn't take litter off anyone until the end of the flight. I know not all airlines provide complimentary food but I think Â£13 is ridiculous for a rubbish toasty and a water. It was 4.5 hour flight that was delayed you would think there would be something. Overall, myself and others we met at the airport have all said we won't be flying with Ryanair again.

"  Florence to Bristol. A positive first experience and I will try to fly BA in the future. When I booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds I was automatically allocated seats (no charge), 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest. A few hours before the flight, during online check-in, I noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket. I telephoned BA's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and I received a call back with an update part way through the process (no charge and no hassle). All staff from customer services to ground staff to in-flight crew were friendly. Staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child. We were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight. On this flight to Bristol everything is included in your ticket. We had soft drinks but a couple in-front had G&Ts. Our meal was salmon with couscous, bread, cheese and a mint. On the way back there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie. The meals were actually really nice. Both our flights did depart late for different and, what I believe were, unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to Italy still arrived early. Some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who hadn't got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up. I wasn't bothered which airline I flew with. My criteria were that I could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and BA came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight. My criteria will still exist but I will certainly be looking at BA first in the future.",Promoter

" Raleigh Durham to Seattle via Atlanta. My initial flight was from RDU to SEA on 01/08/18 early morning reaching SEA at 9:30am. Then Delta had a scheduled flight change and the arrival time in SEA got changed to 10:20am. I had an important meeting to attend at noon on 01/08 so I requested Delta to put me on a flight on 01/07 night instead which they did. My new flight was from RDU to SEA via ATL with a stopover of 45 minutes. The flight from RDU to ATL got delayed by 15 minutes. The RDU ATL flight arrived at gate B18 and the ATL SEA flight was from gate E6. Why would they even suggest such an itinerary with 45 minutes of stopover. I ran my heart out and reached gate E6 10 minutes before departure but the door had already closed. There were plenty of other passengers with me. Could they not have waited for 10 more minutes? Was it so difficult to see that there are other people connecting to this flight who had landed just 10 minutes before, more so given the fact that the flight was the last flight for the night to SEA from ATL? After that, I got rebooked on a flight to SEA via SLC reaching SEA at 12:30pm on 01/08. So basically the reason why I prepone my flight to 01/07 in order to reach on time for my meeting, you are now taking me to SEA even after my original direct flight from RDU to SEA. I told the gate agent about that and she was outright rude. I said I have to attend the meeting and I will take a non delta flight and reach SEA on time for my meeting. She told me that I wont get any refund since I am already rebooked on a different flight. So basically I ended up spending the whole night in ATL, waiting 4 hours in the terminal to get my bag out, and then ended up taking a 6:15am Alaska flight to SEA. I would never ever travel on Delta again. This was the worst experience I ever had and the gate agents and customer support is no good and outright rude.",Detractor

Stewardess promptly came over and in a very condescending tone berated me for using my phone.

Warm and friendly crew, aircraft in good condition and a choice of Rose or Brut champagne plus juices before take off. A pleasant hot breakfast was served and the crew remained visible and active throughout the flight. Washrooms were kept spotless and well stocked with amenities including Bulgari cologne.

"  Flew from Denver to Las Vegas. I bought my ticket on CheapTickets but later ended up paying for my seat and carry on, I ended up spending what I thought I had saved by buying the cheapest plane ticket. Spirit Airlines charges for every single thing before and during their flights. Of course Spirit offers you the option of many different discount programs which will possibly save you money in the long run but if you are flying just once a year as I do those discount programs will only make you spend more. The only free bag Spirit Airlines will allow you is small purse or backpack. I was only going on vacation for two days and obviously didn't have a lot of things with me and I ended up paying for my carry on. You will not see any TVs or any other entertainment onboard. Spirit also doesn't offer any courtesy drinks. I have to note that the flight attendants were great but that's the only good thing I can tell you about Sprint. If you are trying to save some money do not use Spirit. They also don't issue any refunds unless you cancel your flight seven days before your scheduled trip.

" AA got me to Europe and back to the US safely. That is about all I can say that's positive. I have flown this airline for over 30 years and they seem to be going downhill in on-time departures, comfort, and service. On my trip from DFW to Paris and the return from Rome, the service was the most apparently lacking. On the outbound they kept announcing another 30 minute delay(mechanical problem in the interior) every half hour for a total 3 hour delay. The ground crew was heard saying they did not have enough maintenance people working on a Sunday afternoon. The dinner service once onboard was rushed and unpleasant and I chalked it up to the late take off. Not so, because the service from the flight attendants on the return trip was just as shabby. FA were unfriendly, unhelpful, and at times rude or condescending towards passengers. They acted as if they did not want to be there doing this job. I was in the new Premium Economy cabin and paid a lot more than an economy fare for my ticket. I feel the higher cost should include better service, not just a bigger seat. The new Premium Economy passengers had to go sometimes to the very back of the plane and through the galley to use a vacant lavatory. Forget stretching your legs on a long flight by walking to the back as the aisles are so narrow in the Main Cabin one can not avoid bumping seated passengers.There was no offer of refills on the free alcohol drinks. Any question or request was met with an attitude that the FA could not be bothered. I could see that this job may not be the most glamorous, but if you can't or won't do the job, then retire so that someone with a better attitude could take your place. Or maybe you should take a desk job at American.",Passive
I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight. I would certainly endorse Alaska Airlines.,Promoter
AKL-Nadi. Business Premier. Smart 777-300 felt roomy and the interior modern. It was a short 3 hour flight through to Nadi which I was looking forward too after 2 weeks in NZ. The Lounge was Ok and well serviced but very busy. The Qantas Lounge is a letter better and comfortable. Boarding was smooth and the crew welcomed us by name which is a great touch. Service was professional friendly and somewhat quick to the point of being a little hurried. The NZ wines and meal was excellent. The seat is great especially when I managed to get a 60 min nap in prior to landing. You can't beat the privacy but it comes at a cost of being social when traveling with a partner. I am not sure if this would be my first choice from LAX-AKL as a re-branded south pacific airline was better in the all round. Air NZ is still a great airline product though!,Promoter
"  I flew from Vancouver to Tokyo Haneda in Economy Class on June 4, 2017 for my summer vacation. This is my first time visiting Japan and my first time flying with ANA. The seat while being somewhat narrow had ample legroom. There is plenty of open space under each seat which allows you to either place a bag or stretch out if you are tall. The in-flight entertainment was also very up to date, and seeing the movie ""Your Name"" on the in-flight entertainment list was a good surprise. Other good parts of the plane itself are the blue lighting, automated shades, and the washrooms which were clean and not cramped. The use of mirrors inside the washroom really help to alleviate the cramped feeling. Food was well presented for Economy and definitely a step up from what you would expect from a typical North American airline. The selection of free snacks and drinks are much appreciated. Finally, the service was polite, friendly, and responsive. The only thing I can fault ANA for is that the in-flight wifi service was very slow. I paid $21.95 USD and it was barely able to load Instagram or even low-quality YouTube videos. I really hope to see free wifi or at least faster performance for paid wifi in the future. But overall, you really can get by without it. I just wanted it for peace of mind during my flight. I'm flying with ANA back to Vancouver and will definitely recommend the airline to my friends.",Promoter

"My spouse booked this flight six weeks prior to departure. She has platinum status on Delta, but was unable to obtain an economy comfort upgrade. She was also unable to purchase economy comfort seats (none available), so we ended up in economy. As with the flight from SLC to CDG, the seats in the return CDG to SEA flight were the worst I've experienced - cramped, inadequate padding, solid armrests, and hardly any recline. This was a day flight - I didn't sleep well the night before, and was unable to take a nap. Seat discomfort made my flight experience miserable. My spouse and I forgot to bring our seat backs to the upright position before landing at SEA, and the FAs didn't notice. That's how minimal the recline is. Once again, food quality had deteriorated from my last transatlantic Delta flight in January 2014. I forgot to buy take on food at CDG. Delta offered a wide selection of movies, but the free headset's poor sound quality made it impossible to enjoy them. My 1-star rating for entertainment is based on the headset's poor sound quality.

The flight to Madrid a short travel of 45/50 minutes arrived on scheduled to Madrid so I had a stopover there of about 4 hours. I didn't have problems with the luggage. The boarding was a bit confusing (due to speedy boarding) and the flight was full so the experience on the ground and on board was poor. The space between the seats was also very short a thing that is normal on these low cost companies. My returning flight was threatened by a ground strike on Barajas.

Never been on Southwest before and I was sure they were not going to match AA. Paid for Early Boarding and received low A group boarding on both flights. Their airport kiosks for bag drop is very user friendly and both flights were the fastest check in I've experienced. I don't mind paying baggage fees when I have to but the 2 bags free policy was a nice change. Boarding was organized and everyone paid close attention as where to stand in line. The planes are very clean and the seats for coach are great. Standard legroom and the open seating was fine for this trip. Very fast boarding they may be on to something here. Fast on board service without carts in the aisle. Overall a very nice trip and would easily use Southwest again for certain trips out of Austin. They do serve a niche.,Promoter
We flew First Class AKL-CDG return firstly on the Dreamliner and then Airbus A330-200. Exceptional service from the moment we entered the plane. Food was perfectly adequate as was the class of champagne. The crew couldn't have done more for us. Entertainment was a bit of a let down not a great selection. We were 2 of only 3 people in first class so it was very conducive to sleeping. On arrival in Guangzhou we were met at the gate by a CZ employee who escorted us through Customs and then to The Pullman hotel for our 16 hour stopover. We were given a breakfast voucher for use during our stopover however having just had breakfast on the plane a lunch voucher would have been more beneficial. Hotel was lovely large room quiet and cool. Next leg to CDG Paris was just as good excellent service and only the 2 of us in First Class. Return journey back to AKL a month later was just as good. Southern China is excellent value for money and I'm not kidding myself that it is on a par with Emirates for instance but it allowed us to sleep well and arrive at our destinations in pretty good shape.,Promoter
"  Guangzhou to Melbourne. I was arranged to wait in VIP lounge during the delays with updates of my flight details. After the boarding notice was out, a coach was sent to take us to the plane. I would say it was a most pleasant flight relative to my flights with other airlines. The flight attendants was polite and friendly. Despite it was a delayed and night flight, they welcomed me with smile and warm greeting. There was a variety of food and beverages to choose from the menu for business class. The food ranged from chinese to western styles so that everybody are able to choose according to their preferences. The presentation of food was tempting and the taste was good. For drinks, they provide many choices. The selections of inflight entertainment was fine. I was able to connect to WIFI, the best time killer among all. Lastly, the environment of cabin and washroom was clean. They cleaned the washroom very often, and for me cleanliness is always the most important criteria.",Promoter
" Amsterdam to Kiev. Never had such a bad travel experience. Our family was suppose to fly to Kiev from Amsterdam. The flight was delayed for 3 hours and finally when we arrived to destination we discovered that our luggage was not loaded. And not just our family, but probably 100 other families. When we tried to find out what happened nobody bothered to explain. We were told to fill out claim forms, go home and wait. Today is a second day of our vacation. We do not have anything, even a tooth brush. And again nobody at the airport bothered to at least explain what happened initially, when should we expect to get a luggage. I have never seen anything like that. Not one person cares. Not one person tries to help. Who is responsible for such a mess?",Detractor
" Athens to Bratislava. The flight was more than an hour delayed, and no one gave an information, only just before the departure. We arrived at 20:20, although the flight arrival should have been 19:15. My final destination was Vienna, so i have booked an inclusive plus airport line ticket from the Ryanair site. We departed at 21:20 with the bus, the driver could not speak English, he accused me of a heavy luggage and asked for money (although it was not asked from me to put it inside the bus), and it is now 22:24, I am still sitting in the bus because the driver stopped for coffee in a gas station, letting us wait in the bus for more than 15 minutes!

"Germanwings from Bangkok to London via Cologne. Imagine to fly with Ryanair for a 12hours long fly, without any food or beverage included in your ticket. The price wasn't cheap at all to justify such a lack of service. If you would like to eat something make sure you carrying euro (only currency accepted) or credit cards to buy food they are offering. The seats feel small. One of the cabin staff was very kind but other cabin crew service was not as bright. If you fly with Germanwings, make sure you pay very little money and or fly on shorter flights. The short connecting flight from Cologne to London was good though.",Detractor
"  Shanghai to Guangzhou. We often receive message from China Southern for festival wishes and gifts as well as ticket preferential information, which I like very much. This time from Shanghai to Guangzhou I specially selected Boeing 777-300 for my trip. The business class configuration is private. Although the ground staff told us there were full passengers in the business class that we five people couldn't sit together, we enjoyed the latest business class seat. I prefer to the characteristic meal for deluxe beef noodle but this time without such meal to provide flight attendants were passionate to recommend other meals to me.",Promoter
"London to New York JFK, returning from Miami, and great flights with in Business Class on Boeing 777-300. The space, comfort, and privacy on this aircraft is second to none. The cabin crew were courteous and helpful (most of my flights with AA have been in coach where the rudeness of the staff used to be legendary). On both flights, the FA greeted by name, confirmed my meal order with me (requested on line) and took my coat. Outbound lunch was good, as were the wines. Drinks constantly replenished. A selection of snacks was laid out in the bar between meals, although I didn't try them. The pre-landing snack was croque monsieur, which was ok but really no better than the pizza that you used to get in coach many years ago. Before landing, the purser walked through the cabin thanking each passenger for flying AA. A nice touch. Bose noise cancelling headphones are superb, although they collect them almost an hour before landing. On the return from MIA, the food and service were again very good. The steak on flights starting the in the US is always better than on those starting in the UK, and it was served on a very hot plate. The salad was excellent. FA asked if I wanted to be woken for breakfast. Although I didn't I was awake when breakfast came round and it was surprisingly good. I'd previously flown Business Class on the US Airways A330. The 777-300 seat is similar but improved. There is no gap between the seat and the wall, where things can be lost on the A330. There is a vanity mirror in the storage cupboard. The TV screens are larger (15â€). The seats have more adjustable positions. However, there is no storage under the footrest. A nice lightweight duvet and large fluffy pillow added to the comfort. The seats are a bit hard when sitting fully upright or fully flat for any length of time, but are very comfortable when reclined. Sleeping on the way back, the plane was very warm and I slept on top of the duvet which was very comfortable indeed. The washrooms on this plane are very nice, particularly the one on the starboard size which is double sized. The equipment makes this Boeing 777-300 the best business class across the Atlantic, and the service was up to par. The downside of this plane is that all the seats are very private, and if you are travelling with a companion then even in the middle pair you can't really see or talk to each other. If you want to socialise with a travelling companion, you may not like this plane. IFE was fair, not a lot of new films but enough newish and classics to keep me happy. I've marked down ground service because of a problem at LHR. I am gay and was travelling with my partner. The check in operative at tried to make us check in separately. When I asked if married couples had to check in separately she said no. I explained that my travelling companion was my Civil Partner, and that we had the same legal rights as a married couple. She was embarrassed and apologetic, but making assumptions about peoples sexuality is inappropriate. Business class check in and fast track security at LHR are excellent.",Promoter

LHR-CDG-HAV and HAV-CDG-LHR. Going was a pretty new 777-300. Main meal was good however usual terrible Air France breakfast of some hard bread and tea/coffee. Seats were OK nothing special. Stop in CDG was poor as usual not the airline's fault though. CDG is the worst designed overpriced airport I have ever been to. Coming back slightly older 777 with no USB port which was annoying. Very uncomfortable seats couldn't really get into any sleeping position. Service is almost non existent apart from meal times and one or two drinks rounds. You have to get yourself to the back of the plane and help yourself to drinks and ice cream but they don't tell you this so if you don't know then no drinks for you!,Passive
"The lack of Spirit Airlines customer service is astounding. After booking a flight for my wife and myself and paying $780, a family incident required that we needed to cancel our reservations. Even though the cancellation was a week before the scheduled flight Spirit paid themselves $300 for their inconvenience. Unknown to me at the time the remaining credit of $480 had a 60 day expiration. 68 days later when I went to rebook a flight I discovered that the ""credit"" had expired. Spirit Airlines scooped up the balance. When I called their ""customer did-service"" their response was ""so sorry we can't do anything"". Spirit customer service is non-existent.

YVR-LHR on the high density 777. Will avoid this aircraft in the future. Seats were filthy when we got on the plane with garbage shoved under the seat and in the pockets. Not acceptable for business class. Service was poor and staff constantly running around frantically. No water runs no one came to collect garbage and there was no snack bar unlike other 777 flights. Food was mediocre at best. One positive about the 777HD is that the IFE is excellent and the TV screen is much larger. If you are seated next to someone consider yourself stuck because it is very difficult to climb over when the seat is reclined.,Passive
Flew to Tampa from Gatwick on the 12/5/15 return flight on the 25/5/15. Had flown with BA on several occasions to Mauritius. Can't believe despite the number of complaints BA received nothing has changed regarding the food the service. Admittedly some of crew are good but some of them makes you wonder why did they choose such career. BA seriously need to review the customer care they provide. Dinner overcooked frozen rolls with a cereal bar for breakfast - really tasted better food on cheaper airline. Come on BA listen to your customer and improve your service. Very disappointed with BA.,Detractor
" Houston to Newark. Worst Customer Service Experience. We booked and paid for 2 large seats 8 months in advance only to show up to the airport and be told that our seats were double booked and sold to someone else. Then be told by the agent that the person who our seats were sold to had not only not checked in for the flight yet but that he had not yet paid for the seats because his credit card was declined (too much of his private information to share with me). Then they brought the Supervisor over who didn't even come speak to us and appeared to have NO clue what she was doing (in way over her head). She just whispered to the agent to tell us that there was nothing they could do we were basically screwed. So to Be clear: When I checked in for my flight I was told by the agent that the seats I booked and paid for 8 months in advance, were given to someone else who had not yet paid for the seats or checked in. How in the world does that make any sense? Not Only were my seats booked and paid for 8 months in advance, I was there, checked in and seats were paid for all while the other person wasn't there, wasn't checked in and hadn't paid for the seats but the seats still went to them? It was the return flight of a round trip! Who doesn't show back up for their return flight? Especially on upgraded tickets booked 8 months in advance! How could these idiots resell our upgraded seats on a return flight of a round trip booked 8 months in advance? I cannot believe this is at all possible! Then when we get to the gate, they announce the flight was oversold by 7 seats! So 7 people missed their flight home. Just an awful airline. I'll never fly Spirit Airlines again and will share this terrible experience with all of my friends, family, employees, customers and all colleagues to ensure that everybody I know and they know will never fly on this incompetent airline. Spend a few extra bucks and fly a better airline, don't make the same mistake I did!",Detractor

"I was flying from LAX to Vegas on a Thursday with my friend. This was my first time flying Spirit and I was surprised at how cheap the tickets were. Warning sign #1. I own your typical small black roller carry-on bag that I've had for the past 6 years. It is not bulky or large in any way and I've carried-on with all other airlines without trouble. After jamming it into the clearly too-small ""Spirit carry-on size required container"" the Spirit attendant told me I would have to check-it. This bag was nowhere near full (it was a 2-day trip) but was a tight fit into their container with about 1 inch showing above the top bar. She then attempted to charge me $75 to check my bag! The round-trip ticket itself wasn't even that much! I began discussing with the attendant my options and instead of helping she was quite rude and adamant about charging the fee and repeatedly asked me how I would like to pay the $75 (cash or card). This was beyond reasonable in my mind. I was basically stuck paying more than my ticket value to check a standard carry-on that had worked for years on every other airline. Other issues: Flight was late arriving and late to take-off seats were extremely uncomfortable and rigid no service provided on-board without a fee of some kind.

"Sydney to Johannesburg with Qantas in Premium Economy. Boarding was quick and efficient with sparkling wine or fruit juice offered prior to take off. The Senior Cabin Attendant came round to introduce herself and advised who would be providing service during the flight. This is the first time we have experienced this personal touch, and throughout the flight the service was excellent, including the cabin attendant coming round to say goodbye and wish well on arrival. The premium economy seat is very comfortable and has plenty of space, although the leg / footrest could be improved. This was a 14 hour daylight flight. Bar service after takeoff included an excellent choice of wines. Food was very good. Slow roasted lamb shank - newly introduced Neil Perry meal featured in Qantas magazine - was superb. Second full meal, also very good, was served about 6 hours later. A snack was then offered about an hour before arrival. Throughout the flight the crew were available, and came round on a regular basis. The entertainment on offer is extensive, and whilst nothing appealed in the wide choice of films, none of which seemed very recent releases, there was an extensive range of CDs from which a playlist could be compiled, and enjoyed through good noise reducing earphones.

SIN-AKL 28th March. Very nice smooth flight. A printed menu good food a great entertainment system. The 777 is not the most spacious aircraft but never mind at least Singapore Airlines have the brains to stick to a 3x3x3 seating arrangement and do not push it to 3x4x3 like some others such as Air New Zealand do. (In my opinion there should be some international law that forbids this practice because the cramped isle compromises safety.) The service and entertainment made up for the lack of space so I would still rate it as a 5 star experience.,Promoter

During the flight, we were quickly offered snacks and a drink. The attendant came around selling ear buds for $5 to use with the TV at each seat. Having your own TV made the flight enjoyable.

"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively.

The aircraft was dirty the employees were unhelpful and the landings weren't that good. Low fare = low service and low quality at Spirit.,Detractor
"  Orlando to Newark. I booked with JetBlue because I thought it would make my flying experience so much smoother. But on multiple occasions they have made it an absolute nightmare. Upon flying to Costa Rica, my flight was scheduled to depart at 8 AM. They delayed it an hour at a time over seven times and then they completely cancelled the flight at 2PM. There were no other flights from JetBlue until the next day, meaning most of us lost money on hotels, shuttles, and time wasted. They did not give me a credit for the time lost, they just partially refunded me for the ticket since I was also coming back from Costa Rica flying JetBlue. I am now in Orlando, trying to get back home to New Jersey, and the same nightmare is happening again. They delayed it by an hour and a half. Now they've delayed it by another 45 minutes.

"Very good flight in Club World from start to finish. OK, so the plane may be rather old, but it was in immaculate condition and the cabin crew (older, mostly British) delivered efficient professional and friendly service. The lie flat bed (I took a rear facing window seat) is excellent for sleeping and gives great privacy. The food offering was not amazing (some cost cutting here) and I was surprised to see nuts served in bags not on dishes. There was however a good selection of drinks and glasses were topped up as required. Inflight entertainment was excellent, with a great range of both movies and TV shows.

"I booked 2 tickets from New York JFK to Rome return for two trips in 2015, travelling in Alitalia's Premium economy product. They cordon off Premium economy seating area which is limited to 24 seats or less. Offerings include a free amenity kit which depending on the time of year can be from a famous Italian designer. Priority boarding and deplaning is offered, meals of a taste good are included. We were fed four times and offered free drinks. As someone who is disabled the Flight attendants insisted I use the business class bathrooms as they did not want me to walk very far. As a disabled person I felt that they went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Check in was a breeze, as you use the line for business class. I believe this product is perfect in price if you want to feel like your flying in premium but not spend a ton of cash for it.

The interior quality of the planes were poor 2/3 times and the seats in economy class do not easily accommodate someone taller than 5'10"" (too tight for the knees). The staff and crew seem unapproachable and disinterested. It is also irritating that if you book online you then have to be pulled aside at check-in so they can verify your card. I understand the concept but the fact that they force you to step out of line and then wait in line again after they finish is really frustrating.

But its a bit shame that I didn't get to use the bath tub facility in there, as it was too busy, and the bath staff were not particularly sorry for not being able to offer me this service. Went to the gate soon after having some food in the lounge. The first class cabin was small, however as you will sit in your own suite, it didnt feel small at all when settlted in. The crew was not as pleasant as the inbound crew. The food was a let down. Again the drink was nice and due to my experience on the outbound, I retracted the lumbar massage tool, and the seat became a fully flat bed and was wide on the shoulder area, so I could put my arms on the side. I asked for an extra duvet from the crew for comfort, but the due to the cabin was fully booked, the crew gave me a biz class blanket, which was less desirable. Had a solid 7 hour sleep onboard and that was my longest sleep on an aircraft, so missed all snacks etc. Overall happy flight, and a good rest is more than food and drinks to me.",Passive

"Flew KLM WBC (the new flat bed) from LAX to AMS seat 1A. Really appreciated the flight, very comfortable seat/bed with a lot of privacy. Slept for 6 hours. Cabin staff were very friendly and forthcoming, would assign a score of 9/10 for the overall flight/airline experience. However it got to a definite 10/10 the next day. I forgot a personal item in my seat. Got contacted by email by their lost and found service at AMS while waiting for my connecting flight in the KLM Crown lounge the next day. They asked me if I was missing something as they had found an item in my seat in that flight. When confirming this by email and having described the item, I received a phonecall and the lost item was personally delivered at the lounge. This is great customer service.",Promoter
LHR-NRT-LHR. We were travelling with a baby and ground and cabin staff were accomodating and caring. Great thing about ANA is that your buggy is put in a large plastic bag and taken to the hold at the door. It is brought up at the door at the other end so no lugging a heavy baby plus handluggage through the airport. Sitting at bulkhead with bassinet plenty of leg room. Entertainment on demand and a wide selection of international movies. Cabin crew warm and friendly. Baby meal and child's meal served first. Child's meal nutritous and excellent. Our food was delicious from NRT okay from LHR but odd breakfast of piece of ham and cheese (I pinched some of my daughter's more substantial child's meal). Service method is strange to say the least and rather slow - 3 hours to complete and no one wants to sit with a dirty tray in front of them for an hour waiting for tea. Also switch lights on about 4 hours before landing which is excessive for those that want to rest more. Eyemasks and earplugs are provided on demand as are toothbrushes and paste but this is not really advertised. Interior of the aircraft spotless and toilets remained so throughout entire flight.,Promoter
"Never use Air China! The start of our long trip from Helsinki to Sydney via Stockholm and Beijing began with a flight to Stockholm with SAS, very quick and efficient and staff were nice and friendly. That's when our trip went sour. Boarding the Air China flight was chaotic and when we did board the staff were miserable and didn't greet us. This service continued throughout the flight. Once it was time for our meals, the options are either rice with pork or beef or rice with chicken - no good if your either a vegetarian or vegan. After food is served they came to collect the trays and pretty much snatched them from us, no please or thank you's either. Same experience on our connecting flight to Sydney. The flight attendants English is appalling, and you could barely hear their announcements. Seating is awful, but I guess that's why the flights were so cheap. The only positive from this experience was upon checking in at Sydney for our flights back home, we were allocated seats towards the front of the plane with bigger legroom for our flight from Beijing to Stockholm. Apart from that I strongly recommend that you avoid Air China.",Detractor
"During my trip London to Tbilisi via Istanbul last week, we landed only 25 minutes before my boarding time and even though I tried to search for some help, neither cabin crew nor ground staff bothered to tell me anything. The final drop was when I saw my ruined suitcase.

I flew from London (LGW) to Jakarta (CGK) in Seat 6A and really enjoyed my flight. It was via Amsterdam and delays were involved but overall we weren't that late arriving here in Jakarta around midday. The aircraft was clean and all crew were professional and friendly and the meals were exceptionally good. I have an issue with Garuda in that seem unable to sell me a ticket for this flight but originating in Cardiff (CWL) so I could join the long haul sector in Amsterdam. It seems ridiculous that two SkyTeam members can't co-operate better. Even KLM Gold Elite Plus members are denied lounge access in Jakarta but not elsewhere in Indonesia on Garuda economy domestic flights.,Promoter

While sitting here waiting for the plane to be fixed, I hear agents announcing that this flight or that flight is overbooked! This seems to be the norm with United.

"  When flying to the States I go via Dublin wherever I can as the Security clearance in Dublin is a bit of a no brainer and after months of deciding how to get there this time decided to try United Polaris, it was around Â£400 cheaper than the alternatives. Security was quick using the Fast Track, and we were soon in the new Fifty First and Green lounge where there was an array of breakfast pastries to enjoy before boarding. We'd chosen row 8 and boarding was painless and we were soon enjoying a pre take off Mimosa, having stowed the Saks of Fifth Avenue bedding. Menus were handed out and crew came and took orders for mains before take off. The seat was spacious and comfortable. This was a brunch flight and crew came out with a trolley to make signature Bloody Marys and Mimosas which were served with warm nuts. Meal service with a delicious smoked salmon starter was followed by a succulent steak with scrambled eggs and potatoes. After the cheese plate a United sundae was served, drinks were regularly topped up by crew who were absolutely outstanding, and friendly. Great inflight entertainment and a nice range of snacks were available and about an hour before landing lunch was served which was roast chicken with cous cous and veg. Flight landed on time at 1110 and thats where the benefit of Dublin security kicked in - we were out of the airport with checked luggage and in our taxi at 1130.

"  This latest British Airways trip from London Heathrow to Dallas Fort Worth just confirms how standards are slipping. Background: family living in USA = regular leisure transatlantic flyer, in the last 10 years consistently booking for 2-3 travellers on each trip, regularly flying Business for eastbound transatlantic leg. To date transatlantic travel (over 30 years) has been exclusively with British Airways. Service has been almost consistently good or very good. We may not be Gold or Silver members, but we don't deserve the shoddy treatment this most recent booking received. 1) Original booking for outbound LHR-DFW leg was booked by BA agent over the phone in the wrong category/class, even though it was made clear we wished to purchase an upgrade (cash or airmiles) at a later date. Subsequent phone calls over the next few months were a farce, with consistently inconsistent responses - when we eventually managed to get through. The Executive Club customer service link just sends you round in circles! A formal emailed complaint through ""Contact us"" resulted in ""we're sorry to hear you've had problems"" - but no solution offered. Teeth gritted and traveled. 2) 9.5 hour flight LHR-DFW departing 1030. Refreshments/drinks served 1130ish before lunch. 9year old daughter hungry, no nibbles. When asked, steward responded ""well, that's cutbacks for you"". Pre-ordered child's meal arrived 1230, before standard adult meals. No problem. Juice and water were available during the afternoon. No snacks available for children for 5 hours! ""Cutbacks"". Luckily I had a packet of shortbread (as a gift for friends in USA). At 1830 cabin service (tea) started. When I asked for daughter's pre-ordered child's meal, conversation with stewardess went thus - ""Why didn't you order one?"" ""I did!"" ""She didn't have a child's meal at lunch"" ""Yes, she did!"" ""Oh well, I'll check when I've finished serving the main cabin"" Really? We were only in the 3rd or 4th row - would it have been too much effort to check then? Clearly yes it would. And when she did check some 20 minutes later, there was no child's meal - so they cobbled together a few bits from an unused child's lunch, very ungraciously. No hint of an apology. Customer service? Customer satisfaction? Result: continued loyalty for transatlantic flights? What do you think?",Detractor
" Paris CDG to Taipei TPE via Shanghai PVG, 18h journey including a 5h layover. Was a bit worried about flying them when I saw how cheap they were compared to other airlines, and because both their website and app make no sense in both French and English. It looks like the Chinese version went through a translating software and left that way. Playing around clicking on everything through their app made me realise I was admissible to free VIP lounge access due to the length of my layover, that was not long enough to be allowed out of the airport (EU citizens can request free 48h visa for any international transfer in any major Chinese city, HongKong/Macao/Taiwan included, but the customs decide if they will let you out or not by judging how long your layover is). Online check in on the app crashed, and made me wait a bit longer at CDG for manual check in. And my flight wasn't eligible to online check in anyway because there is no baggage drop counter for Air China at CDG. Went through a messy process but always on time. They did check the weight of my hand luggage. On my way inbound clerk was new and asked me if I was ok getting my luggage back in Shanghai and re-checking it in. I said no, she went for help and managed to check my luggage for transfer. Was a bit longer than usual but it saved me the hassle. Boarding was only 20 minutes before departure but it didn't make them late. Layover in Shanghai was a long process through customs and health check. Then despite being economy I had free access to VIP lounge with free food, drinks and bathrooms with showers. Food buffet was like a good hotel breakfast buffet. Everything was comfy but WiFi was pretty bad though. The snack on my short flight from Shanghai to Taipei was just not edible though. I still don't know if it was supposed to be cold noodles or celery because it was tasteless and texture was like plastic. It was a snack and I wasn't hungry thanks to the lounge buffet so whatever. Boarding and unboarding in Shanghai was always by bus, so boarding time was 1h before take off. Aircraft was old 330-200, had crumbs everywhere and the old carpeting smell. Seats were clean but definitely old (especially when deploying my tray). Seat and legroom felt a bit cozy but it didn't feel tighter than other companies. IFE's touchscreen was dead on both ways and I had to use the buttons on the armrest to use it, and it was laggy but usable. I pre ordered a fat free meal, got steamed fish and pasta with veggies and plain tomato sauce and mushroom omelette outbound, fried tofu noodles and carrot puree with veggies on my way inbound. Looked way better than the other regular meals (greasy noodles and porridge). No snacks. Drinks were served 4 times, no black tea, only green tea, and would often come to suggest drinking water. Staff were not smiling but they were efficient and not being rude, I was fine with that. They also prevented two passengers from fighting. In the end it wasn't my best flight experience, but it was far from being a nightmare. And to be able to travel to the other side of the globe for the price I paid with lounge access, I definitely recommend it.",Passive
"My trip turned out to be enjoyable and no surprises if you plan ahead and follow the baggage weight and size policy to the letter. We flew as a family of 4 from New York to Fort Lauderdale on an airbus A321. Both flights arrived on time and baggage came out within 20 minutes of arriving. The seats were comfortable enough for a 3 hour flight and I am 6 ft tall. The airport terminals for cheap airlines are dingy and overcrowded. Your fare does not include ""seats"". There are cheap seats range from $10 to $40 each way so make sure you book your $10 seats online as early as possible or your trip cost just went up $80 per person. The best deal is the free personal bag (backpack) - you can stuff quite a bit in 16x14x12. Our checked baggage was overweight and the FLL agent was nice and gave us tips to put the heavy items in our backpack to avoid paying the $50 overweight fee! Our flight out was 30 minutes late departure (but still landed on time) and the agents on board were friendly and rolled off a few good jokes to win the crowd over. Fill up you water bottles at the terminal to avoid buying drinks onboard and bring some chips. Our bikes cost $75 which is much cheaper than the major carriers.

WiFi was unavailable during the whole flight. Flight map was also shut down until late. A flight attendant explained that this is because flight map was not allowed to see in US air space. What an unbelievable explanation I've ever heard about! Meals were really bad and no fresh fruits were provided. During the 14-hour flight, no snacks other than peanuts were available. Cabin service was nearly zero aside from meal and drink serving, and it seemed that some of the cabin crews were not willing enough to help the passengers. The planed arrived PVG 35 min ahead of schedule, but it was hold on the tarmac for nearly 45 min until we reached the gate. The second leg to Guangzhou was also all about waiting.

"  I was supposed to be on flight 283 Orlando to St. Louis and the flight was cancled. I had the worst customer service I have ever had In my life. I never received a cancled flight notification until 30 min before my flight was supposed to leave. Thank God I was there 3 hours early, and the airport staff was going up and down the line asking if people were flying to st Louis. One of the staff members pulled me out of line and told me to go into a delayed or cancled flight line. I had been in that line for over an hour, and that line was just to check my bag. I than waited in line to see if my flight had been delayed or cancled (At this time I didnt know which) an additional hour to be told yes my flight was cancled and that there were no other flights going out until Thursday. I asked if there was anyway they could help me find a new flight to St. Louis anywhere and they told me no they couldn't help me because they had no access to any other airline because of the way Frontier Airlines system worked. I told them I didn't have enough money to stay in a hotel and asked them if they would be able to give me a voucher to put me in a hotel until Thursday. They again told me no and that Frontier Airlines doesn't do those things when flights are cancled because of weather. They told me all they could do for me was give me a refund on my flight. I than found out my refund would not be put back into my account for 10 days. So I had no additional money to find another flight with a different airline. I told them that I had found another flight to st Louis going out to a different airport that was 2 hours away and that I could afford the flight but not the taxi to get to the airport, and asked if they could give me a voucher for the taxi. They told me sorry we can't do that either because of how the flight was cancled. The people at the desk told me that they were sorry for the inconvenience, but there was nothing they could do to help me get home in any way. They than gave me a number to call to voice my complaint and the number was out of service. So, stranded in Orlando with only 100 dollars to my name and absolutely no help from Frontier Airlines I had to than call and ask my parents to find me a way home. They were able to get me on a flight with American Airlines that was over 400 dollars. So 14 hours later and 2 flights, I was able to make it home without any help from Frontier Airlines. I have never been treated so poorly, and have never seen an airline that genuinely didn't care about their passengers as much as Frontier Airlines. I have received nothing. Not my money back, or an explanation to why things happened the way they did, or even an apology.

" I recently flew Air China economy class from Los Angeles to Tokyo via Beijing. The LAX-PEK leg was on a Boeing 777-300. The flight departed LAX around 12:40am on time. I had an aisle seat. The seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom and were slightly wider than other airlines. The seat back entertainment had limited number of movies and TV shows, but I was more interested in sleeping than watching a movie. The flight crew did a reasonable job serving the after departure meal and breakfast. The meals were edible, nothing special. One complaint I have is they could have been through the cabin more often with water and juices during the flight. I gave myself several hours for transit through Beijing. This was reasonably fast and I had no problems. On the Tokyo leg the flight was on an A321. The interior of this plane was a bit tatty. The seats were comfortable, but a little thread bear, but tolerable for a short 2 hour 40 minute flight. Again on this flight the flight crew could have been through with water or juice more often. After seeing previous reviews I was expecting the worst, but was pleasantly surprised.",Passive
Pekanbaru to Bandung and vice versa. During the flight there was nothing too special. Special services for passengers with red carpet service in Pekanbaru - nothing. Should correspond to their advertising - red carpet passenger will be allowed to board the plane first but red carpet passengers in Pekanbaru were mixed with ordinary passengers during boarding. In fact there were regular passengers before me on my first flight.,Passive
"Zurich to Sydney via Doha. Overall an okay experience. but with the new excess baggage rates probably the last time I've flown with them.

"A very frustrating experience. First their flight is delayed due to ""bad weather"" in LGA whereas we can see that United and all other airlines are taking off and the weather looked good enough. Initially they said it is delayed by an hour so we thought fine lets wait for an hour then they tell its delayed by another 2 hours. We had to catch a connecting flight at ORD which had just an hour layover. Then finally this flight from LGA is scheduled to take off 6 hours later than actual scheduled timings which means the connecting flight has already left. I called the customer care to check for the status and they tell that there are no more connecting flights from ORD to XNA for the day. The next connecting flight was only at 9.15am from ORD. So we decided to wait until 6.30am that day and leave directly from LGA instead of going to ORD and waiting till 9.15am. We (including my aged mother) finally landed up sleeping in the airport all night. The TSA officials were kind enough to give all passengers sleeping in the airport a cot and a bed sheet. Next day morning we start at 6.15AM and then again the flight is delayed by 2 hrs. One of the passengers asked the flight attendant if she will get her connecting flight and the attendant replies ""We just have to keep hopes. That is all we can do""!",Detractor
Istanbul (Ataturk) to Cairo coach. The plane was modern and comfortable and relatively spacious. The meal was bad but edible. Dry airline so if you like a drink in-air plan accordingly.

"Ft Lauderdale to Atlanta. Staff was unprofessional and seemed to be bothered by anyone asking questions. We flew to Ft. lauderdale for a cruise, of course the flight took off late. They said they were waiting for the crew to arrive. After a 7 day cruise we got to the airport already having to way 8 hours because we couldn't get an earlier flight, then got an email saying our flight was delayed 2 hours. While sitting at the gate it was delayed another hour. Went from 9pm to 12:50am. The current flight that was going to Chicago had gotten overbooked so they were asking for people to volunteer to stay in a hotel and leave out the next day. Then once we were on the plane, there was confusion with people's tickets and again, the boarding was delayed for ""waiting on the crew to arrive"". Because they were so late, they boarded everyone at the same time rather than going in Zones which made everything just more chaotic. We got to Atlanta so late, the shuttles weren't running and we had to take a bus to baggage claim, and the had put my boyfriend's luggage on the wrong flight so we had to take another hour to locate where it was and had to call an Uber to get to the parking garage because the shuttles weren't running. Finally was done with Spirit airlines about 4:30am. Worst traveling experience ever.",Detractor
Flew economy class from Toronto to Vancouver and back a week later. No free snacks or meal on the plane - just drinks offered a couple of times and some water.

" London to Thessaloniki via Istanbul. I would recommend to anyone who can avoid this airline to do so by all means. I cannot find words to describe their ""customer service"" and should anything go wrong during the trip you are left alone. Between booking and flying, TK changed the aircraft type and a flight time without informing me at all. I flew from LHR to IST and then my flight from IST to SKG was cancelled. It took me 2.5 hours at the transfer desk and stories I cannot even describe to get a ticket to return back to London as there was no other flight to my destination until the day after. I had a business class ticket, however when I went to the gate I was told they had overbooked the business class cabin and I would have to be downgraded to economy. Overall, I spent 34 hours without sleep only to return where I left from, without ever reaching my destination. And now several days later, I still haven't received a refund for my tickets. Avoid this airline and fly with one that knows how to treat customers.",Detractor
"  Berlin to Baltimore via Keflavik. Tickets are very aggressively priced compared to competitors. Everything in flight has a fee. Booking your seats. Prices start from 7.99 and range up to 50.99. Normally the flights are not full so if you're travelling with family or with others make sure you reach the airport a little early so you can choose your seats and get them together. Seats do recline but only a little. Legroom is pretty decent. They allow you one free carry on. Its a small bag (42x32x25cms) that can weigh up to 10Kgs. This means you can just carry a small (very small) backpack. Any normal cabin bag is bigger than the dimension. This way you will have to pay for the large cabin bag (56x45x25cms) that lets you carry 12kgs for $50.99. Make sure you dont have any extra purse or camera bags, they sometimes would count that as a carry-on. They are strict when it comes to this as this is the way they make their money. There is no IFE screen in flight. You can purchase a tablet for $12 thats loaded with movies and songs. You have a USB charger under each seat. No food is free inside the flight. Not even water. Price for a bottle of water was $2.7 and a turkey sandwich was $10. The layovers if your traveling to Europe from US is generally very short. Little over an hour. That's just enough to exit the plane and run to your next flight. I did not get a chance to pick any food in Iceland during the transit and had to eat in flight. Overall the flight was clean, ground staff and cabin crew were amazing. All the flights I took were on time or late by a few minutes. If you plan it right and your trip is short then you will save flying WOW air.",Passive

 San Francisco to Phoenix. I wish I could give this airline negative stars! I used to travel all of the time using any of the major airlines. I have gone through a lot in the last 5 years. Travel has been very scarce. I booked a 2 week trip overseas. My mistake was to let the touring company book the air for me and my second mistake was letting them choose United. They gave only a 45 minute wait between my 2nd and 3rd flight and the plane left over an hour late. Strike 1. My final flight of the day was with Lufthansa. Fortunately Lufthansa got me on another flight but I had to wait 7 hours in an airport. Thank you Lufthansa. Strike 2 United. Coming home from my trip the touring company booked me a 5 hour layover in San Francisco. I already had 24 hours of real traveling time scheduled. After 3 different gate changes in San Francisco they finally said they were having plane maintenance issues. An 8:00 pm flight has now been moved to 10:20 pm at yet another gate. The time I'm leaving this flight is later than my scheduled arrival! United Airlines cannot be trusted to take their passengers to their desired destination in a timely manner. For domestic flights I will now go with Southwest and for international I will go with Delta or Lufthansa.,Detractor
Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent!

" Flew Aer Lingus from DUB-CDG and return 22 March - 26 March 2018 with a 60-strong school group. Outbound flight was hassle-free, checkin was fast and fluid with staff dealing with flights for all over Europe and North America. Bags were checked in free of charge. Though, slightly fed up at this stage of having to proceed to a T1 departure gate after checking in at T2. One of our party was quite ill on the way out and the cabin staff were extremely professional, calming and reassuring. Flight landed 15 minutes ahead of schedule. Inbound, CDG-DUB was somewhat less hassle-free. Not sure who AL's agents are at CDG but Check-in was extremely slow with staff blaming the computer but there was no sense of urgency even thereafter. A trainee then arrived to take over from a more senior agent which slowed things further. On the plus side, bags were again taken free of charge. In the end, It took well over an hour to check us all in. Flight arrived at DUB 15 minutes ahead of schedule at 22.25 However, this time we pulled up at a T1 gate and had to wait to be bused to T2, delaying our ultimate arrival home further. T2 was opened in 2007 and I just don't understand this practice of then having to go back to T1 for the flight.",Passive
" I flew on Air Canada from Calgary to Las Vegas last December 28, 2018. I checked-in one luggage and had no carry on with me since it was a direct flight I didn't feel the need to bring a carry-on bag since all my things could fit in my checked-in luggage. I paid the baggage fee and checked-in earlier to make sure that I won't miss my flight. As soon as I passed through security I found out that my flight was delayed so I had no choice but to wait for another hour. That was tolerable and for whatever reason Air Canada would have I felt that I didn't need to make a big deal out of it. The worst part of my Air Canada experience was that upon Arrival in Las Vegas, I found out that my bag never made it to Las Vegas. I immediately went to the baggage claim office to file a report and they said that I would have to contact Air Canada so that they could trace my bag and send it to me. How the hell do you lose a luggage on a direct flight? Could you imagine how frustrating it was to be in a place where you literally had no clothes or any of your belongings with you for a 7 day trip? I have planned this vacation a long time ago and it was my only vacation for the year 2018. I have prepared a lot for this trip thinking that I would finally be able to relax and get my much needed rest. But I was wrong, Air Canada ruined my vacation because I mostly spent my time making a lot of phone calls, sending emails during the trip and what's worst is that I was only compensated for $200 which doesn't even compare or amount to the stress, hassle and huge inconvenience that they have caused me. They never really followed up anything with me during my whole vacation in Las Vegas. My luggage never arrived in Las Vegas. I had to literally buy everything in Vegas from underwear to toiletries. I had to always made time to just call them to check whether they have found my luggage. I never got the chance to give the presents that I have packed for my friends in Vegas. It was such a terrible and frustrating experience. As a frequent passenger of Air Canada I felt that this made me realize what kind of customer service Air Canada delivers in situations like this. Trust me, in case this happens to any of you, you can be assured that you will be getting the worst customer service. I never enjoyed my only vacation in Vegas in 2018 just because Air Canada failed to do their job and reassuring me that my luggage was safe and secured with them. If I never suggested the idea of calling the Calgary Airport to check whether my luggage is still there then I probably still don't have my luggage until now. There was no initiative on their part and their plan of action in reassuring their passengers that they will be able to track their luggage is very poor. It's sad to say that as I type this horrible experience from Air Canada, the $200 hasn't been paid. God knows when they will actually reply and take action on this. It's not even the money that I'm complaining about but its more on the amount of time that I wasted just to check the status of my luggage every now & then, the huge amount of stress thinking if I will ever find my luggage and my vacation plans were absolutely ruined just because everything that I needed for my trip was not with me all because of Air Canada's fault. How can you compensate all that? It's not like you can redo my vacation in Vegas all over again. The damage is done. I am so disappointed & frustrated with my experience with Air Canada. Never again.",Detractor
"  Stockholm to Denver via London Heathrow. The Boeing 747-400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution. The movies were quite limited. The seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated. There was limited space for storage, both bags and stuff in the seat pocket. A blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good. All and all not a bad experience - but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience.

" Sydney to New York via Houston. What a tired airplane with tired facilities and tired staff. The seats were so close to the isle I had to make sure my arm was inside the seat. Food when it came was great but when asked what my selection was from the menu I was told that I would be put on a waiting list to see if my choices were available I assume after feeding first class first which I have never heard of before. I asked for a bottle of water and was told due to cut backs it was one bottle per person per trip but they could refill it. Breakfast, I was told off by the stewardess who was super stressed during the flight, because I did not eat my corn flakes which she had to tell another passenger she could not have so I could eat them! My god, I paid over $7000 for a seat on this airplane to be told off because I did not eat my corn flakes! The bathrooms were so small I did not even bother to change my clothes not only because I could not move but there was either water or urine on the floor. Maybe I am spoiled as I have flown business with Qatar Airways and Emerites and they are spacious planes with stewards that are not stressed with big bathrooms that are cleaned regularly and a menu that when you ask for something that's is on the menu you are not told you will be waitlisted. Selection of movies very old. No new releases. No offer of any magazines or papers nothing. So I sit here at Houston waiting to board for the next leg of my journey hoping and praying it's better than the one from Sydney or I won't be flying with United long haul again.",Detractor

As I had kept screenshots of my booking, I produced the screenshots to Emirates. Finally, Emirates refund the actual difference of fares (total of 1 000 â‚¬ as I asked).

I was on flight 85 from Hanoi to Warsaw with connecting flight to Berlin. The Flight was scheduled for 11.55 but was delayed for 5 hrs. Unlike most passengers we realised there would be a delay 18 hrs in advance after having problems with the online check-in. Even though the airline was aware of a significant delay no effort was made to inform passengers. No information on our right to compensation under EU regulations was given either. Adding insult to injury the flight attendants on the plane ignored any request for information or service. At one stage I had the assistance lamp on for an hour before I gave up and went to the back to find attendants chatting leisurely. Breakfast consisted of a sandwich with cheese and water. No yoghurt or muffin as included in the regular meal. Again a sign of minimal effort. Even though this flight was relatively cheap it was not good value at all and staff made no effort to improve what was obviously a terrible experience.

"I recently flew Cathay Business Class from Singapore to London and back, via Hong Kong - a total of four sectors. While three of these flights varied from acceptable to quite good, the final leg from Hong Kong back to Singapore was awful. Having arrived late (see below) from London, we boarded yet another delayed flight only to find that, without any prior notification to us, they had switched the aircraft from the one on which we had booked our seats to one with the old A330 series 2-3-2 Business Class configuration. Not only is this more like sitting in Premium Economy, my wife and I were now separated by a passenger in the centre seat between us, with whom we had to negotiate a swap. With the flight already twenty minutes late, it was then announced that we had to wait for connecting passengers from yet another delayed Cathay flight, and we eventually pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. Once airborne things didn't improve. While the crew were courteous enough, the food was an absolute disgrace for Business Class. We both had to send our dried-out, tough and tasteless fish entrees back, and the replacement noodles had all the attributes of a convenience store offering. The toilets, which began the flight having seen better days, were filthy by the end of it, with discarded paper overflowing from the rubbish bin and the floor wet. I will avoid flying Cathay Pacific in future for fear of encountering another flight like this one. It's a shame, because their new Business seat is actually very well thought out, and the touch-screen entertainment system excellent. But for me there's just too much risk of delays, poor food, and encountering the outdated 2-3-2 Business Class cabin to warrant the asking price. Out of our four sectors, push-back from the gate was delayed on three of them by 60, 40 and 50 minutes respectively. I hope we were just unlucky, because these statistics don't make good reading: 75% of our flights delayed by an average of 50 minutes.",Detractor
"  Atlanta to Dallas Love Field. Our frustrating and unexpectantly expensive situation with Southwest Airlines began on Sunday August 6th 2017 after having spent a wonderful weekend in Georgia at Ft. Benning to celebrate our son's graduation from Boot Camp. Our group consisted of our son's 3 parents and 1 elderly grandmother who needs physical assistance getting around. Ready to head to the Atlanta airport to catch our flight (2419) back to Dallas Love Field, we received an elctronic message stating that our flight was cancelled due to thunderstorms over Dallas. We called home (Dallas) to check with our house sitter and other friends to hear what the weather was like. They said there were no storms at all. It was clear skies and very hot. I checked my weather app and saw no storms in the DFW area. We called Southwest customer service who said we could spend the night in a hotel in Atlanta and catch a flight to Dallas the next morning. But we needed to get back to work the next morning (a Monday). We asked for reimbursement for the 4 tickets we will need to by from other airlines. SWA Rep said we would need to call Customer Relations. But a refund is not possible since the cancellation was due to weather! When we arrived at the Atlanta airport we ran to the American Airlines ticket window and bought the last 2 AA tickets flying to DFW that evening for $536.40! AA ticket counter rep told us all flights to Dallas and DFW airports were flying with no weather issues. So we let our son's mother and elderly grandmother have these 2 tickets since we were not sure there would be any other available flights out that night. Then we ran to the other end of the terminal to the Delta ticket counter. We bought 2 tickets to DFW for $654.32! Delta also confirmed no weather issues flying into the DFW area. The total for 4 tickets including terminal fees cost us $1,217.72! I called SWA Customer Relations the next day to inquire about a refund for the 4 tickets we had to purchase due to the SWA cancellation. We spoke to SWA Customer Relations rep at the corporate office in Dallas TX. He said no refund is given when a cancellation is made due to weather. He said the FAA said there were thunderstorms over Dallas. I shared that I called friends in various locations in Dallas and NO ONE saw a single could in the sky. I shared that ALL other airlines were flying from Atlanta to Dallas that afternoon and evening with no knowledge of storms in Dallas. SWA refused to offer even partial compensation. He said talking to anyone above him would be wasting my time and would not transfer me to a supervisor. I hung up. It was obvious SWA was not going to acknowledge they made a mistake cancelling our flight or even apologize for causing such unnecessary stress and expense costing us over $1,200.00 in additional ticket fees.",Detractor

We flew on Christmas eve from London Gatwick - Jakarta - Perth. We arrived at the airport with a voicemail from them stating that we may not be able to get on our connecting flight due to stopping in Amsterdam on the way through. The voicemail told us to ask at the desk when we checked in but they had no idea what was going on either. Onto the flight getting on the plane was a disappointment it was old the seats had stains on and me and my family were seated apart and the crew had no interest in helping us. The meals were either over-cooked or cold the entertainment system needed updating with newer films and games etc. We were in the air for Christmas day and although we did not mind doing this there was no Christmas spirit on the flight not even a 'merry Christmas' from the captain when we landed. I understand that Indonesia is not a country which celebrates Christmas but it just would have been nice for them to acknowledge it. There isn't enough legroom for a long haul flight - if someone in front of you has their seat reclined you've got no chance of getting to sleep yourself. On the way back I was told that only 7kg of hand luggage was allowed even though on the way there there hadn't been a problem this resulted in me having to actually move 1.5 kilos out of my hand luggage to someone else's hand luggage that was in my party!

" Mumbai to Edinburgh via London. I'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as I have always had a great experience with BA in terms of in-flight service and airport handling. After sales service can be a different experience! This flight I arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues, hot and sweaty and the check-in girl was such a blessing. She calmed me down, reassured me and helped me get through security swiftly. I was able to secure a very cheap last-minute upgrade to Premium Economy and I am so glad I did. The service was wonderful, we were looked after very well, lots of water offered throughout the flight. I thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable, even for the regular upgrade price, 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre, gives you a lot more space. The food was ok, I've had worse, I've had better. But I was comfortable, a good temperature and had a great choice of films. My connecting plane was late leaving Heathrow to Edinburgh due to bad weather, but it was handled very nicely. All in all I'm glad I flew BA for this trip.",Promoter
"Heathrow to Manila via Beijing. I was somewhat apprehensive about flying Air China after reading the reviews. I can say both my outbound and return flights were quite pleasant. The flights were on time, cabin crew were pleasant enough, the food was palatable and the entertainment system was adequate. The level of English spoken by the cabin crew was not particularly high but isn't impossible to overcome. Let's not forget this is a Chinese airline which seems to cater to a largely Chinese clientele. Value for money was excellent and I would fly with them again.",Promoter
" Amsterdam to Singapore. Greedy airline that fits 10 tiny seats in a row in a 777-300 plane, which makes it impossible to sit comfortable in a 13 hours flight. It is so horrible that there is no way to avoid not sitting squeezed, shoulder to shoulder with the person next to you, and I am not a big person. And my seat was a so called ""economy comfort"" seat, the other seats clearly had a matching small leg space as well. Not clean plane had a face mark on the window from the previous passenger, I cleaned it myself. Terrible food.. They used to be a very nice airline but after that experience I will never fly with them again.",Detractor
"  Auckland to Wellington. This was my first time on Air New Zealand, and it was a pleasant experience. The cabin crew were very attentive, which made me comfortable.

Went from BUF to TPA in February. The flight was on time (both directions). The plane was clean and had decent leg room. The kids liked the TVs and snacks.

"Paris to Bangkok via Doha with Qatar Airways. In a word excellent. Business class does not get better than this with regard to service, food, cabin layout and ambiance. The seat was magnificent with controls that got you into the seat or lying position of your choice. I connected with Aer Lingus from Dublin bypassing the more direct option using either Etihad or Emirates. Smart move. I have used both of these airlines in business on a few occasions and although good in themselves come nowhere near the Qatar Airways product for its elegance, comfort and consistency. Being part of the one world alliance is also an added bonus. Rightly the number one airline offering a lounge in Doha that is just unbeatable. I look forward to their arrival some day into the Irish market.",Promoter

The plane was technologically advanced than its peers. Seat pitch was OK. IFE was very good.",Promoter
"  Las Vegas to San Antonio. The customer service for Frontier has to be the worst customer service I have had to deal with. Almost a month after booking my flight I receive a email that my reservation has changed and my flight from a direct flight to one with a layover, and has been moved up 10 hours with no other option to change to that day. I would have to either move up my flight nearly a day or pos pone by a day. They are unable to compensate for the inconvenience and cost that I will incur for having to book another flight so last minute. I understand things change but I have never had a flight change 10 hours unless weather related. There was no explanation for this change besides flight paths have been adjusted. When trying to reach a customer service representative I waited on hold for 3 hours the first day and never got through, and 1 hour the next day to finally get ahold of someone who was simply reading a script and clicking prompts.",Detractor

"Flew the new 787 in business class from Paris to Mexico city on Dec 19th. Flight attendant refused to speak English. Served dinner about 45 minutes later than in economy class meal was lukewarm. Exactly 5 minutes later she showed up again noticed that I was still eating and asked me if I was done. The reason became clear right after desert was served. On this 12 hour flight there is only service in the first 2.5 hours and in the 90 minutes before landing. 8 full hours there is no flight attendant no drinks no snacks. They expect you to sleep and not bother the flight crew. If you can't sleep it will be a long flight. Entertainment is very limited. Movies in the section new are at least a year old. You have about 10 to choose from. Watching out of the window is prohibited by AeroMexico. The windows will be darkened 15 minutes after take off until 5 minutes before touchdown. Service was better in economy class on this flight. Expect AeroMexico business class at the level of ""Premium economy class"" on any other skyteam airline. For sure not worth the extra money.",Detractor
"The air vents didn't work (or was disabled) through the flight, the crew was not pleasant. There is no on-board entertainment unless you download their Rouge app and use your own device. I had to rent an ipad for 10.00. The products they advertise in their brochure (tucked into the seat in front of you) was not what they actually sold on the plane. The films they advertised in the flyer was not the films you were given on the ipad. In fact, there were mostly older films and very few new releases to chose from. The captain had the fasten seatbelt light on so much that people couldn't get to the bathroom most of the time, you couldn't get up to move around, and it was 2.5 hours before we even got a hot drink! Would never fly Air Canada rouge again.",Detractor
"Short trip to Vienna in BA Economy Class from Terminal 3. New A320 cabin on the flight out - looks nice and fairly comfortable for a couple of hours. Other than the cheap, highly processed cheese and ham croissant and a coffee you are given it is no different to a low cost airline. Staff service minimal - they served breakfast and collected the leftovers, basically in the cabin twice during the entire 2 hour and 10 minute flight - not even an additional beverage service. I'm sure if they were flogging the drinks it would be different. Return a couple of days later, older aircraft but clean. Same indifferent service, similar processed carbs handed out in silence and 1 drink. This wasn't a cheap ticket (over 200GBP) - I know BA are competing with low cost airlines in Europe but when are they going to realise they aren't a low cost airline? A bit of chat from the staff and a couple of extra coffees would have made all difference to how I felt leaving those flights. BA sadly seem to be falling behind the crowd.",Detractor
"  Spirit is the most untrustworthy airline. They sent me a email at 7pm in the evening that my New York LGA to Chicago flight is cancelled.

Now I don't know what to do for my flight. Please don't fly with this airline, they offer you cheap price tickets but then at the end they cancelled the flight and reason will make you laugh - ""due to no crew for the flight"".

  We used Air Canada rouge as a connection from Toronto to Cancun flying from London. The outwards journey was ok. The plane was a little scruffy and dirty but it was on time and functional. However the return journey is proving to be much worse. There is a 7 hour delay - no explanation given yet. They have checked us in but not confirmed our new connections to London as we will miss our scheduled connection. They blame Air Canada for this as they are not Air Canada. We joined the queue at 8.30 and at 11.30 are checked in and being bussed to a hotel to wait to be called. Delays happen but the lack of information and consideration for onward connections is very poor.,Detractor

"The inflight experience with LH was fairly positive, but ground experience was terrible. The first issue was small. While waiting for LH 1392 in FRA, we were denied access to the LH business lounge because our boarding card showed economy despite presenting the ticket which clearly showed business. We were travelling with backpacks which fit in the carry on luggage sizing rack at the gate. However, the gate agent would not allow them as carry on items because we had to push them down to get them into the rack. We observed larger suitcases being carried onboard without being challenged. Two of us quickly repacked our packs to the satisfaction of the gate agent. However, the third member of our party was unable to repack as quickly and was threatened with having her ticket cancelled. While she was eventually able to repack her bag to the satisfaction of the agent, she was quite flustered by the experience. The flight was not full (contradicting claims made by the gate agent) and there were lots of empty seats and luggage bins on board.",Detractor
"  Short haul flight from Boston to Washington D.C.-Reagan on an A319. This was my first time flying any American airline and I had no expectations whatsoever. However, this flight was one of the best short-haul flights I've ever been on. Push back in Boston was on-time. Service was on par with a lot of other airlines, or even better. Seat width was more than the rumoured sardine can and seat pitch was generous for a narrow body plane. Slimline seats didn't bother me much",Promoter
"  Los Angeles to Frankfurt. Already At Check-in Lufthansa provides First Class service: If one wishes, a staff member guides you through the Fast Track in Security in Los Angeles to the Lounge, and if requested from the lounge into the plane.

First Cabin in on the main deck in the nose of the aircraft and very airy. The design is very nice, and very seat has still the beautiful and fresh red rose. The only disappointment is the small size of the screen and the quality of the bed (not the best flat bed is not the best in the industry.

Flew to Lisbon last minute so I was not able to get a non-stop flight. There were two legs to my trip JFK-CDG then CDG-LIS. Before I arrived at the airport Air France issued us one boarding pass that worked for both our flights. Flight scheduled to leave at 7.15. However the morning of the flight we received a notification that our flight had been delayed 2 hours. Upon arrival at JFK staff were very friendly and updated us. Lounge in JFK was the nicest I have seen excellent food spacious and comfortable. JFK-CDG was aboard an A380. Boarding took place through two gates so did not take as long as I thought made comfortable by the fact that Air France was sensitive to the boarding time and distributed drinks hot towels and an amenities kit while economy was boarding. Staff spoke excellent English and announcements were made in both French and English. Flight attendants were friendly the seats fully reclined and the pillow and blanket were comfortable. Plane was clean and bathrooms spacious. Individual TV's with plenty of choice. Passengers kept well informed throughout. Upon arrival in Paris immigration took about 5 seconds. A little disappointed with the lounge at CDG. Flight to Lisbon delayed 40 minutes. Flight aboard a B737. Service on this flight was surly. Overall I would definitely take the transatlantic flight again but would try to avoid the CDG-LIS flight.,Promoter
"  I had an excellent experience flying Spirit Airlines from La Guardia to Detroit roundtrip. My travel plans changed at the last minute, and the cost of the Spirit roundtrip was far less than the change fee Delta would have applied to my original ticket. Because I was traveling by myself on a short trip, it was easy to take just a personal item and to print my boarding pass at home--meaning I avoided any additional fees from Spirit. I was pleasantly surprised by the condition of the aircraft. The outbound was a very new-looking Airbus, while the return was another A320 with slightly older seats but refreshed interior. Frankly, the condition of both planes was far superior to my most recent flights on American and Delta. The seats themselves were fine for a flight less than 3 hours",Promoter
"London to Montreal. It's always a pleasure to get a great deal and a great ride. I booked this trip to UK for Xmas back in August for three people (12 adults and 1 teenager) including extra baggage and seat assignment for less than $1,000 cad each. I had very low expectations. One the return flight we had an older A330, which definitely looks old school now, but with better leg room and personal space than the Boeing 787. The seats feel abused and lacking cushion for sure. Having said that the crew were pleasant, easy going and efficient. They served drinks, then a meal service, then another drinks service, then a snack service and I can say for once I wasn't hungry or grossed out by what they offered. Even got a ""free"" 2nd bottle of cheap red wine. The flight was ahead of schedule landing and we even relaxed enough to socialize with our fellow passengers on board and make new friends. Kudos to Air Canada for a really great economy experience. I still prefer biz or premium economy!",Promoter
"Flew from Rzeszow to Newark via Munich. Flight from Rzeszow to Munich, only 1 hour, was pretty uneventful. Free sandwich and drink. Very small plane, and as a 6 foot tall man, I barely fit in the cabin. The crew was very nice, and spoke fluent English with Polish greetings at the beginning and end of the flight. Flight from Munich to Newark was also phenomenal. Economy class is just like any other, nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, and the service was superb. The A340 is a very comfortable aircraft with a nice feature: the bathrooms are downstairs. We landed 45 minutes earlier, and the transfer was easy. I have been flying with Lufthansa for 4 years now, and it is always easier to fly with them through Frankfurt or Munich rather than drive to JFK just to fly with LOT.

"I received an email 4 weeks before my travel date to say that my Sofia to Lubeck flight had been cancelled. Initially I was fine with this, but after speaking to their Call Centre I was left very angry and upset with Wizz Air's customer service levels. Firstly, they told me that there were no alternative flights they could offer, which again was not a major problem as I assumed that they would agree to refund my outbound flight from Bristol to Sofia. I was wrong. They refused to offer a refund for the unaffected flight even though I booked both sectors at the same time, and seemed happy for me to fly out to Sofia and leave me stranded there with no way of travelling onwards without paying significantly more money to rebook with a different airline. The call centre agent constantly criticised me for repeating myself which, even if true, is extremely poor service. Ironically, he kept repeating the mantra of 'you will have to complain via the website'. To put this into context, I was refused a refund of just Â£38 for the unaffected flight which is a very small price to pay to keep a customer happy and to give me the option to rebook alternative flights. As it turned out, the small matter of Â£38 means that I will never book with Wizz Air again - not because of the flight cancellation (which I can accept) but because of their very poor customer service levels.",Detractor
One of the worst long distance flight experiences I have had. IAD to Addis Ababa return with an additional 3 Ethiopian domestic leg. Not one flight left on time with absolutely no explanation from Ethiopian. Return flight from Addis to Washington DC left 3 hours late which resulted in missing my connections. I was advised that someone from Ethiopian would be available upon arrival to rebook my continuing flight. Not only was no one there it took another 3 hours to finally get some help from them and then they were so slow I missed the connection they booked me on. 4 people inside the Ethiopian office and 3 of the 4 doing nothing except talking on their personal cell phones. Inflight experience wasn't much better. My TV monitor had no sound the monitor in the empty seat next to me didn't work at all and I left my flight attendant light on for 4 hours and not one attendant ever responded to it. The only positive comment I have is their 777 coach class was comfortable.,Passive
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Good flight on time all good until we arrived. Waited at luggage carousel until no more bags and then visit lost luggage counter. It turns out the pilot ordered 50 bags to be left because of bad weather. Presumably to avoid lodging more fuel since it was only a 2 hour flight on a 737. SAA could have told us when we arrived and not gone through the lost baggage charade. The one guy left to deal with 50 angry people did a fantastic job and bags were delivered next day as promised.,Passive

I tried to get a seat in the first row and read the magazines provided by the airline, eat the fantastic DO&CO catered lunch and enjoyed myself. The price of 900 Euros for the roundtrip was a bit steep, but the experience was always pleasant. This year no more. I bought a ticket for the same route, same 900 Euros but the trip was terrible.

Just returned from a trip Oz - Guangzhou plus an internal flight. The planes (A380 and A320) were very satisfactory being modern and adequately comfortable albeit with minimal seat and aisle sizes. Every flight seemed full. I would strongly recommend a home-packed picnic basket for self catering on board including a screw- top bottle of wine from the duty free shop airside. I considered the food served minimalist unpalatable and easily bypassed. The cabin attendants are well below international standard. Could even learn from Lufthansa and KLM! If CSA were the most convenient and best value option I would travel again with them but follow my own advice above.,Passive
" We flew round trip between Chicago and Madrid in Iberia business. Our experience on both flights was outstanding. Check in was quick and lounges in both cities were excellent with the American Airlines O'Hare lounge being exceptional. Cabin crews on both flights were pleasant and efficient. Iberia's business class seat is comfortable although the aisle seats lack privacy and are subject to bumping by folks passing by. We selected a pair of ""honeymoon"" seats to avoid those issues. Iberia offered frequent beverage service that included good wines. Only their coffee was lacking (I wondered if they use robusta rather than arabica coffee) Our main meals were some of the best we have ever had in business class. My grilled bream was one of the best fish meals that I have ever enjoyed and equaled fish I ate at quality Spanish restaurants. I've included a picture of my fish entree and the appetizer service which could be a meal by itself. Even the arrival procedures in both cities went quickly and smoothly. We plan on flying Iberia again on an upcoming European trip and appreciate the effort they are making to provide a top notch business class product.",Promoter
Four QF sectors over Christmas/New Year AKL-MEL MEL-PER PER-SYD SYD-HNL.

"  Cathay Pacific premium economy is it worth it? The answer is only if the airplane is new. We flew from Hong Kong to Vancouver, and aside from service and food, the seats were just a tad bigger than economy seats. On the return, it was really like flying economy with the seat configuration being 2-4-2. Seat pitch was narrow and cramped. The only time we felt we were on premium economy was the Manila to Hong Kong leg of the trip because we had flown with a new plane and seats was noticeably wider. However meal was like economy - a boxed juice and a boxed sandwich. It's a good thing we paid the promo price. Unless you are assured of flying the new planes, I do not see any difference flying premium Eco as compared to economy except for a better service than economy.",Passive
 Travelled in Qatar First class (Doha to Perth). I am a gold member in Emirates but has decided to change carrier and tried Qatar Airways. I was not disappointed. In flight service in first is excellent. Crew were extremely friendly and clearly wanted to give a five star experience to their customers. Doha first class lounge is the best I have been. No doubt they have won a lot of awards. You need to travel with them to appreciate their superb service. A380 first class lacks as much privacy as in emirates but the seat and service makes up for all that. There are only 8 seats and crew give total attention and makes the journey one of the most memorable.,Promoter

Potato chip crumbs on my seat, oily screen, urine all over floor/toilet in bathroom which leads me to believe the plane was never kept or cleaned before our boarding. At 11.43am we were still on the tarmac and they said that something mechanical was wrong with the plane. We then returned to the gate. It is now 1.36pm and we have reboarded the plane. We still have not left. They are saying that they still have no further information. On top of that, the crew have asked us to have sympathy for them. Delta is laughable.

"  Singapore to Jakarta on an A350-900 (9V-SMD). Flight left behind schedule. We waited for like 30+ minutes after scheduled departure time on ground in Singapore before push back to avoid getting trapped in air traffic congestion in Jakarta. Excellent communication from Flight Deck. Flight Attendants on this flight worked hard, providing lunch service with two drink runs on a full flight for such a short flight (1 hour 20 minutes). FAs were very cheerful and polite. I pre-ordered in-flight merchandise (aircraft models) and they brought it to me before the flight lands. Aircraft was a new A350, the cabin was bright and airy. and large windows adding to a sense of space. Entertainment using the latest touchscreen which is very easy and fun to use. Only gripe I had was one piece of our luggage was stranded in Singapore and didn't make it on our flight, but after checking with SQ baggage service person in Jakarta we were told that it will arrive on the next flight from Singapore 2.5 hours later. The issue with the delayed/misplaced bag happened most likely because we were connecting in Singapore an hour before this flight from our previous flight from Houston.",Promoter
" Worst flying and layover experience ever. I recently went to Cairo from Singapore (with a layover in Jeddah). The first flight (Singapore - Jeddah) was pretty okay, probably because we were less than 40 people. Once we landed in Jeddah, the nightmare began. Jeddah is probably the worst airport I have ever been to. Nobody can speak English. The Jeddah - Cairo flight was delayed. On TV, it was displayed that the boarding was taking place which was misleading. Once I was finally told that we could go (by another passenger who could speak both Arabic and English, the Saudia staff didn't help at all), we had to take a bus. We then arrived in front of the plane but we had to stay inside the bus for 20 minutes since the cleaning staff was still inside the plane. Once we landed in Cairo, it took about 1 hour to get the luggage. On the way back (from Cairo to Singapore via Jeddah), the flight experience was pretty terrible, especially on the Jeddah - Singapore part (via Kuala Lumpur). There was a lot of turbulence and kids were running, literally! The cabin staff didn't do anything at all to inform parents that the kids should remain seated. They didn't care at all. Once we finally landed in Singapore, I was told that my luggage had been lost along the way. I thought I was going to be the only one. We were only 18 people for the Kuala Lumpur - Singapore part. Out of the 18, I met 7 other people who did not get their baggage. They were coming from Paris, Istanbul and Cairo. I haven't heard from Saudia yet but I will never fly with them again.",Detractor
"  Gatwick to Barcelona. This was my first time flying with Vueling and definitely the last time! I supposed to be flying on the 1st June from Gatwick to Barcelona. 10 minutes after the departure when nobody at the airport knew anything they told us our flight has been cancelled?! We were told there was a strike, that's why the flight got cancelled. No communication at the airport whatsoever, we waited 4 hours at the airport for the hotel. They were telling us they can't find the hotel for us. Then after 4 hours of waiting and given only 7 GBP for a food per person they told us the shuttle is coming, but the hotel is at Radisson Blue at Heathrow? Another 1 hour on the bus. Upon arrival at the hotel again nobody knew what time is the shuttle leaving in the morning. Thanks god I woke up early so I could check at the the reception where they said the shuttle is leaving in 30 mins. They didn't even bothered to inform us/ call us. The rescheduled flight was for Sat evening which I didn't want to wait another whole day as another guests from the same flight were flying at 2pm. Again when we asked at the airport why I am flying much later I have been told it's up the price the guest paid for the flight and if the guest is flying often with them? I managed to reschedule the flight for 2pm after calling the customer service in the morning but almost didn't make it as we waited for 1 lady for over 30 mins who didn't know when is the shuttle leaving and wasn't ready. I finally made it to Barcelona with 1 day of delay. I also have been told over the phone when calling on sat 2nd of June that I am entitled for a compensation of 250 EUR. She also said to keep the receipt for some food bought on the plane and they will refund it. On the way back to Luton on the 6th June the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. What a surprise when they emailed me back today afternoon that I am getting no compensation as this wasn't their fault [congestion of the air traffic]. I was told by the lady from customer service on the phone that it was air controllers strike. Honestly this was the most stressful holiday ever for me and it ruined my holiday + I lost money for the attraction I have booked for Sat 2nd of June in Barcelona as it was non refundable.

"Several flights over the last couple of months the most recent which was DAL-STL-BWI-LIT-DAL. Online check-in and bag check has been painless crews have been friendly and occasionally even entertaining and all flights have either been on-time if not a little early. Flights have been on a variety of 737s (300 500 and 700 series) both with the new and old seats. All seats provide 32-33"" pitch and better legroom than most domestic carriers. However planes with the newer seats can be a little uncomfortable on the thighs after 3 hours or so beware on longer flights. Price of WiFi has recently been increased to $8 or $5 for streaming TV/movies only but you can access Southwest.com a shopping site and a flight tracker for free. Free soft drinks are provided along with either peanuts/pretzels and/or a bag of chips (only on longer flights). I paid for EarlyBird on some flights checked in exactly 24 hours before on others and forgot a couple of times and checked in a few hours after. Beware that if you either don't pay for EarlyBird or forget to check-in exactly 24 hours in advance you will end up in the mid-B group and you will have your carry-on checked as bin space runs out by that point.

I tracked the punctuality of the flight in the two days before my own and it was five hours late and four hours late respectively so I should have been relieved that we were taxiing only one hour late although my dream of a morning arrival in California was dashed. The reason given was late arrival of the inbound aircraft but with all the flight tracking apps these days airlines are going to have to be more creative with their excuses - our aircraft had arrived from Paramaribo hours earlier and on schedule. New business class seat on KLM is pretty good note that only window seats have a little shelf next to the headrest so I had room for books iPod et al but not sure what aisle pax are supposed to do with their stuff. Food was excellent was sorry they didn't have a spare as I would have eaten it up despite being quite full. Only downside was the crew were not very friendly overall and one in particular was extremely unhappy to be there a lot of hostility on show which is inappropriate given what biz class pax have paid. Landed half an hour late still one of the first international arrivals of the day so immigration took only a couple of minutes and bags were delivered promptly. I would take this flight again but hope for a happier crew next time.,Passive
Flew UAL 218 first class from HNL-ORD then connected to UAL express ORD-YWG. Service better than expected. 777-200 had recliner seats with no flatbeds for an 8 hour flight. No inflight entertainment as WiFI was not working and the old school entertainment system had already been removed. In-Charge offered all passengers compensation through UA Website. Offer on the web site was $125 off the next UA Flight for US residents or 10% off next UA flight to be used within 1 year for international travellers. Dinner and breakfast were served. Quality of both meals were OK and reminded me of Y class meals from days gone by. Ice cream sundae cart made the rounds after dinner. First Class Attendants ensured beverages were topped up and one FA even made sure water glasses were topped up while passengers slept. Difficult to find a comfortable position to sleep in recliner chairs. However the ticket price was reasonable for the passenger space offered on the aircraft. For an 8 hour overnight flight First class should offer flatbeds IMHO. UAL Express connector flight ORD-YWG ran 1 hour late due to off loading of baggage when connecting passengers failed to show. Almost an expected delay on any airline these days.,Passive
Recently my wife and I had a round-trip to Jamaica. Our flight 1042 from Chicago on Dec 26 was delayed 1.5 hrs because one of the lavatories was found non-operational. However the crew learned about it after all passengers had boarded the plane. Boarding started on time on the way back from Montego Bay however after a third of all passengers had boarded the crew found out that 3 seats were non-operational. The flight (Jan 2nd #1043) was oversold. It took a while to find 3 passengers who agreed to take another flight by delaying their return to Chicago. Could the problem with 3 seats identified before starting the boarding? I think Southwest has some opportunities for improving operations.,Passive
 San Francisco to Los Angeles. This is the worst nightmare. I do consider not flying delta again. First the system was down and the fly delay 40 mins at the gate. Then when we started boarding the gate attendant insisted that I tucked my 2inch x 4inch clutch inside my bag because it is the third bag. Then we proceed on to the plane and noticed that due to runway conflict we are now going to wait for another 40mins inside the airplane. Or at least that is the minimum estimate of wait wait time. This is worst efficiency at its lowest.,Detractor
" I was flying from Frankfurt to Chicago with Lufthansa on a 747-800. During the check-in process I reserved a seat in the emergency exit row. The seat was comfortable and given the fact that it was in the emergency exit, I had enough more than enough legspace. But even the regular economy class seats are comfortable. Selection of food and drinks was good and the crew was friendly. I was a bit hungry and would have liked a snack serice during the flight, the crew had light snacks availble at the galley upon request. Inflight entertainment in every seat and wifi available (for an additional fee). I enjoyed this Lufthansa flight and appreciate the benefits of Star Alliance.",Promoter
" Sacramento to New York. At the day of my flight, I went to the airport and I surprised that there is a special line for New York travelers, then I knew that the airplane got cancelled! Without even knowing then I tried to find different route because it is a board exam and I won't be able to postpone it. And after plenty of begging I was able to change my routes to SF then to NY. Both flights got delayed and we still don't know the reason! Finally, today I'm going back to Sacramento, and now I'm at the airport and received a text message telling me that the plane got delayed 1 hr and 30 min!

" Not a pleasant experience. The seats, the equipments look old and dirty, you wouldn't want to look at the magazines as they looked like they had been there forever. I took the morning flight when I flew to Osaka and noon flight when I returned. The breakfast was terrible, but the lunch on the return flight was quite good, a bit beyond my expectation. The cabin crew delivered the worst service I have ever experienced. No smile on their face, when I stop one of them for a cup of tea, they look annoyed and not willing to do so. Waste and garbage on all desks as the crew didn't care to collect them when they saw them. I actually brought my own tray of finished food to the crew and saw them sitting chatting. No one checked your seatbelt, no one came round to make sure your seat was upright when the plane took off and landed. Conclusion: Acceptable environment, not bad food, terrible service.",Detractor

The cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight. I was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room. The IFE system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings. On the plus side the cabin staff were friendly, helpful and courteous and this is somewhere BA seem to do well. Food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class. Boarding at YVR was very well organised, less so at the Heathrow end. It is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped Terminal 3 at Heathrow. Overall a reasonable experience, but one that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish.",Passive

" I've never wrote an review for anything in my life. But from my last experience from American Airlines, I made it my obligation to review this poor flight. I had a flight from Norfolk to San Diego via Dallas. I arrive at my flight on time just for them to delay my flight for an hour. Finally take off and when I arrive at Dallas my flight was just now taking off. I was extremely annoyed. Had to wait in a line for up to an hour and a half since there was an absurd amount of people that missed their flight as well. Was told that my next guaranteed flight will be that next following day, but I have the option to wait for the last available flights of that night, I will just be on stand by. Waited for 3 long hours to see if me and my girlfriend can squeeze in but we got denied. I was told I was number 14 on the list but another administrator told me I was number 12 on the stand by list. Very unorganized. The only positive thing that came from this was that they gave us an hotel voucher for the night. However, I was told that my bags had already took off without me and I will have to go get them at the baggage claim when I arrive at SD. Not only that, but when I was in a line for my hotel voucher, you can even hear the customer assistance saying â€œI'm leaving in 2 minutes, Im going home.â€ Mind you there are groups of people waiting to find a place to stay that have been traveling all day long. What type of service is that? Glad to know that American Airlines care about their passengers. That next following morning I wait by the gate to board my flight that was around 06:20. Came to find out that they switched the flight to another gate number when I went to the help desk to see if I was at the right location. Thank god I asked or I would of missed out on another flight. Nobody even notified us that the gate number even had changed. What type of service is that? I will never in my life fly this company again. The apocalypse can occur and they can have the last flight to safety and I still wouldn't take it. This company doesn't care about anything but their wallets.",Detractor
" This review is based on my future travel in February 2019. Already am disappointed. I successfully once logged in in December 2018 and tried to arrange my seat. At that time there was nothing available unless you pay extra to reserve some economy seat in advance in the front part of the plane. All I want is just an isle seat no matter if it is in the very rear section. They block all others economy seats and ""force"" you to pay for certain seat. So I came back in January 2019 and tried my luck but You can't seem to find your booking because the website keeps showing there is an error no matter how many times you try. It showed your booking doesn't exist.Now the only option I have is to wait for the day and ask for the check in crew help at the airport. Hopefully the aisle seat still available.",Detractor

Just flew from Portland to Chicago with my husband and the kids. We read all the bag pricing and ticket printing before hand. Those that complain about the counter fees and bag fees have no one to blame but themselves. We checked in online and printed our own tickets. We pre-paid $20 each for two checked bags that was it! Not $20 there and than $20 on the return flight. Delta was was $25 each way! The counter clerk was super helpful and polite doing the fast bag drop off. The biggest problem were the other passengers feeling they were entitled and crying babies on the red eye. My kids are 9+ so I'm not used to it and I never traveled with them on a plane as babies. Overall my experience was excellent. Oh if you're a family don't pick your seats if your staying in coach the counter lady told me they will keep you all together no matter what if there is children. I could keep going on about how easy this airline was to deal with but most people listen to those that complain and want to spend less and expect more.,Promoter
"Heathrow to New York JFK with American Airlines. For the price, AA is the best I've experienced so far in Economy. Definitely the best value for the money. Seats are nothing to cheer for, but they are definitely okay. I could sit in the middle seat without much discomfort. It's not like I could stretch out my legs or anything but it's called Economy for a reason. Food was good. Choices were a vegetarian pasta dish, or chicken with rice. I had the chicken. and it was good as far as airline food goes. The bread, cheese, salad and brownie that went along with it were also good. A nicely varied meal. Drinks, including beer and wine were complimentary. Unfortunately all they had for beer was Budweiser but what else can you expect from AA? This was a good crew. No fake smiles - they were just regular people treating me like a regular person. Efficient, and I felt completely safe with them. Entertainment was great. Screens were big enough, and the picture quality was good. Good selection of movies, from new blockbusters to old classics. The complimentary earbuds were actually good, considering they were free. The flight did have WiFi on board, but I couldn't get it to connect. Don't know if it was because of the connection or my device. I would fly with AA again, and I am fairly certain that I will soon. I am giving this review a 10, based on my own experience. Out of all long haul flights I have made personally, I enjoyed AA the most.",Promoter

" San Francisco to Frankfurt. Worst airline in the world is United Airlines. I'm a gold member for many years. The airlines constantly has flight delay, extremely bad or worst customer services - bad attitude of gate agent, attendants, and all known to everyone the worst food services among all the airlines I've experienced. I fly often with European and Asian airlines, even latin american airlines, all I have received much better services than from United. This is the latest experience I had just 2 days ago traveling from SFO to Reykjavik connecting at Frankfurt. Notified in the morning of departure, flight was delayed for 1 hour 15 min. I have 1 hour 35min connection at Frankfurt originally. Got to airport, the check-in agent said the flight should take off per new time and will arrive only 30min than original. It turned out flight was late departure for 2 hour 15min, and arrived 1 hour 10 min later than planned. And got text message at FRA saying they put me on the flight next day midnight arrival to Iceland. That is 1 and half day later. I only going to be at Iceland for 3 days. Then to make things worse, they couldn't get my baggage transfer to the new flight that I had switched to at FRA airport. Now I'm stuck at Iceland without any clothes and can't get out in the cold weather. Here is the contrast, at the SFO airport, a gate agent of United, at the elite / premium line, was extremely rude. I hand over my passport and he handed back and said ""open to the photo page"". With 1 hour delay, and line up, and even at the premium line, this is United's attitude. And to compare to the agent of Lufthansa airlines at FRA airport gate, the 2 ladies was very friendly, and went out of their ways to help me, and put me on a same day flight connecting to Iceland only 5 hour later than my original flight. They didn't send me to the United customer service, which is what I would expect any gate agent or airline services in US airports would do. They made many phone calls while asking me to wait and took care of everything and handed over my new boarding pass and told me they've notified baggage handling of my new flights.",Detractor

BKK-NRT on B777-300ER May 9 2012. Aircraft leased from Jet Airways. Waited with a large group of people checking in for various flights. Used the kiosk to print boarding pass and select seat. Upon check-in had both my bags weighed and was told one was overweight. I was moving back to Canada after 5 years in Thailand so not surprising I had accumulated many items. Check-in agent waited patiently while I redistributed luggage and moved items to carry-on. Received boarding passes for all my flights to my final destination. Aircraft was clean and received juice and water at regular intervals. Was not given vegetarian option for breakfast probably because I didn't inform the Bangkok office of Air Canada about this though I booked it on my itinerary but had a nice omelette for breakfast. Flight left on time and had a superb AVOD system which kept me entertained for the flight. Cabin crew was professional and smiling.

Give credit where credit is due-on the 16th of December I boarded AA193 in First seat 3E to connect in JFK to AA1416 to BDA also in First seat 3E. Due to a technical fault we had about an hour delay in BOS and I was concerned that I (and my fellow connecting passengers) would miss our connections. The captain did his best to make up time and after arriving at the gate (12) the lead flight attendant asked passengers not connecting to remain seated and let passengers with connections to disembark first. My BDA flight was at gate 40 and I made the fligh t- with moments to spare! Upon arriving in BDA was very surprised to see that my 2 bags had also made it.

AKL-LAX-AKL in September. Economy class outward and Business Class inward. My high rating reflects the stellar service and quality of the product in Business class its on a different planet to Economy Class. I snared an exit row seat at a $75 premium on the outward journey. There was plenty of leg room but the width of the seats seems like it is decreasing every time I'm on one of their 777-300's. Luckily I was on good terms with my neighbour. The night time trip down to the toilets is a nightmare having to manoeuvre your way through this obstacle course of legs blankets headphone cables in the aisles. I dread the day when the 747-400s are retired and the 777-300s are the only way to get to the US. Returning home in business class you were in a different world luxury space and privacy is the epitome of what this award winning airline does very well. The only thing that drops this review from a 10 to a 9 was the fiasco at LAX just before the plane departed when the ground crew decided everyone needed to have their cabin baggage weighed. It was a fiasco and yes I agree cabin baggage size and quantity needs to be monitored closely but the manner in which this exercise was performed at the departure gate in particular by one of the two ground staff it really was unprofessional.,Promoter

The soft touches of SIA being premium such as haagen daaz ice cream, food menus, biz class toiletries pouch or previous-palatable local food in economy have been discarded for margins and this is where I feel SIA have lost their direction/plot.

Just completed a series of three flights back to back. The flight attendants and all other aspects of the flight were passable but with that said that's as far as it seems to go. United has gotten me back to and from in one piece but nothing from my 10 hour journey with them in a single day has been impressionable which brings me to conclude that perhaps that's all this airline is trying to achieve unlike some of its peers. Back and forth from Los Angeles to Austin I was able to get some rest and the buy on board food purchase wasn't half bad. The flight attendants on most of my flights were much younger than the usual veteran crew that I encounter on their flights therefore enthusiastic. At the end of the day United may not be my first choice but it gets me there.,Passive
AY840 LHR-HEL Business Class and AY81 HEL-SIN Economy. The first leg from Heathrow to Helsinki on their intra- European Business Class product was flawless. The aircraft used was a modern Airbus A320. From start to finish every aspect of the journey was top class. Finnair shares the Business Class lounge at Heathrow Terminal 3 with its Oneworld partner Cathay Pacific. The lounge was comfortable with a decent offering of food and a generous offering of alcoholic spirits wine and beer. Boarding was announced in the lounge and by the time I arrived at the gate most passengers had boarded and there was no long queue. No hassle from check in to boarding. Finnair ground crew were brilliant! Flight departed on time. Intra-European Business Class uses the same seats as in economy but with the middle row empty for more space and privacy. The flight attendant in charge of the Business cabin was very attentive and went above and beyond to make passengers comfortable. Dinner was served efficiently although there was only one meal option for Business Class. It was rather odd to find a curry being served in Business Class on an intra-European flight but overall the smoked meats and champagne compensated for this. The crew accommodated passengers who could not eat curry by allowing them to choose meals from the Economy menu. A fine selection of liquors along with coffee and tea service followed dinner. The crew kept refreshing drinks throughout. Arrived in Helsinki on time. Used to flying on Finnair intra-European economy product where it feels more like a budget carrier so it was very refreshing to have such high quality service on their Business Class product. AY 81 HEL-SIN Economy: Had a 2.5 hour layover at Helsinki and used their non-Schengen lounge. It was spacious with light food and snacks and an extensive range of alcoholic and soft drinks. The lounge got a bit crowded after 10 pm with several high capacity flights departing for the Far East at the same time. Could not get an upgrade on this sector. Aircraft used was the ex-Air France Airbus A340-300 (OH-LQG) with its wonderfully dated interior which always brings back fond memories of the 1990s and early 2000s. I've flown on this an OH-LQF many times before and contrary to other reviews I find this aircraft to be up to par. IFC worked properly and there was a decent selection of movies and television shows to keep me occupied on the 11.5 hour flight. The cabin crew were not Finnish but were mostly from Singapore as I came to learn. They were highly attentive and professional always coming around the with water throughout. Meals were a lot better than previously experienced. Seat was very comfortable and the flight arrived in SIN way ahead of schedule. For the amount paid for this flight I got excellent value for money.,Promoter
Pleasantly surprised when flying from Madrid to Casablanca. Boarded 45 minutes before scheduled-take off seat 18A is recommended (exit row = loads of legroom) and landed 40 minutes early.

"âŒ   Chicago to Seattle. Our flight was scheduled for 8:10 pm on Wednesday night 5/30, originally but then was delayed 4 different times, 9:00, 10:00, 10:30, and finally was scheduled to depart 11:35 pm. Which I can live with and understand except that my girlfriend and I were sitting in the airport over 5 hours watching other planes takeoff. So we sat patiently for 5 hours and finally began boarding at 11:00 pm. American boarded the entire plane and was ready for take off, but then decided to cancel the flight at 11:47 which was after the rescheduled departure time. Then the earliest flight they could get me was in 24 hrs basically causing me to cancel my entire 3 day trip. Plus they didn't even give out hotel vouchers but instead offered cots to sleep on in the airport! I'm just really disappointed in the deception and lack of customer service/ courtesy. Airlines are allowed to do whatever they want and nothing is ever done about it, that's wrong. Treat customers better that's all we ask!",Detractor
Los Angles to Tocumen and back and was completely satisfied. The 737's were in top shape inside and out. Food was typical airline fare but the service was excellent.

I will definitely use them again.,Promoter
" Worst airline experience ever. Flying from Cozumel thru Atlanta on 4/15/18. Our connecting flight in ATL was delayed due to a scheduling error by the airline. Once that was resolved we got on the plane, but were again delayed. We sat on the tarmac for 2 hrs before the plane returned to the gate due to a mechanical error. By now it was nearly midnight. Our flight was originally supposed to leave at 9:15 pm. We were then told no flight was available til 7:00 am the next day and we'd be given hotel vouchers, but would need to be back at the airport by 5:00 am. The line to get the vouchers had several hundred people in it because Delta had screwed up other flights that night and stretched practically outside the bldg. it took several hours to get through the line (because Delta only had 3 people working the desk) which meant that by the time most passengers got the vouchers it was too late to go to the hotel. In addition, we were told that we could get a later flight but needed to call Delta. When we did, we were told hold times were over 2 hours! The vast majority of passengers ended up having to sleep in the airport. Total incompetence by Delta in every way. The few staff that were on hand were impatient and rude. I will never fly this airline again.",Detractor
" This flight from Dallas to Philadelphia is notorious for its delay and not respecting the time of people. I think they are understaffed and have arguments and change it in time with different arguments. The most annoying thing is their announcement of delays. They keep changing the time every hour with different arguments. It shows clearly their inability to say the truth. I flew with them five times and four times I had delays of over 4 to 5 hours. They disrespect the time of people because they have no competition in some major cities. I would never recommend American Airlines. I would never book them anymore, I would rather book a connecting flight to avoid them.",Detractor

Flew Toronto to Dublin on May 3rd. Booked emergency row 28 for extra legroom which was well worth it - however it was extremely cold in this row for the entire flight. Choice of 2 meals-chicken or pasta for dinner and banana bread and a coffee for breakfast. Rented an I pad for in flight entertainment and it was fine. Crew were OK- nothing sensational or terrible. Offering duty free 25 minutes before landing was somewhat late. Flight smooth and on-time but it is an older 767 and I would no fly Rouge unless I had the extra legroom I paid for ($90.)

The inflight entertainment was good and kept our toddler happy. The food was also good. Our Vancouver to Taipei flight was with a 747 so the seats were a little narrow and less roomy but I think that's to be expected with older 747s.

SAN-ORD-ROC and BUF-ORD-SAN. I decided to fly paid first as the cost when booking only a few weeks out was only slightly more than economy. I've flown AA first domestically many times so didn't expect much but flying so early in the morning it was nice to have a slightly larger seat to sleep. I'm only writing this review to point out what a drastic turn for the worse after the merger. The food quality while on domestic F is never great has always been better than the rest on AA. It is now absolutely disgusting. The one positive is that first is now offered on American Eagle - a very minor improvement of course for a flight so short in duration. I really hope management wakes up and realizes that they are ruining what was a much better than average airline.,Passive

Service on airport was good, important you save the immigration ticket you receive on arrival, you need to give this when you board the airplane on return. Absolutely everything have been smooth, and its important to keep eye on monitors. Terminal 2 is small, so in case of gate change you dont need more than 5 minute from end to other end.

" Beijing to Istanbul in August 2018. On just our second day abroad, my wife called me to tell me that we had lost my mother. She was being cared for but suddenly her health deteriorated further. Naturally I had to go home as soon as possible, we had to cancel our trip. My son, who had lost his grandmother had to deal with the customer service employee who was unempathetic and dismissive. We wanted to change our return tickets which was from Hong Kong to Istanbul on Sunday and asked them to change it to Beijing to Istanbul on Wednesday. We were told by the Turkish Airlines representative we had to pay the price of a new ticket because our ticket was no-change, but we could get the refund after we present them with the death certificate of my late mother. We had to take this option as we had to be there on time for my mothers funeral. When I went to the Turkish Airlines office in Turkey after 10 days, they told me I cannot get a refund because I already used my ticket. I told them this is what the customer service told me, and the reply is ""There is nothing we can do"". But it was the Turkish Airlines representative who persuaded us not to cancel our flights and change them instead. Turkish Airlines deliberately gave us false information on this subject and lied to us for the price of two tickets!

KL 1131 / 1128 AMS-CPH and CPH-AMS. 23/12 and 26/12. Although I'm a Flying Blue member I do travel with other airlines so I think I can assess KLM position to other benchmarks. I am actually quite satisfied with KLM. Service is above average too often it's the passenger being rude. Food is ok not better not worse it's an airplane after all. Personally I think KLM is ahead of many competitors when it comes to online check in and self-service luggage drop-off (at least at their home-base AMS) it's far more advanced and smooth than most airlines. Although my last flight was in a 737 without entertainment I know that their entire long-haul fleet now has proper personal entertainment systems so that's good. They were a bit late on their 747s though. I will use them in the future. It's important to distinguish what you can attribute to an airline and what to an airport or worse your own behavior.,Promoter

"Terrible experience seats are very small and crammed in. Pretty much same as Sunwing layout but seats are more uncomfortable. No TV screens you have to bring your own iPad apparently to access movies (and sit it on your lap or table tray - did not try this out but hear it did not work well). On way back to Toronto from Orlando (flight 1863 Sunday April 20th) there was a 10 hour flight delay due to mechanical problems. So instead of arriving home at 1pm we got home at midnight. I can understand weather delays or other emergency delays but this was ridiculous. The part they were missing was originally ""a small thing that should be fixed in 30 mins"" then that turned into another hour then another 2 hours then another 7 hours. I'm sure they knew at the start it would be a 10 hr delay - and had we been told we could have left airport and spent day at Universal Studios with our friends instead of hanging around airport. My hunch is that given the planes are older the delays are not unusual. One good thing: The staff were friendly.

" Charlotte to London Heathrow. I was so disappointed in my experience with American Airlines. I just returned from a flight on Delta and it was a far and away better experience than with AA. The difference was night and day. On both my flights to and from London, the crew never cracked a smile, never had a welcoming word, never answered a request for service with an agreeable attitude. They obviously didn't want to be dealing with the customers and were, at times, even sarcastic to their passengers. My touch screen didn't work but I didn't dare ask the attendants for assistance and get a snarky answer. The food was marginal, at best, but it was the attitude of the crew that spoiled the travel. The gate crew on Charlotte even mocked the passengers from the preceding flight within hearing of the waiting passengers. No wonder my flights were not full. Unless I have to choose American Airlines in the future, I will be flying anyone else. They got us there safely, but that was the extent of the service.",Detractor

"Easy check-in, nice lounge, fine service, was out of T2 in Mexico city within 10 minutes of landing which was great! The problem with Aeromexico is the inconsistency of the flying experience. Sometimes staff are friendly and sometimes just plain rude. Some planes have great tv entertainment and others still have overhead cabin screens with vhs video that is terrible. The worse part is the reliability of Aeromexico flights which often arrive late into Mexico city and is always blamed on too much traffic. Then do something about it! I struggle how the airline can call itself a full service airline when it discriminates against vegetarian passengers- you can never place a special meal request when purchasing your ticket but you have to remember to phone and make a special request. With every other global airline, requesting a special meal isnt a problem but with Aeromexico, on shorter flights its even worse. There is a ham and cheese sandwich or nothing! Why can't the airline simply offer a cheese sandwich to all and stop discriminating? Aeromexico is better than its competition",Passive

LHR-SIN. Check-in agent was extremely helpful - even though I was travelling on a reward ticket issued by TACA and booked through Avianca (a tortuous provenance one would expect to preclude changes) I asked at check-in if I could take the later 2230 flight instead of the 2100 I was booked on so I could get more work done in the lounge before the flight (and also as I prefer A380 to 777-300ER). Not only did he manage to do this but having done so he realised my bag had already been tagged and sent down the chute so printed a new tag gave me my travel documents then raced off to intercept my bag and re-tag it somewhere in the bowels of T3. Amazing effort (and obviously successful as my bag indeed made it on the right flight). SAS lounge pretty good nice view of the airfield action. Onboard SQ were using the hi-J config A380 with business class taking up the entire upper deck. My window seat was the last row and on it's own between the rear exit just ahead and the galley just behind. Service was very nice as usual from SQ and again dispelled the myth that they are smiling robots as I had several nice conversations with different members of the crew. Food was a bit of a letdown (seafood and rice dish very bland) but the bed is so good it's almost too comfortable - I slept so well that I had awful jetlag for a week arriving at 6pm incredibly refreshed left me hideously out of synch with the local time zone.

"â Unverified | The flight was a night flight from Shanghai to Sydney. The cabin was cold throughout the whole flight. Seated in seat 70H at the rear of the plane I asked the cabin crew (both male/female) to please turn up the heating as everyone with the exception of two male western passengers had their coats on. It was freezing. Both crew members said the heating was up to 26 degrees and this has been pre-set. I exclaimed that if this was the case, why are all the passengers sitting with their coats on. I asked both of the cabin crew to ask the flight service director to pop down to see me. I was told by both that she was too busy attending to passengers in First Class. When we got off the flight in Sydney, the flight service director was saying good-bye to disembarking passengers. When I told her my plight, she proceeded to follow me up the aerobridge apologising for this oversight. She told me that no one had brought this matter to her attention. While she appeared to be very apologetic, I can honestly say that I didn't see her once coming through the cabin in economy class. People are not comfortable sitting in their seats with their coats on. I used two spare blankets to keep me warm throughout the flight. The food was below basic with the same meals served on the way up, served on the way down. The bread roll was served after the meal and not with the meal, which was a bit odd. The in-flight entertainment (IFE) was abysmal and I was told I could not use my iPhone (which was on flight mode) to listen to my music, while the Chinese passengers were using theirs. This was my second time in flying China Eastern (the last trip in 2006 on a flight from Shanghai to HK) and it will be my last. The cabin crew do not appear to have the social or cultural niceties to satisfy their customers' expectations and comfort. Another thing, we did not hear from the captain once on any of the China Eastern flight sectors. Amazing for any airline that the captains of China Eastern do not introduce themselves or give you flight updates which are left to the staff.

" Newark to Myrtle Beach. Once again, United Airlines has caused a problem. Not only did we have a nightmare experience on the out flight from MYR to Newark, the return flight experience was a nightmare as well.

Even tho they were there when they needed to be. The check in process took so long, along with the security check thru process, that caused a major delay in there progress. Not only did they miss there flight, but now they have to wait until the following day, to experience this terror again. How is it that a major commercial airline, only has 1 flight a day. How is it that a multi billion dollar company, cannot take action, to get 2 minor children in a different flight. Instead, they make them travel back, a 2 hour travel, to do it again. First off, the ""Unaccompanied Minor"" charge is fraud. When booking these tickets, the website said nothing about added fees. The tickets were bought and paid for, and while attempting to do the check in process, United Airlines slams people with added fees. On the day of a flight. That is not ok. I get a voucher for our initial troubles (which We were under the assumption that could be used for the return flight fees) and got denied that as well. A $150 ticket, turned well over 400 dollars by the time this was said and done. Only for my children to miss a return flight, due to the faulty set up of United Airlines .",Detractor

My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,Promoter
" Chiang Mai to Frankfurt via Bangkok. Our dog can be temperamental with strangers, so it was critical for us to bring her as excess baggage on our flight when we were relocating from Thailand to Portugal. When we booked our flights, the booking agent at the Thai Airways Corporate offices told us that a dog up to 40kg (animal and crate) would be $750 USD to transport her as excess baggage to Europe. The agent's quote was consistent with the Thai Airways Pet Travel policy found on their website. We arrived at Chiang Mai International Airport on Christmas Day with Tam, and all of our belongings approximately 2Â½ hours before our flight. We provided the ticketing agent with the printed reservation confirmation (including all of the updates) that had been provided to us by the booking agent at the Corporate Offices. When we checked in, we had other issues regarding our baggage and associated fees but that is secondary to what followed. We loaded Tam (crate and all) onto the luggage scale and the total weight was 39.8 kg. Shortly thereafter, the ticketing agent told us that Tam could not travel with us on our flight because she was over 32kg. This was in direct contradiction to what the Thai Airways website says, as well as our reservation confirmation that we made in person at Thai Airways Corporate office in Chiang Mai. There we stood at the Thai Airways counter on Christmas day, after months of preparation, checking and double-checking that we had complied with all of the travel and export requirements, ensuring that the 40kg. weight limit was allowed and documented on our booking confirmation, in total disbelief. We spent 2 hours at the ticketing counter dealing with an agent who seemed entirely indifferent about the circumstances. The only explanation that she was able to provide was â€œBangkok not acceptâ€. We had to ask for a supervisor and eventually the highest person in charge for Thai Airways at the airport. After speaking with the Supervisor and being told once again that Tam could not fly with us, the Duty Manager eventually came down and told us that the booking agent in the Corporate Offices should not have made the reservation for our dog. On 2 January, I sent a lengthy email to three Directors at Thai Airways describing our experience. Several days later I received an email confirmation from Thai Airways Customer Relations Dept. that they received my email and would be conducting an investigation into our situation. On 10 January, I sent a follow-up email about our case. On 12 January I received an email from the Chief of the Customer Relations Svc. Dept. regarding the investigation that they completed on our case. In the Chief's response, she acknowledged that Thai Airways Staff at CNX was in the wrong and should have accepted our dog on our flight, but she indicated that because we were given additional baggage allowance (as a gesture of goodwill) that there was nothing further Thai Airways would do for us. On 12 January another email was directed to Customer Relations, the Chief, Directors and VP's. In it I expressed that while we appreciated the gesture, including the additional bags was a soft cost to Thai Airways and that it surely did not compensate for their error. I also highlighted that bringing Tam on our flight as excess baggage was the single most important factor in selecting Thai Airways. As 01/18 I have heard nothing further from Thai Airways.",Detractor
" Sydney to Newark via Houston. I was happy to book and fly with them because they use the Boeing 787 aircraft on the 14 hour flight to Houston. As an airline, they weren't amazing, but they were fine. The food was fine, nothing to write home about, and the entertainment was okay, a few too many â€˜old' movies for my liking. The flight attendants were old and a bit abrupt, not overly friendly but not rude. I did notice the seats did not recline back very far, which was not ideal on a flight you have to sleep on. Luckily the middle seat in our row was free so we could spread out a little. Both flights left on time. Would I fly United again? It wouldn't be my first choice, but I wouldn't rule it out.",Passive
DOH-HKG Airbus 330-300. Business Class. It is many years since I was a Diamond member of Cathay this is my first flight with them for nearly 15 years.

No sleepwear like Qatar. The juice is carton not fresh. Overall although a safe trip not worth the money they charge.,Passive

" Tokyo Narita to Hobbs via Houston. I traveled alone with my 10 month old daughter both ways. No flight attendant helped me out in any way like putting luggage up in the cabin, picking up her toys for me, or even just being friendly. Everyone treated me like I was a hassle to deal with. One attendant refused to give me my bassinet because service had started, even though I had already been waiting for an hour. It only takes a few seconds to latch it on. One flight attendant actually made eye contact with my smiley daughter and waved, which was nice. One Japanese male attendant who I spoke to in Japanese, replied to me in English even though (he was speaking Japanese to the other staff so) I know he spoke Japanese. Why not speak back to me in Japanese? That is just plain rude. Other than that, after experiencing JAL last year, I thought the food was extremely disappointing. I also specifically made a phone call just to request a bassinet, but when I went to check in, there was no such request. I was baffled. I can't say how disappointed and annoyed I was about the staff on both flights. If you are traveling alone with an infant, they will treat you like an inconvenience.",Detractor
We took a flight from Manchester to Toronto on the B767. After reading the reviews on here before I left I expected the worst. I am over 6 ft tall and so asked at check in whether they had any extra leg room seats available. They did and I was placed there free of charge. Once on board I found the seat was a bulkhead by an emergency exit so although I couldn't stretch my legs straight there was more space than other seats. My friends hadn't requested extra legroom so we're sat further back in the plane. I went and joined them for a small time (plane was half empty) and the space was no where near as bad as made out on here. Ok space is tight but the cabin felt open and refreshed. Food and service was ok but felt they were a bit stingy with the drinks (only serve soft drinks and only brought round twice) plus no water served in between. Having said all of this I wouldn't like to fly on here should it be a full flight so would try not to use them again unless it was the only option.,Passive
Cape Town-Doha-New York and return: Excellent experience all-round. Charming and helpful cabin crew great entertainment (especially appreciate being able to view while landing). One point though: please don't run the menu for 45 minutes - 5 minutes will suffice! (Doha - CPT). Special mention of our stay over (courtesy Qatar) at Retaj Hotel Doha. Surprisingly fabulous hotel with great food added to our travel experience and even motivated plans to incorporate a visit to Doha which we had no idea was so beautiful on future travels.,Promoter
VA 752 from LAX to SFO was scheduled to depart at 11.20pm but was delayed because the clouds were below 2000ft which it can't so SFO close the airport. Departure was pushed back to 12.30pm and Virgin did not inform us until we reached the gate. We boarded the plane finally and right back into the delay segment again same problem with SFO. However the captain and the crew was excellent and displayed true professionalism and great service. Captain went about and personally informed passengers of the problem and the FA made jokes which cheered us up. Delays continued as we sat on the tarmac for another 1 hr before we finally took off at 3.20pm.

The airline does not communicate with its customers at all if flights are changed, and in my opinion, are extremely incompetent. Flew from Kona to Phoenix expecting an hour layover to Portland and when we land, we find out it's been changed to 4 hours. Mind you, a 6 hour flight with a screaming 1 year old plus being dragged through a 45 min process just to check bags because computers froze and then employees almost tagged our bags with the wrong tags.

Check-in in Toronto was OK no fast track was apparent although it was purportedly offered. Lounge in YYZ was nice pre-flight dinner was just about OK with modest quality wines offered. Chose an Aisle seat YYZ-LHR bad idea. Seats are incredibly narrow not quite wide enough for my shoulders. Tried to sleep but not possible with in-flight staff constantly leaning across me lowering the partition and speaking to the Window Seat passenger who appeared to be a BA staff member who was determined to drink all night. Didn't eat dinner but breakfast was adequate. Decided on a window seat for the return LHR-YYZ. Bad idea again! Very claustrophobic. During the entire flight I managed to get one small glass of champagne it was very good. Thereafter no matter how many times I pressed my call button no one came thus nothing more to drink other than a glass of red wine with my dinner. No offers of cognac or liqueurs. Dinner ingredients were clearly good and well chosen but everything was so overcooked it was inedible. When I say over-cooked I mean grey vegetables that disintegrated on your fork and meat that was so dry and stringy that it was actually really unpleasant. Hadn't flown BA for a number of years and being a Brit thought it would be a pleasant change from Air Canada on this route. It was a change but not a pleasant one. It's back to AC for me. Their business class is way better than this experience. Perhaps I was just unfortunate.

"  Heathrow to Doha on a Boeing 777, I thought the legroom and comfort of the seat on this sector was very good, I had plenty of room, the food and beverage was of a high standard, crew were very professional and nice. Before take-off they asked me if I'd flown with Qatar Airways before which I hadn't so they then took the time to explain how the on-board service works, (you can order whatever you want from the menu to be served at any time you like). I got some sleep on the overnight sector to Doha and was impressed by the experience, I wasn't as impressed with the A330 that operates the Doha to Phuket sectors, I'm of average build but I found the seat to be very narrow when in bed mode and couldn't sleep. Food and beverage immaculately presented and of a high standard, entertainment system easy to use and good content. Final sector Doha to Heathrow upper deck on the A380, single seat, configuration 1-2-1 really comfortable seat/bed with plenty of personal storage space. I'm not sure why Qatar Airways bother with the bar at the back of the business class cabin on this aircraft as I only saw one person using it. The lounge at Doha is okay but didn't blow me away as expected from reading various reviews, it was very busy both times I was there and I found it to be quite soulless and uninteresting.

I booked a fairly priced return ticket between Dublin and Edinburgh in May 2015. The experience was horrible. I think the check-in and baggage drop works okay as long as you only have hand luggage and a European or UK passport. If you need to check in a bag or you require a visa it's absolute chaos. There is no clear signage the staff keeps directing you to a different queue that already has at least 50 people waiting. This was the closest I've ever come to missing a flight. The price of my ticket increased threefold with the bag I checked in (less than 20kg btw) and they even charge 15 euro to print your boarding pass. This borders on criminal if you ask me.

Check in was fast since I was connecting in Amsterdam from a flight from Brussels. The aircraft was a 767 in a 2-3-2 layout. The pitch was average in the 31-32 inches and seats ok for economy.

"Air Canada Rouge from Toronto to Barbados on May 12th. The worst flight of my life! I am only 5'2"" and I have to say it was tight for me. The seats recline about 4 inches in total. When the person in front of my seat reclined the back of the seat was in my face! I felt sorry for the fellow in the window seat who was over 6' tall. I really don't know how he managed for the 5hr plus flight. His legs were stretched out the entire time so that he could fit into the seat. 2 guys behind me were hacking and coughing for the entire flight (not the fault of Rouge - but they should have worn masks or not be allowed on the plane). The staff was great and were cheerful throughout the entire flight. The overhead luggage bins are smaller than those on other planes. Then I discovered one of the reasons the bin space was further limited was that the crew had at least 3 of their bags in the bins so the paying customers had even less space for their items. I hope that reviews like this will be taken into consideration and that Rouge is not used on flights to Barbados. Also the seats were hard and uncomfortable. For 2 days since the flight my back and neck have been in a terrible state. I will not fly Air Canada again between Barbados and Toronto until more comfortable planes are in use.",Detractor
This airline gave me what I was looking for - an inexpensive way to get me from point A to point B. Due to maintenance problems we were held up for 4 hrs but that tells me they're more concerned with their safety record than their on-time record. They gave a voucher for a meal at the terminal. The seats were fairly close together but not horribly so. The desk staff and flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Good solid flight with a worthy aircraft.

"  Never again! Booked a round trip from to London from Paris return with British Airways in business as had a separate ticket from Paris to Johannesburg (with AF in business class) and Cape Town to Paris (with Qatar in business class). On the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in London T5. Checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which I found strange being a business class passenger. The reason I chose the BA flight was that it was from the same airport (CDG) as where my flight from Cape Town via Doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing I wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to London. The plan was to get refreshed in the lounge, rest for few hours and get on the flight. Unfortunately, my plans were trashed when I arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that I had been rebooked from Orly (which is an hour away). It didn't stop there, no transfer was provided and when asked how do I get there, the unfriendly reply was ""well, get a bus"". No indication of where. The woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague. Tried to get some more information to which the reply was ""go online"". She gave me a paper which I thought would be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to get compensation. Thought ok, at least something. The next shock, when I arrived in Orly. The check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy! As I was very tired and just wanted to get home, agreed but asked if could still use the lounge. Oh no, not possible! At this point I was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager. Was told that it was not possible and that I could go online and complain. Gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again. Spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating ""go online, I don't care about BA"". When back home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight. Complained again as had the paper from the CDG ground crew about compensation. Generic reply after 5 minutes was, no compensation. Needless to say, I will never fly with BA again which is a shame as do like other oneworld partners who I frequently fly with in business class and am a FF (luckily not of BA).",Detractor
"  I was flying Zurich to Baltimore via London with my cello and had booked one seat for me and an extra seat for the cello. The booking was made online and then verified over the phone directly with British Airways. I asked the BA customer support agent if the cello booking would be okay, and he told me ""there is no problem - you have the additional seat booked, simply turn up at check-in and you will have no problems"". BA denied me boarding because their system required not only me, but also the cello seat needs to have an ESTA visa! They were unable to distinguish between a passenger and a cello in their system. After 3 hours of stress at check-in they denied me boarding and quoted me over $4,000 to rebook both tickets for all legs of the journey. I made an official complaint and they replied basically confirming no refund. I am appalled my their total lack of customer service and will never fly with them again.",Detractor
"My flight to Europe Houston to Brussels via Amsterdam with KLM was simply delightful, the seating upstairs, the meal, service on board and the shorter flight time were all perfect. Due to the strong tail winds we arrived in Europe an hour ahead of schedule, the seating was confortable especially the window seats as they allow for one to stick long legs (like mine) some what diagonal towards the cabin wall. The meal was served immediately after take off, the beef bourguignon was outstanding, it was paired with a very delicious red Spanish wine. The cabin crew was the absolute best part of this flight, so attentive without being overbearing, Always with a smile making you feel welcome. I got to sleep at least three hours and arrived well rested. In Amsterdam I visited the lounge on the Schengen side, I was somewhat hungry and the breakfast available was plentiful including fried eggs. My flight got to Brussels was only 35 min but the cabin crew was able to serve a delicious sandwich and a drink. This flight too arrived on time. KLM is a great choice and I highly recommend it.",Promoter

"I am amazed that customers do not ""get"" the Spirit Airlines' philosophy of cheap flying when Spirit so clearly states what a basic ticket includes. I flew round trip from Atlanta to Ft Lauderdale back to Atlanta in the midst of the Christmas rush for less than $70 each way. Did I buy an extra bag at extra cost? No. Did I check in on line and print my ticket at home to avoid the advertised extra cost? Yes. Did I buy snacks and beverages once on board? No! I read the literature and packed a snack from home. Because the seats don't recline (and put the passenger in front of me in my lap) and because the seats don't have extra padding that takes up extra space, I was able to fully extend my legs under the seat in front of me. I was no more uncomfortable than I am on any airline, and even if I was, I would just smile at the money I saved. Spirit tells you what it takes to fly cheaply. You can certainly do so if you read and follow Spirit's directions. The choice is yours.",Promoter

The online booking experience was straightforward: what you agree to is what you got, no deviations.

The seating is really tight (I'm barely 5' tall on a good day, and I felt scrunched with minimal leg room)",Promoter
" Toronto to St. Lucia. Our flight to St. Lucia was supposed to leave at 11 am. The flight was delayed due to mechanical issues with no updated departure time given. Sunwing offered food vouchers for the food court which was nice but there was probably 300 or more people on the flight. We all had to line up to get these vouchers from the few Sunwing staff that were working. They then told us the flight would be delayed until 10:30 pm that night. They offered hotel vouchers for those who came from out of town. Again we had to wait in line for these. It was pure chaos. None of the staff seemed to know what was going on or how to deal with the situation. This delay threw off the entire beginning of our trip. We were exhausted after being up for 24 hours straight and we missed an entire night at our resort. Sunwing did offer us $200 vouchers for the inconvenience but when we went to use these we found out they had to convert them to USD and that we could only use 65% of it towards an excursion on our trip. The plane we flew back on was dirty, the AC stopped working at one point, the seatbelt lights and reading lights did not work at all and we were not offered a meal even though the flight was over dinner time. I have no idea how this airline is still in business and I will never fly with them again. Spend a little more money and fly with another airline!",Detractor
DUB-RIX-TLL. Great service friendly staff hassle free transfer through Riga even with a very tight connection (35 minutes) and all for 76 euro. As with other budget carriers if you read the small print and ensure that cabin/checked baggage meets requirements there should be no complaints. As a regular traveller on the Dublin to Tallinn route I have tried lots of airlines and flight combinations and will definitely use Air Baltic in the future. My only complaint is that the Riga flight leaves (a deserted) Dublin airport at 01.15!,Promoter
Our family of five adults recently traveled from Los Angeles (LAX) to IST to DAR and back. The new lounge in IST is gorgeous! The LAX-IST legs were excellent: comfortable seats attentive staff good food. The IST-DAR legs were only fair: seat controls didn't work staff was less than attentive food was mediocre. But the biggest problem we had was with the online reservation system. Even though I had printouts of the electronic tickets the system kept saying we had not booked and did not allow me to check in. Worse than that the ground personnel had a lot of trouble checking us in. By using the electronic ticket numbers (and not the confirmation code which said our reservations didn't exist) the agent could see our reservation but not check us in or print out boarding passes. Very frustrating! Finally they figured out a work-around and we were able to board.,Passive

Sunday flight 19.00 17/8. I dread going home with Aer Lingus as there is usually a scrum to get on the plane as the regulars do not understand the meaning of the word queue and the staff don't control the amount of luggage each passenger takes onboard leading to the ritual scratching of heads when their oversized hand luggage doesn't fit in the overhead locker and delay as bags have to be stowed. Why does this continue? When eventually the passengers were on board (it takes forever as many cant count) we then had to listen to the captain boasting about how he was going to get us there early - of course he didn't. Cut the showing off - control the passengers hand luggage and teach them and the staff some manners. Far too expensive for this nonsense - get professional.,Detractor

Having travelled extensively on different airlines to Europe, USA, Far East, I think I'm adequately qualified to to complain about the lack of courtesy meted out by Emirates staff. They appeared to be a disgruntled lot who found it difficult to even crack a smile. A male attendant was particularly impatient with passengers asking for any service. Even though my husband is a platinum skywards member, I don't think I will be booking on this airline anytime soon. Every passenger, economy to first class deserves the same respect.",Detractor
" Miami to Atlanta. Dont Ever fly with them. They lied to us on the phone when we called prior to our flight saying we would be able to keep our return flight if we chose to purchase a flight earlier than the original one. The day we went to check in they said they had cancelled our flight, wouldn't give refund, said we lied about ever calling. We have proof that we called. Said they wouldnt help us that the basic economy doesn't work like that. We followed their rules to a T and called prior to make sure and then told the day it was cancelled that we cant miss the first flight, although again it was approved ahead of time. They didn't even act caring, had to wait extreme times on the phone to talk to anyone. No one was helpful or even admitted they cancelled it, kept blaming someone else.

Hopefully other Ryanair crews are up to that excellent standard. We will certainly use you again after this service, and I just hope it wasn't a one off.",Promoter
I agree with others that it is ridiculous not to be able to check in for a return flight if it is more than 7 days. I had to get up at 5.30am this morning to do so or pay the fine.

I had the pleasure of the new A380 flying LAX-ICN connecting to an A330 for ICN-BKK. I was upstairs in Travel Class (Economy) and would have to rate the experience as the best of all my Economy Class flights over a million miles of travel. The new design seats are plenty comfortable enough especially when the redesign generated another inch or so of legroom (via thinner back cushioning). The crew was the usual Asiana well-oiled and very attentive machine and everything went off without the slightest hitch. The in-flight entertainment is presented on a beautiful 10-inch touch screen but it could have benefited from a broader range of offerings as is found on Cathay Pacific Singapore Airlines and other competitors in the region. It is a minor complaint though given the amazing quiet and smoothness of the A380 ride. Asiana has long been a favorite carrier of mine and the most recent experience only reinforced it.,Promoter
"This is the first time we have flown with Etihad Airways and it will be the last. Manchester to Phuket in March, returning 20th June. Both times transferring in Abu Dhabi. Not impressed with either the airline or Abu Dhabi Airport. Our transfer time outbound was 1.5hrs. Very long taxiway, then bus to the terminal. After passing through security ""last call"" was being announced for our flight to Phuket. And we still had to run from T1 to T3. Somewhat better on the return trip, with just over 3 hours transfer time. At the time of booking our flights we were informed that it would be A330s all the way. But 3 of the 4 flights were changed to Boeing 777's, one of them without informing us. Seating on the aeroplanes was not good - cramped, not much leg room. Cabin crew were not at all friendly, in fact, rather surly. Food was far from good, in fact inedible. The only thing we can't complain about - no delays - all flights either on time or early. However, on arrival back in Manchester 1 suitcase did not arrive. At least 4 or 5 other passengers from the same flight experienced the same thing. In fact one told us that he had flown with Etihad 3 times in the last 2 weeks - each time at least 1 bag was delayed. I can update progress, having just rung Etihad, the lost bag arrived on this morning's flight. Will hopefully arrive by courier later today.

I travelled YYZ-SAN on April 1. The restrictive seat pitch on Air Canada Rouge A-319 is intolerable for a flight exceeding 5.5 hours. The operation of the flight was problematic. No reason or apology was offered for our 25-minute late arrival in San Diego. If it was due to adverse weather en route this must have been known to the flight crew prior to our departure from YYZ and appropriate measures taken. The flight was fully boarded and doors closed 10 minutes before scheduled departure time (6.05pm). Nonetheless the aircraft was held at the gate until 6.05pm and then started a lengthy taxi to the runway where it was delayed again to await two general aviation arrivals.

Seven hours on a seat like this and you come out with leg and back pain. I had to keep my hands stack on my body as there was no space to rest them. Do not bother paying for the extra legroom seats as these are even more narrow due to the entertainment monitor stored in the armrest. Flight attendants completely uninterested and rude.

" As a frequent flyer I do a lot of hops on different airlines both within Europe and intercontinentally, and can say that the best option in Europe is now KLM due to their extensive network, frequencies and good hub in Schiphol.

I was able to purchase comfort seats online, I was able to do mobile check in via app, mobile boarding passes worked, and I had no delay at any point at all airports of my travel. Check in desks in Kiev and Dusseldorf are well staffed and provide a very smooth and competent treatment. Onboard it was all right. Clean cabins, clean toilets, cheerful staff and smart snack concept including bar service. Somehow there was no battle over overhead luggage space despite full flights. Flights out were bang on time. Flights back both delayed by 50 min due to snow, but with excellent communication from the gate staff and then from the crew. Announcements onboard about connection gates and delays are much appreciated. Overall I had around 40 flights with AirFrance/KLM within last 12 months, and can say that at any case including flight cancellations I got very responsible and reasonable treatment.

Maintenance seems poor and seats dirty as well as hard though space is good. Very poor staff service and as remotes are broken you can't call attendants - deliberate? Toilets are very dirty and we ran out of toilet tissues. Had to remind staff. No cleaning of toilets as on most other airlines. Staff are lazy. Some exceptions but did not make up for non attentiveness. Could not believe poor movie choice - latest movies were two years old and most between 5-10 years. Issued good headphones but I used my Bose and relied on my own entertainment. We usually left late and the plane system is very poor in showing estimated arrival time. Food was poor.

We decided to sit since I have put our carryons. The customer sitting next to window shows unhappy face why we sat next to him! Then the crew shows face and says we go sit somewhere else while it is non of his business where we sit. Then we found another two seats available and we go sit next to someone else. The crew shows hand and face gestures to the other passenger comes and shows attitude why we asked the other passenger to let us into the two available seats. I don't understand when they have opening seating policy the crew has any right to tell us where to sit or not and being so rude about it. My wife told him that she was unhappy with his attitude and asked his name and wished him have a good day. His response was â€œoh I am having a good day, you have a good dayâ€ with sarcasm. Totally dissatisfied with Southwest and its employee.",Detractor

" London City to Zurich, I fly this route a lot, around 8 times per year, The flight was delayed initially by an hour, I was kept up to date via the app so I was not disappointed.

"Flew Lufthansa from Bogota to Frankfurt. All announcements and services were done in German as well as English and Spanish. Dinner and breakfast were served and both were pretty tasty. The flight attendants completely skipped the coffee/tea and digestif round after dinner but did two duty free rounds instead. While Lufthansa finally has individual IFE, the selection is somewhat limited for 11 hour flights. Most movies are old and the music selection is very poor. Almost only unknown musicians are available. The flight departed and arrived on time though. Drinks were available in the galley throughout the flight, however this was never mentioned during the announcements. The seats get uncomfortable quickly and the blankets are too small.",Passive
 Atlanta to San Diego. I was just told that because my initial flight from Atlanta to San Diego was delayed so much that I wouldn't make it in time for my connecting flight.

"I had to wait until mid-December to buy American Airlines tickets for my 7 year old daughter to come to California to visit for the holidays, I didn't think I was going to be able to afford it, or find accommodating flights for the days I was hoping for. I was helped with the entire process for a very fair price considering the timing. My daughter was extremely well taken care of by the staff, and we were 100% informed and helped through the entire process. I'm grateful that everything went as well as it did, AA is my airline for her future trips.

Travelled to Madina from Manchester and returned from Jeddah to Manchester. Food was ok had the same meals on all 4 flights. Seating was OK but due to the small flights UK-Egypt sector very cramped. Worst staff seen on an airline. I am a frequent traveller and decided to use this airline as it was cheap. Staff shouting at passengers as if they are doing us a favour by providing drinks/meals. No entertainment at all not even small gifts/books for the children. Lavatory was devoid of basic amenities like a dry floor and toilet tissue. Seating was all over and in fact we were given 4 different areas of the aircraft to seat our 5 family members. Will never recommend.,Detractor
Flight from London to Miami then Miami to La Paz. By far the most disappointing flight we have had. The cabin crew were unbelievably rude disinterested and unhelpful. We've had much better service with budget airlines. Thought it was ridiculous that people could reserve seats up to one year in advance. Our flights were booked by a tour company so we were unaware of this until a few days before and therefore left with disappointing seats on the way out to our honeymoon destination.

"  Toronto to Gatwick return via Dublin. My lasting impression is that this is a no-frills airline trying to put on a show like they aren't a no-frills airline. Everything was pretty much lack lustre, but they did get us from A to B to C and back again, on time. Positives: The four planes we travelled on were clean, tidy and comfortable. Cabin crew were very friendly and professional. They've got some good and experienced people working for them. We travelled in peak season so the flights weren't cheap, but outside of that time, they are one of the cheaper long haul airlines. Terms and conditions were made very clear during booking and check in. Connection through Dublin was easy and clear if a bit convoluted. Negatives: Pre-flight customer service was poor. Booking and online check in allowed for no seat selections to be made. At no point in the booking/check in process were we able to select seats, which was important to us due to the age and health of the travellers. Only through extended negotiation with contracted check-in staff at airport, who could see our needs, were we able to secure appropriate seats. Which left for a nerve-wracking build up to travelling. Special meal selections were inaccurate from booking - luckily we called up in advance to confirm. Food on outbound leg was good, but they ran out of the chicken option very quickly. Food on the way home was terrible. Entertainment selection is okay. The technology is poor, though. Had to reset my or my companions' screens at least once on each leg. Several functions did not work. Baggage handling is poor. Had a 2.5 hour wait at Toronto for baggage to come through. One lost bag. Despite which party was at fault, it was very poor customer service from Aer Lingus from that point on, with nobody to speak to at the company, and given telephone numbers cutting out upon connection. Seemingly there is no customer service department. Very few representatives on the ground. Would travel with them again given the cost, but with low expectations.",Passive

AMS-ZRH-GRU on Jan 3 AMS-ZRH on an Airbus 320 ZRH-GRU on an Airbus 340-300 both legs in Business Class AMS-ZRH was on time FA's were friendly and attentive a simple continental breakfast was served nothing special but fine for the short hop. As with most flights in Europe seats were economy seats with the middle seat left unsold LX uses the Recaro slim seats which are rather uncomfortable but again ok for this short flight and leg room was ok. ZRH-GRU (day flight) was on-time and an excellent experience on all levels modern and clean plane (as one comes to expect from LX) with a 1-2-1/2-2-1 configuration with lie flat seats. IFE was AVOD movie selection was fine but has room for improvement. FA's were brilliant professional attentive actually charming and regularly present in the cabin with drinks sandwiches snacks ice-cream etc. Meals served were tasty and with a Swiss touch. Lunch was Salmon Tarter (and two other choices) and Swiss Sturgeon (or Beef Tenderloin or Swiss Style Chicken Breast or Vegetable Curry). The second meal was a less interesting choice of Penne or Ceasars's Salad. It always nice to be served some local tastes and not just generic airline food. Wines served were also nice including some Swiss choices. LX uses the shared Servisair lounge in AMS which although comfortable offers just an OK drinks selection and a neglectable food selection. Due to the short connection time in ZRH we did not use lounge in ZRH. Transferring in ZRH is fast and easy. Border Control was friendly and with no waiting time also no additional transfer security control for passengers arriving from other Schengen countries a breeze. Terminals are roomy and well designed. Probably one of the very best airports in Europe for a transfer connection. Excellent long-haul product by LX and clearly recommended. LX is truly the gem of the Lufthansa Group of airlines (LH 4U OS SN and LX).,Promoter
MAN-AUH-BKK in the last month. Chauffeur pick up and lounge at Manchester were excellent. Lounge in AUH was crowded. I noted that several passengers in the lounge were not travelling business class but were sprawled over the limited seating. Boarding at BKK was haphazard with no priority for premium passengers. This was my 5th trip this year with EY in Business class. I have noted some deterioration in standards but once on board this is compensated by the excellent service and meals.,Passive
"  When I booked this flight I thought I was getting a deal. This flight was booked in Dec 2015 for a departure date of 20 May from Milwaukee to Honolulu. The seats I initially selected were not provided even though I paid the bill. What a mess and a headache going on for 3 hours getting this cleared up. I did not like the method for the WiFi connection. I had to pay an additional charge just to receive a video and still no Internet connection. The use of my own device and no way to maintain power.

"Air Canada has terrible credit voucher policies. Beware when booking a ticket. In error I booked a ticket with a route error. The rules and fees to change the ticket equaled the same amount as rebooking it. Note the following: There is a change fee for each direction ($75 each direction), a name change fee ($100) and if the new ticket is less than the original ticket the difference is forfeited. Also note that a credit is good for one year from the date of booking, not the date of the flight on the actual ticket.

Travelled business class on EK434 23 Jan and EK435 26 Jan BNE-AKL-BNE (A380-800). Consistently good service on both flights with attentive crew and impressive product. Seats very comfortable and would definitely make for a pleasant long haul flight. IFE boasts extensive selection of movie/music/TV options. Bar lounge is a terrific space to stretch one's legs and socialise with others. Food a little basic for business class standards and some crew lacked wine knowledge but this didn't really impact too much on the overall experience. Our travel agent ordered a surprise cake for us to celebrate our impending marriage and the crew made a fuss even taking a Polaroid picture for us to commemorate the occasion - such a lovely gesture all round!

Lufthansa has an excellent first class product. The seat and bed comfort is excellent. Caviar is still served but the portions tend to get smaller than before.

"  Warsaw to Lisbon on a A320. Upgraded from Economy to Business using Plus grade offer in TAP in there website. We have a new twist on the TAP Airline, now the business and the economy class go together, no separation on the plane even. Welcome to a new kind of Ryanair or easyJet. Nothing there in the aircraft, normally there is a curtain but even that is gone. I normally don't do upgrades. Don't work really (on the short and medium flights (on TAP) and allow me to explain why. The aircraft has the same seats, now even the first row has lost space. You have the seat in the middle free but this is one of the few if not the only bonus). The food on TAP is just bad food. Food in economy is even worst but in Business easily you eat better in economy on Air France or Lufthansa. If you have a Gold Star alliance card (my case) why pay the upgrade. We already have, fast track, lounge etc. So really 110 Euros for 1500 Miles more is just bad business. On top of that the Business Class of TAP on short and medium flights has nothing to offer. Not even a single newspaper. They will tell you to buy an iPad an download but if don't have this - well good luck. It doesn't pay off really, the service, the food, the things they don't offer or have stopped offering during the recent years. And the critical factor - the crew look and act so many times like government tax representatives. Overhead bins in business class full of airline service material. The service, well you sit on the aircraft and the can be taking off and they will no even offer you a glass of anything. If you ask they will bring. That's all.

There was no Baggage Drop-Off counter for passengers who took the time to check-in online - even their self-check- in facility was out of order! I queued for 40 minutes. Not providing the facility at CNX whilst promoting its use is unreasonable and irrational.

"  Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong. I have previously flown Cathay Pacific long haul and regionally within Asia in business class and have nothing but praise for the whole experience. This was the first time I have flown in coach with them. My only complaint is the seat itself. It was one of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in. I was in the first row of the economy section so leg room was also partially restricted because of the bulkhead, but it also had virtually no recline and the seat back was almost like a piece of wood. The flight was almost 5 hours and was pretty uncomfortable. Not taking the bulkhead would have been better as I would have at least been able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I'm only 5' 10"" so it's not like I'm overly tall. If you do want bulkhead in the first row then select the 3 seats on the window side as they do have more legroom. Aside from the seats everything else was great. The IFE is extensive and the service and food were very good.

I asked for panadol from the crew and they were very responsive providing me with the medicine together with hot water. I had pre-ordered the in-flight meal of coconut rice and they were very kind to offer to help me change to a sandwich in order for me to eat the sandwich before taking the medicine. They came around offering me hot water from time to time. In conclusion, we really enjoyed the personalized service and value for money despite this being a budget airline.

"This was the worst experience I had with Southwest Airlines. I booked a 2 way trip for a family trip, Austin to Atlanta. The flight was delayed several times, I had booked my hotel and tickets for other shows, because of the delay of the flight I couldn't go to any place on time. My plan was completely spoiled, my vacation was terrible because of Southwest. During the return also I had the same issue, the flight was delayed again.

" Dubai to Singapore. Whatever Executive approved the 2x3x2 configuration for the Boeing 777 fleet, did Emirates a huge disservice. Will never fly the Emirates Boeing 777 again. A business class seat should not require you to ""either"" climb over the person next to you, or require the person next to you, to climb over you, to get to the aisle. Will only fly airlines whose business class cabin is 1x2x1, or offers ""direct aisle access"" from every business class seat.",Detractor

" Earlier this year, my wife and I travelled business class with BA from Dublin to Jo'burg, returning from Cape Town, thru London in each direction. Having paid business class fares, we were then quite taken aback to have to pay an additional â‚¬476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors. Had we not selected seats, we could have found ourselves not just separated, but possibly with one of us on the upper deck and one on the lower deck of the A380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight. We therefore had no choice. What sort of customer retention policy is this? No other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection, but BA just don't seem to care. It is a rip-off. The forward/rear facing business class seat plan on BA planes is really unattractive, complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat. BA should take a look at the Emirates A380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout. This was our first business class experience with BA. Having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly, we have discovered how much behind the play BA actually are.",Detractor
This is my second bad experience with Air Baltic. The first time I had a direct flight from Berlin to Vilnius and the plane was overbooked so they sent me via Warsaw so instead of 1.5 hour travel time I ended up traveling for 5 hours. Second time I had a direct ticket from Oslo to Vilnius. My flight was canceled and I was offered either a refund or a different non-direct flight in the evening instead of morning. I chose a refund and still waiting for it. The representative told me that it will take at least 6 weeks to get a refund!,Detractor

London-Prague-London. Smart new-looking A320 from T3 which was nice. Early flight so no delays ahead of the ATC cock-up that day. Good crew there and back on time and generally excellent service.

On Easyjet the trolley makes glacial progress down the aisle whereas on BA things move much more quickly.,Promoter

SFO/IAH/SJO (San Jose Costa Rica) /IAH/SFO in First on domestic Business on the international flights - 737-900 and 737-800 - pleasantly surprised by the service which was almost perfect (only 1 FA on 1 flight was rude when I was forward enough to ask about whether there would be dessert). New lounge at SFO is still pretty bad considering it's a UA hub and supposed to represent the USA to the Pacific Rim but it was adequate (although be warned the bar closes at 10.30pm sharp not so good for those of us on midnight flights). Food on 1 flight also not so great (overdone tasteless steak) but otherwise good - I think they serve starbucks coffee because it tasted so burnt I could only drink 1/3 cup even though we were going on 30+ hours with no sleep by the time we were landing in Costa Rica.

The rep at the counter was much better informed and completed our check in within a couple of minutes. This kind of disorganization caused at least one customer I talked with to miss her flight!

"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA. I understand that the A380 fitout may be better but I'll continue to avoid Emirates.",Passive
"Our scheduled flight to Baltimore was initially delayed, due to a reported air conditioning service issue, and then cancelled. As soon as the flight was cancelled on the gate placard, attendants at the gate indicated that they were unable to answer questions about alternatives because their shift was ending. They referred all of the passengers to a service area a few hundred yards away. The people at that service desk indicated that they were busy and would take hours to answer questions, and in turn referred us to another service desk that supposedly had no crowd. The second service desk was more crowded than the first but eventually got to us. They informed me that they could not get me to Baltimore that day but that they could get us to Washington and provide a shuttle to Baltimore, free of charge. We were then sent to a gate that had been double-booked. After United reassigned the gate (another cross-terminal jaunt), we learned the fight to Washington had been delayed. When we finally did arrive at Washington, the United attendants there indicated we were on our own to Baltimore. This lack of dependability, customer service, and honoring promises-based on my experience-has become a hallmark of United over the last two years. I will not fly United again, regardless of rates or schedule.",Detractor

I asked the indigo staff if my excess luggage can be adjusted with him. Staff told me to pay the extra amount. I immediately agreed to pay. Hence as per the baggage policy, I paid 400*10Kg -4000Rs. On arriving at Kochi airport after a 40-minute wait, I discovered that one of the luggage was lost and reported to the baggage claim representative. After waiting for more than 30 minutes, she cross-checked with the boarding pass and confirmed me that the bag of 10Kg is missing. I spoke to the indigo staff and have no information for me as to the whereabouts of my luggage. One of the senior officials of Indigo called me on June 9th and confirmed that the bag weight was 10Kg and a refund of 3500INR will be given. I expressed a complete dissatisfaction as I paid 4000Rs extra for the same bag. The staff promised me that he will check with the finance department and revert back. But I haven't received any call yet. I find it unprofessional how such a large airline like Indigo can lose luggage. To add insult to injury, I am faced with obtaining compensation for those items that are far less than their worth.",Detractor

We booked Air Canada because the flight times were good we collect Aeroplan and fly AC from Toronto to Calgary at least once a year. We did not know anything about Rouge and not until almost the time for our flight did we know AC had another section for hot spots. We were not concerned because we have always been happy with our service. We did not know there was no in-flight entertainment until we were on the plane. We do not use Apple products but have an Android tablet no good to us on the flight. The seats are squishy and uncomfortable. The only saving grace coming home was I had booked late flights so we just slept no other choice. When we got to our destination I went on the web to learn about Rouge. It is not easy to find anything. Next time we will go to the States and choose an American carrier. Never again Rouge.,Detractor

I must mention that the airport staff once we were notified of the delay immediately brought plenty of water and snacks to distribute to all of us that we're waiting and kept everyone informed with PA announcements and the gentleman at the desk was extremely patient answering every single question from all who came up to him. It really looks like United is trying to do the right thing. Once the aircraft arrived the flight lasted under an hour, we quickly boarded the aircraft and no time we had taken off and landed in Philadelphia. Kudos to United for a job well done!",Passive

"Our Spirit Airlines flight from Ft. Lauderdale to Port au Prince, Haiti for a mission trip was without incident although we noticed the seats were more cramped than expected, even for economy class. When we arrived at the Port au Prince airport to return to Ft. Lauderdale, we noticed a lot of shouting and upset people in line. We soon learned that Spirit had canceled our return flight without notification. Police had to be called in to quell the disturbance at the front of the line. The reason given for cancellation was ""weather"", but all other airlines were flying to Ft. Lauderdale and Miami just fine. Spirit did return about half of our round-trip ticket prices, but would not help us find a return flight or pay any of our costs for staying another night. They told us the next flight available on Spirit would be at least one week in the future! We found one-way flights the next day on another airline for $500 each. All totaled, the additional costs to get home was about $700 per person including hotel expense and changed airfare (e.g. missed connecting flights). I wouldn't recommend ever flying on Spirit Airlines. They are known to cancel flights at the last minute, and they will not help you when they cancel.

I'm quite tech savvy but their in flight viewing control system remained a mystery to me, I managed to watch stuff but it wasn't particularly intuitive.

"  Flew Chicago to Brussels via Copenhagen and Stockholm. SAS did a solid job overall on this trip in both directions. The long-haul planes were clean and spacious, the short-haul ones, clean and cramped. Check in at O'Hare was fast and easy, check in at Brussels-Zaventem was chaotic. The crews were efficient and friendly (if not exactly engaged and charming, like those on, say, Aer Lingus). The seats were fine, and the entertainment system offered an interesting range of new and classic movies and shows. It was very nice to have some local offerings (subtitled). As for the food and beverages, they were so-so. There was only one meal option. And it did seem miserly and even a little embarrassing to offer only one complimentary non-alcoholic drink-and to repeat that fact several times over the intercom. Should we take up a collection to help the company stave off bankruptcy? Water, coffee, and tea were available free the entire flight, at least. All in all, SAS seems to be doing a halfway decent job of splitting the difference between its former higher-quality self and its cheapo, barbones Nordic rivals like WOW and Norwegian. I would definitely fly SAS economy to Copenhagen or Stockholm again if either were my final destination. I am not sure that I would do so on a connecting flight: the huge, slow lines facing transiting passengers for security and then again for immigration in both Copenhagen and Stockholm (jostling with masses of people for an hour just to *leave* the Schengen zone?) frustrated me to no end. If you are connecting through either of those airports, make sure that you have multiple hours (3+) in between your flights. Don't listen to the lucky people who landed when things were calm and breezed through the obstacle course. You never know how many flights will have landed the same time as yours. These airports are simply not equipped to deal with any more than a few passengers at a time. CPH and ARN made me long for crazy but more prepared Reykjavik-Keflavik.",Passive

The airplanes have much spaced and are comfortable. (Similar to business class seats of other domestic Indian airlines). When I sat on my seat I felt like I had upgraded my ticket to business class at no extra cost). Each passenger was served a fresh and excellent meal at no extra cost (unlike super over charged stale sandwiches from the other domestic airlines). I am a foodie so trust me the food was amazing. They even served coffee and tea to everyone at no extra charge (I pay 160 Rs to 200 Rs for one coffee with other domestic airlines). The ambience of airplanes reflects the Indian culture. You receive warmth, love and care like you would receive from any Indian home. I had a bad impression of Air India until today.

The onboard service may be nothing too special, but you'll still get a warm snack and complimentary drinks. For two hour flights that's sufficient.

We purchased 4 SAS Plus tickets but when we boarded the plane, we were shocked to learn that 3 of us were assigned to one row while other SAS Plus passengers in front of us, beside us and for several rows behind us received an empty seat in between two seats. The seating reassignment was essentially a downgrade because of overbooking without any compensation. When we checked-in, we were asked by the staff at the check-in counter whether or not we wanted to take the earlier flight. Since we made arrangements to meet our tour guide later, we did not agree and politely refused. The staff was then on the phone for several minutes before being able to print our boarding passes. We were not told of the change in seating arrangement and only found out on the plane. Being the only family onboard the plane that received this treatment, it felt as though we were treated unfairly because we were travelling as a family and was a traumatic experience for us.

"I did a round trip to Ulaanbaatar from July 23-Aug 7. The following two gripes about business class. 1) As I have read with other reviews, the business class seats are not truly lie flat. There is a headrest-pillow attachment which is fixed in place and it really prevents a comfortable lie flat position. The area in the seat shell is also too narrow for the upper portion of your body (I am 5'9' and 135 lbs) and you can not comfortably rest on your side. I have flown Air New Zealand business and their seats are fabulous. They have a seat that flops forward creating a flat surface which is then covered with a mattress. They also give you a quilt cover instead of a blanket. 2) The flight is anywhere from 12-13+ hrs depending on direction. The first meal is served after take off which is fine, however the second meal came approximately 6 hrs before landing. This only allowed for 4-5 hrs of sleep if you wanted to have both meals. There is not reason that. The second could have been served 3 hrs before l a doing allowing at least 6-7 hrs sleep with enough time. For the flight attendants to get things cleaned up. 3) The choice of food was off. When we left Korea at 12.55am they served dinner. 5 hrs later they served a meal that resembled a lunch. It would have been better had they waited until 3 hrs before landing (at JFK at 10am) if they served breakfast.",Detractor

Larnaca to Budapest. Our cabin bags were checked by WizzAir staff on checkin as well as check in bags. They confirmed our cabin bags were suitable weight and size. When we're about to board they told us they weren't suitable and had to pay 60 Euro cash or we couldn't board. Emailed WizzAir to complain and they take an unacceptable amount of time to respond. By packing so many people into the plane the legroom is uncomfortable and there isn't enough space for each persons cabin luggage to go into the overhead compartment. Works out 5 bags for each 9 seats. A cheap flight ends up being expensive when you add in the bags for checkin and the payment charges as well as the booking charges. Save your money and go a proper airline.,Detractor
" Brisbane to Moscow via Adelaide / Doha, and Qatar Airways is definitely one of the best airlines around. Its lounges are simply the best (especially with Krug Champagne) and the product is great for all classes. Ground staff is not often on par with flight attendants but I understand the standards are different. My last flights onboard of A350 from Adelaide to Doha and A380 from Doha to Melbourne were absolutely fantastic. A321 flight with 100% occupancy are a little bit cramped, but for me Qatar Airways is one of the best airlines in the world, on par with Singapore Airlines",Promoter
"I have recently undertaken 6 flights with Avianca, on a trekking tour of Peru. I was very impressed with the new Dreamliner aircraft which offer good legroom, even in economy class. What I was much less impressed with was the lacklustre cabin crew. Most of the time they just seem uninterested or bored with their jobs. Very little interaction and few smiles. On two occasions, on these 6 flights, I asked for something - once a glass of water, and then for some duty free. On both occasions it seemed like I was causing a significant inconvenience to the crew. In the future, I would chose another airline, where possible. Avianca really need to address this issue - is working for Avianca and dealing with passengers really such a chore?",Passive
"  Taipei to Seoul 12th February. Waited for 1 hour for 2 hour flight. Delay reason being repairs in oil tanks. They are looking for parts for the replacement in the oil tanks.

I was on flight AMS-MAD-MEX. The airplanes are old but well maintained. Yes you don't have your own inflight entertainment but just bring your own. The seats were very comfortable and you had a lot of leg room (compared to KLM economy class). The climate onboard was wonderful no dry eyes and it was not too hot or too cold. Most of the time when I get out of the plane after a long haul flight I am absolutely wrecked. The food was not that good I must say but who eats these meals anyway? The flight attendants were very kind although sometimes when I asked for a glass of water he would just forget and I had to go out of my seat to get a glass. I must say they looked understaffed. I would definitely fly with Iberia again. The value for money is great.,Promoter
" First time flying with this airline with my family for a trip to Tokyo and back to Manila. Have to say, economy service here is better than some business class in other airlines. Tasty Japanese food, not sure if they have other menus for other routes Very polite, trained, patient and efficient crew with little to no language barrier. Seats had pretty good space with good inflight entertainment from the regular movies, episode of series but they also have current news, sports and my favorite touch, helpful how-to act, culture videos for Japan I am trying to think any negative or inconvenience and there was really none for these flights. I guess ground crew wise, there was a couple of gate switches but when I approached the ground crew they directed me promptly. Maybe they can just improve on letting the other passengers waiting know instead of waiting for people to come to them but no worries. Overall, best airline I've tried so far.",Promoter
"  Flew London to Hamburg. I cannot believe that an airline like British Airways have to compete with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet and stopped complimentary cabin services - no drinks, no snacks. They should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines. I am now cofused why I should ever fly British Airways vs Low Cost Airlines. I was recently also flying on Club World. My luggage was tagged priority. But waited on arrival for over 30mins - non priority bags came out mixed with priority - British Airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it's losing its edge as a world reknowned airline.",Detractor
" My husband and I missed our flight due to some unforeseen circumstances while traveling from Mexico back to US. We approached the Spirit Airlines counter for assistance an hour before our flight knowing we would not have time to check our bag and make it through security in time but there were no employees where there. When an employee did show up she informed us they could put us on the next flight Saturday morning at no cost. She walked away and never returned. The other airport employees told us that there were no more Spirit Airlines flights for the rest of the day and the desk was closed, there was no one we could talk to. We called Spirit Airlines to see if they could change the flight for us and they refused to offer any assistance. This airline had a bad reputation and I usually defend them as I travel frequently and always fly Spirit but the customer service was so terrible in this situation. My husband and I will never use this airline again. They lost two customers today.",Detractor
"  London to Rio de Janeiro via Lisbon. Outbound first sector on A319 fine. Good meal with well-cooked grouper as a main. Pretty impressive for short haul. Unfortunately this was as good as it got. Discovered that no lounge airside after passport control in Lisbon, so had nearly two hours to wait in main terminal building. Boarding somewhat chaotic - aircraft to Rio an ageing A340. Cabin crew not very welcoming and the leather gloves the females wear make them appear as if they are about to strangle someone rather than provide a service of hospitality. Seat format is 2-2-2. I had chosen a central seat several weeks before in order to have as much sleep as possible and neither disturb a neighbour, nor be disturbed by one. Having settled into my seat, I was staggered when the purser called at me across the aisle to ask if I spoke English, and pressured me to move, asking loudly in front of a couple who wanted to sit together - one of them in my seat. (If somebody had a medical need, it would be a different matter. Similarly if there was a genuine requirement on the part of the operating crew. That was not the case here. They had simply not organised themselves in time.) I was therefore obliged to sit in a seat I did not wish to be in throughout the flight. My fear of being disturbed by the new seating arrangement was realised. A member of the cabin crew leant over me throughout dinner service to serve my neighbour- constantly bashing the side of my seat and speaking extremely loudly over the top of me as I tried to rest. Once the dinner service was over, managed to get some sleep",Detractor

" Rome to Gatwick. We were extremely disappointed by the rude staff (except the captain). The attendants did no attending not even offering water to drink. Did not explain anything about customs when landing or where baggage claim was. Before the flight at the airport, we had 3 bags that were carry on size and they said we had to check them. (We thought this was because there was no room on board - but the flight was only half-full) The very rude staff made us pay for 2 of our luggage giving us one free (how nice). The charge was the same as 2 passenger flights. We can see how they scam people of their money. Charging cheap flights and making their money on the bags. I do not recommend this airline terrible! We do recommend easyJet which we flew 1st and they are amazing! Funny friendly staff eager to help. Great deal and no fuss. We didnt have to pay for the same bags on this flight either.",Detractor
We flew to Geneva from ABQ on 1/16 - 1/26. Flight UA5176 UA907 UA975Y UA783Y. To start we had a 5 hr delay and our party of 6 had to be split up and re-routed to reach our overseas destination (this was not due to weather). United offered us a measly 7$ credit that was only usable in one airport for food. It didn't even cover a meal. When we finally were on our way there were further delays (once again not weather) and upon arrival our party was split and we had to pt double to take the shuttle separately to our hotel.

ARN-DOH-DAC return in economy. First leg ARN-DOH operated by a Boeing 787-8 was quite excited to fly on the B787 for the first time. We had checked in online so no long queues for us! Boarding was done on-time and efficiently. I was quite impressed with the lighting in the cabin however it felt fairly cramped in a 9-abreast configuration. The flight was about 80% full. Legroom was decent food was great the IFE was great and the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. Transfer in Doha was smooth the next flight DOH-DAC operated by an A333. Plane change from two class A333 to three class A333. Our chosen seats got changed the staff handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father was placed in business and the rest of us in economy. Flight was about 95% full. Once again a great experience with friendly flight attendants great IFE and decent legroom. Only one option for the meal which was okay nothing special. Return flight DAC-DOH operated by a two class A333. Fight was 100% full. Friendly and attentive crew as usual boarding was done efficiently. We had a great flight with excellent service as usual however the only let down was the food. Transfer in Doha-Hamad was smooth. Lovely airport. We had a pleasant flight as usual but the food was still quite bad. We were offered with one option which is quite bad IMO. We were able to choose from a handful of options on the outbound flight (ARN-DOH). However I had excellent flights with QR nonetheless and I would gladly choose them again in the future!,Promoter

"  Tallahassee to Vail via Dallas Ft Worth. We are the only ones in priority check in just to be ignored while employees are having a great time talking and laughing. Then the one employee checking coach class customers helped 2 other customers while we felt like fools for paying first class prices. All was well and the 1st class cabin was comparable to competitors. Food was a disgrace. Service was good. White wine was served warm with no apologies. On our return again ignored while standing in priority check in while watching coach class customers jump ahead. Again food was a disgrace. This time the stewardess did say the white wine was not yet cold. And gave us the option of warm or waiting a while for it to chill. While waiting to board in DFW we ask if there would be a meal served. Trying to decide if we needed to purchase and carry on something for lunch. To our surprise neither of the 2 AA employees knew and had no idea how to find out. I guess my biggest problem is that first class prices should be supported with first class service and food. Our expectations are based on Delta's 1st class service. Pre flight video wasted no time bragging about being the largest airline with 6700 planes. And yes that's impressive, But please note, I can only fly in one plane at a time and really expect that flight to compare to the airlines with less than 6700 planes.

"Another series of fine flights with Alaska. Redeye to Seattle with a fine crew. Service was good. Plane was clean and on time. We had one unusual thing happen - a person apparently acted out in some manner towards a crew member right after we pulled back from the gate. We then returned to the gate and this ""gentleman"" was escorted off our plane. After that excitement we were off with no further issues. Upon landing at SeaTac I made my way eventually to the Boardroom where I enjoyed coffee and rolls, caught up on news and relaxed. The flight to ATL went fine. Again, plane was clean, crew was great and appeared quite professional in all regards. The return leg went fine. The pilot on the outbound leg to Seattle informed us of some possible rough air coming up over the St Louis area which folks appreciated. The food I ate was decent and the wine was enjoyable as well.

We food/drink service started fairly quickly after takeoff, we skipped the ample dessert opting to get some sleep. As usual the food is excellent.

October 18 Seat 23H Flight EY461. Melbourne to Abu Dhabi. I suppose it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between this flight and the Emirates 777 economy service to Dubai. Having done both now I would say they are fairly level pegging apart from the fact that Etihad uses an A340 600 with a 2x4x2 configuration much preferable to Emirates 3x4x3 for couples. The A340 is very quiet and surprisingly comfortable even on a 14 hour leg. Clients wanting to stopover will prefer Dubai. While boarding was orderly and relaxed the experience was spoiled a little at check-in. I had booked through Virgin Australia using points and pay - and assumed travel on a major partner airline would be seamless. No such luck. First the check-in guy had to call Virgin - then the airport duty manager got involved and eventually phoned Abu Dhabi for approval. Meanwhile we went for a long walk - it was that or be stabbed in the back by the anxious horde waiting to be checked in. Finally all was fixed - but it took about 40 minutes. The welcoming crew were bright and chatty and flight EY461 left Melbourne on time. Note that the bins above the window seats are smaller than the centre aisle. Safety instructions are via animated video and crew demos. The entertainment screens are a good size and the touch system really easy and simple to use. Emirates ICE is also great but the touch controls don't always work all that well. About a half hour out hot paper towels were served and dinner started 40 minutes later. I had Moroccan beef casserole in couscous not the most appealing looking dish but quite tasty thanks mostly to the black olives. I was pleased to see Australian products were used. The meals are medium in size the other noteworthy point is that steel utensils are used. I had a glass of red wine and asked for another when the trays were taken but the bottle had gone. To her credit the hostess did fill my glass later. Breakfast was scrambled eggs with the lot - fine for me. To summarise: Apart from the hiccup at check-in smooth good value flying.,Passive
" Houston to Los Angeles. We boarded at 7:30 pm everything seem to be ok and we were on the run off ready to take off when he captain announced the plane has to returned to the gate due some mechanical problem, we were repeatedly asked to stay on the plane. After almost 4+ (11:30 pm) hours we were told the plane was fixed and that we would be taking off. 30 minutes later we were told they didn't have any flight attendants because they have to check out due â€œlong hoursâ€ and if we waited a few minutes the replacement flight attendants were in the airport and on their way. After another hour of waiting we were told they couldn't get flight attendants and deboarded the plane. I was in lne trying to get in to the earliest flight posible and ask for arrangements to sleep since it was almost 1:40am airline personel where rude, refuse to make areangements to reroute baggage to my flight because there was nobody to do it at that time... they also told me as a local i was not entitle to accomodations they asked me to go home and return at 4am to board my new flight for the rest they keep telling people not to stand in line. United was completely unprepared, how could they not know if the repair took longer than 2 hours their flight attendants would time out. How did they not already have a back-up plan in case the repair took longer than 2 hours. they had plenty time to Make arrangements to help passanger they left stranded althdought they wait until last minute when everybody in the airport was gone, i even findout the flight was delayed until next morning by checking online before they announced it. Customer service is unexistant... even over the phone people lied to me with different stories and promises they knew they were lies, my luggage arrived late at my destination dispite several employees assuring me it was going to be on my new flight... on top of experience rude employee in IAH the phone personel are useless and several hung up on me.. nobody care how much they abuse passangers.

Return journey departing at 12 noon only served either hot drink and 1 biscuit or cold drink and small of packet of crisps.

We travelled first class Sydney to Paris via Abu Dhabi and return in September/October. We had 2 previous experiences with Etihad on this same flight both in Business Class. The first time in 2009 was excellent. Service meals attention to detail was second to none. The second trip was a little less so less attentive the calibre of meals had deteriorated somewhat and service was definitely in decline. So this time we thought we would go First Class. Such a disappointment. From the check in at Sydney Airport - where apart from not being in a queue we could have been anyone for the level of attention and reception received. Thank heavens for the Express Passes to get us quickly through customs and immigration. The cabins in First were excellent the flat beds long and as comfortable as you could get and the beds were made up with sheets. Cabin crew were efficient but certainly lacked the warmth of previous flights. The chefs advised that they could prepare anything for us where in fact the meals were very ordinary and unimaginative. It also took a long time to be served. I know they were striving for a 'dining experience' but when you are tired and hungry you don't want to wait nearly 4 hours as we did on our flight home. I also don't want to hear how tired the staff are how busy they are or any other excuses as we did on several flights.

"Washington - LHR. We arrived early for our 18.30 departure as we intended eating in the new BA Executive lounge. It is about two months old and is a very good set up indeed. Plenty of seating that is well spread out and comfortable. The food was plentiful freshly cooked both varied and tasty. No complaints so far. We were seated in the two most forward seats on the upper deck of the A380. Seats 50A and 50B. I was happy facing my wife - but really would not be happy to be staring at a stranger for a longish flight. I hope this weird seating design is changed in the near future. It was the so called latest Club World seat in a rather gloomy grey colour. In fact the whole cabin ambiance is different tones of grey. It has been some time since I have flown Club - the last being on a 777 to Antigua in 2010. I am absolutely sure this ""new"" seat is smaller. We pushed back on time and as soon as the lights dimmed I well put it this way tried to get some sleep. It was a horrendous experience. In 35 years of aviation travel I have completed hundreds of flights and this was by far the worse - ever ! I simply could not get comfortable and drift off to sleep. The temperature was fine. Noise level was minimal. The ""bed"" was rock hard. To narrow. To short. The seat controls were fiddly and not user friendly. I arrived into LHR without so much as 15 minutes of sleep. I had no difficulty in sleeping on the 777 Club product - and back then I was 20 kilos heavier. This product is not cheap (On some sectors its as high as Â£7000 return) - although we purchased our tickets on Avios - with a 1st Class outbound and Club return. The saving grace was a strong tail wind that shot us across the pond in 6.5 hours. I couldn't wait to get off.",Detractor

" I was flying from DÃ¼sseldorf to Geneva on the 03.03.2018 with Eurowings. I booked the flight with departure time at 7.05 and arrival time at 08.25. After 16 days Eurowings changed the departure time to 06.25 and also the duration of the flight as the arrival time remained the same (from 1 hour and 20 minutes to 1 hour and 50 minutes) without any explanation. When I got to the airport, after the check in the departure time was delayed by 30 minutes at 7.05 due to a freezing in the toilet area of the airplane. We finally got in the plane at 8 o'clock instead of 6 o'clock where we have waited for about one and a half hour for take off. When we finally arrived in Geneva at 11.15 we couldn't get off the plane because of some other plane taking our parking place as we were told by the captain. The doors opened at 11.45 so the overall delay was over 3 hours. During all these hours we were offered only 5 centimeters of sandwich and a water. I checked after 5 days online there was an online form for a reimboursement of 250 euros for the delay that was never sent by email so the company doesn't inform passengers on their legal rights and also after completing the form I have never received a confirmation email. The plane was an old airberlin plane, a bit dirty and old interior but with good leg room. Nevertheless the crew was smiling and really nice.

We flew from SGN-BKK return in June 2012. I flew Air Asia ten years ago and found it was a fun inexpensive airline. How things have changed! It seems Air Asia is now all about squeezing as much money as possible out of the unsuspecting passenger. I can understand budget airlines charging more for the extra space of exit row seats but to charge you $11 extra because you have a medical condition that requires an aisle seat so you can walk during the flight or the same treatment to a passenger with motion-sickness being denied a window seat is a blatant rip-off. Your seat is selected randomly by a computer and if you don't like it then you pay $11 to change it. In Bangkok I tried to call Air Asia's office 3 times but each call dropped out while I was waiting to speak to someone. The old 10kg baggage allowance has been reduced to 7 kg. (My carry-on wheeled backpack weighs 3kg) so that means I can pack not much more than my toiletries bag and a change of underwear before I exceed the weight limit. If you book on-line checked baggage fees and insurance are added unless you â€œuncheckâ€ them. Boarding in BKK was a case of â€œfirst rush first aboardâ€. The flight itself was fine but the entire Air Asia experience leaves a lot to be desired.,Detractor
I just booked a trip with Spirit but am going to cancel and take the loss. Talk about a rip off. They charge more for baggage than any other airline including carry-on. You have to pay for a carry on unless it fits under the seat. Their cancellation fee is higher than any other airline and you have to pay for an assigned seat. While their fares seem reasonable at first with all the add ons they are more expensive than most major carriers.

"Dallas to Barcelona via Miami. I wonder how many times American Airlines are told that they are literally the worst airline? The service is atrocious and they simply don't care.

Just a blank stare like it is my fault. Save yourself the grief.",Detractor
"Sydney to Dublin via Dubai, and Emirates have an average to good business class product. Flew both legs on 777 with only issue being the seats are angled lie flat which was a disappointment.

Staff on both legs were both professional and friendly.",Passive
" When I am writing this review about my trip with Delta, I have to use my cell phone data (the hotel's wifi doesn't work). Let start with my ticket: it's a round-trip ticket from Binghampton to New Orleans and versa. The flight from Binghamton --> New Orleans was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-5 Then, this was how it happened. My first flight was delayed for 1h30min, and of course, I missed my connecting flight. I have to stay in a hotel overnight in Detroit. I don't have much time with my family this trip, and now I have to spend 1 night in the middle of nowhere. I was really mad with them, they gave me a voucher $100, and at least I felt they care about my feeling. At that point, I can rate them 4 stars. The flight was delayed, but the reaction was good. The flight from New Orleans --> Binghamton was 5:30 PM to 11:30 PM on Oct-10. Again, the first flight was delayed for ""2 hours"". And again, I have to stay in Detroit 1 more night. I can't imagine how my trip 5 days with 4 days with my family turned into 6 days with 3 days at home. I contacted them about my issue, now the attitude was changed, they thought that they gave me $100 voucher and it's done. I deserve to have the delay one more time ""on the same trip"". They sent me to a hotel name Travelodge, it's a very very bad hotel. I arrived at the hotel at 11:30PM and hadn't had dinner yet. I was thirsty and need some water. Since I don't have cash with me so I ask the help desk at the hotel for some water. After I said I don't have cash, she told me to drink water in the bathroom, ""it's OK!"". Now the wifi doesn't work, but I have to write this because I am really mad now. The lesson is: you may have a fault, but the way you fix it is more important. For the person who thought that $100 voucher is big, and it's ok to wait 2 nights for 2 delays on the same trip, I'm ashamed of you, you are so cheap! Thanks ""Delay"" Airline for a wonderful flight!",Detractor

Three people family was forced to sit at three different seat including my minor child, Same meal was repeated. We were given last seat in the return journey.

"  I had high expectations of Singapore Airlines but this flight from Shanghai to Singapore was just good. Plane was the oldest A380-800 which will be retired in few months. Good IFE but not touch-screen. Selection of movies was good but should be improved. As a Star Alliance Gold member, I was given a seat in the small Economy class section on the upper deck. As such a section was quite empty, I had a full row for myself. Service was good, smiling and polite cabin crew, but not the most proactive. Drinks selection was rather limited for a 5 hours flight, no sparking wine available. The hot meal served was of poor quality.

"CMB-DXB: EK655: A330-200 Oct 12: Business Class. Plane immaculate for its age (1999-2000). However horribly let down by the most uncomfortable Business Class seats I've ever experienced over the past 17 years. Seven across in Business Class instead of six in an A330 is a rip-off. These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats. Not suitable for the 4.5 hour flight. Service was very good and the food and beverages were good too. There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds. The whole experience was let down by these awful seats the main reason one buys Business Class in the first place to get more personal space not something worse-than Economy Plus. Check-in and the dedicated Emirates Lounge at the BIA in CMB were excellent. On time performance and good baggage transfer to my connecting BA flight. EK is generally good but not their A330-200 seats.",Passive
Flew from Singapore to ICN and back in 777-300. My first time flying with Korean Air. Overall service is ok. It is the minimum what a premium airline would provide. My flight to ICN departed after 10pm and they served dinner at about mid-night. Only turned down the lights at about near 2am and woke us up at 4am to prepare for landing. No snack was served before landing at ICN. I would have preferred they serve us a snack after take off and breakfast before landing. The timing for serving food on the return flight was also a bit odd. Took off at 2pm and served us lunch at about 3.30pm. Then a snack at 5pm just before landing. Flight attendants also did not serve drinks throughout both the flight. Only during meal times. In flight entertainment was ok. Small movies selection. Took Singapore Airlines a few weeks before this flight. I must say SIA is a lot better.,Passive
FRA-IAD and next morning IAD-MIA in business. FRA-IAD flight had to return to gate to get some loose freight container fixed so plane left with 2 hour delay. Otherwise flight was fine. Seats were reasonably comfortable entertainment OK. The inflight service was excellent with a delicious menu and very attentive flight attendants who regularly walked around with drinks and snacks. Baggage delivery at IAD was very fast. Domestic connection next morning also fine. Friendly and efficient check-in. Seats were comfortable and flight left on time. On the domestic leg they served drinks and a warm cookie. Baggage delivery on arrival reasonably quick.,Passive
"  Edinburgh to Providence. They changed the flight time from 1740 to 1715. We were so early for our flight that there was no gate for us to go, so decided to have dinner while we waited. Mistake made, never eat out of security point. Mistake two was not verifying the boarding pass. So we missed our flight. What did Norwegian do to help us out, nothing. We have to pay for another two tickets to an airport 2 hours away from home vs the 20 minutes we would have been originally causing us the rent a car ($$) and pay for a hotel room for the night because we couldn't get another flight until the next day. My concern is also that the airline knew we were on the premises and did nothing to make contact. When we get check in the person at the desk tell us that our bag is too heavy and need to pay $108 for the extra weight which was not a problem the day before. The only pro was the lady that handle issues took pity and only charged us $48.",Detractor
"  On the 13th June 2017 I travelled from Mykonos to London Heathrow on BA 651. If British airways are trying to compete with budget airlines they are failing dismally. We were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase. All we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits. This flight left around lunchtime and I would have thought it would be obvious there would be a large demand for something to eat. To add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only one card machine in operation. If there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with. I have today received a telephone call from BA following my initial complaint which really served no purpose. It was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which doesn't help me. A service which was very good before the cost cutting. 'We fly to serve' I somehow don't think so anymore. Easy jet, Ryanair and other budget airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles. I cannot imagine flying with BA again.",Detractor

Shortly before boarding my flight from London to Amman I found out my partner (who I was meant to be meeting at the airport in Amman) had missed his flight and wouldn't be arriving until the following day.

I spoke to the crew as I boarded and they were incredibly helpful - they rung ahead to organise an airport transfer from my hotel in Madaba and even offered to see me safely into the taxi at Amman. This was very reassuring and some of the best service I've received from any airline.,Promoter
HAM-SVO-HAM first time with AFL-Business class. Check In at Hamburg very quick. Shared Lounge with acceptable refreshments. Boarding well organized. The big surprise was the C Class cabin. It is a separated cabin with wall and real C Class seats and seat pitch. After seated the FA offered a glass of champagne or orange juice and handed over the lunch menu (3 choices). After take off the purser came and greeted every passenger personally and handed over the portable IFE Digiplayer. Digiplayer offered limited IFE but more than okay for a 3 hrs flight. Lunch was very tasty. Arrival at Moscow Sheremetyevo newest Terminal D.

This complete lack of understanding is not what I expected from an airline that claims to be awarded for its service! Last year I had flown Garuda from Surabaya to Jakarta and I faced the same issue.

  Istanbul to London. I am sad to say British Airways is little more than a budget airline masquerading as a really very expensive one. It hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a budget airline and British airways except the ticket price. My disappointment is so high because I had high expectations I paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins.

Cabin interior on 777 from LHR to ICN seemed tired. Seats were almost lie flat but combination of protruding headrest and small pillow was most uncomfortable. Cabin stiflingly, almost unbearably, hot during the night. Much more comfortable on A380 on second leg. Food mediocre on both legs. One western (beef and potatoes) and two Korean main courses. Accompaniments basic at best. A limited choice of a couple of reasonable red and white wines on the menu but when presented by staff this came over as whether your preference was red or white with no bottles or indication of the range of choice on display. IFE basic with small range of movies and a definite shortage of blockbusters. Remote did not work on first leg. Staff were generally capable and keen to please on both legs.

Travelled AC 001-002 YYZ-NRT B777-300. Two class layout with the classic pods herringbone layout. Always love these layouts. Flew round trip June 5-11. Everything was excellent. Always impressed by AC service. Went to bed as soon as we took off and opted for the dine on demand service instead of the regular meal service. Crew made sure everything stayed warm until I was ready to eat. The food was great for 35000ft up. Bar service always great never have to worry about not having anything to drink. Usual breakfast before landing was so so. Only recommendation would be to time the meals for the time of day. We landed at 5PM continental breakfast at 3pm isn't exactly exciting but its better than nothing. Crew were fantastic always attentive asking if they could you anything else. Seats super comfy.

Flight LH797 (Dec 11 2014) from Hong Kong to Frankfurt in economy class I don't have a frequent flyer status (yet) however I try to be loyal to one company. New Boeing 747-8 in economy - you get what you paid for I always say - but due to my unpleasant experience below some observations that should be taken into consideration. Seats are extremely uncomfortable and the given space on the 747-8 feels incredibly cramped - Lufthansa's smaller airplanes are controversially far more spacious - I get they want to squeeze in as many passengers on the plane but on a +12 hrs flight you don't want to feel like a sardine in a can!

 Washington to London via Reykjavik. Not a good choice. No relationship with TSA so you can't use Global Entry in the USA and a hand baggage allowance that's so small it's less than US domestic carriers. Result - travelling clutching valuables after they insist on checking in my one and only piece of luggage. And staff at check in particularly rude. It was a fair priced ticket but there reaches a point when you silently decide you are never going to use an airline again and mention the fact to those you work with. That happened tonight. I suspect it will in the end collapse financially because if it's going to be cheap it also needs to be cheerful - and it wasn't.,Detractor

We flew to Rome from Toronto. The seats were very uncomfortable. The television monitors were the old style down the centre and far apart and showing a movie with English subtitles. Our return flight was no better I'd say it was worse. The boarding was a free for all no help for seniors or folks with little ones. They started to load from the front then opened the back doors so you had folks trying to squeeze past each other in the aisles with luggage while others were stowing belongings - it was chaos. Our seats were dirty stained and torn fabric pockets were ripped. The meal - dried out and cold pasta that they called a lasagne. Needless to say never again.,Detractor

Air New Zealand - NZ5 LAX to AKL. Poor customer service poor communications. Poor seating. What more can I say but poor. What is the point of preferred seating with airlines if they then change the aircraft type and do not move the allocated passenger seating around. I am well over 6 foot with a minor back injury and had booked an exit seat over 9 months in advance so that I could have a bit of comfort. It appears that the aircraft type was changed out of LAX but this was not passed on to the passengers so when we boarded I found my 'exit' seat was now stuck in the middle of the aircraft. Even with the seat in front of me fully raised I could not sit with my legs straight in front rather splayed either side. When the seat was reclined I had no space at all and the insides of my knees were constantly rubbing against the seat in front and it meant that my knees were encroaching on the passenger next to me. Also the media screen is then just inches from you and is pretty useless to view.

Flew Air France flight 0007 which is a JFK-CDG flight. Flight departed on time boarding times were good considering that the plane was an A380 (still however if you do not like waiting to board on long lines then I suggest you take one of their several other daily flights).

Didn't have to pay for my first checked bag (I would suggest trying to fit everything into one however as the second bag is expensive). My only complaint is that I had checked in online and only had to drop off a bag at JFK's check-in desks but the line was huge and it was not apparent that there was a separate line for people like me.

Flew from LHR to DOH 23rd February for an onward connection to Phuket. The connection at Doha was very tight at 45 mins but I assumed that Qatar had it sorted for a quick transit. QR 002 arrived in Doha 10 minutes behind schedule so not an ideal start. It took ground staff almost 15 mins to get the first passengers off. Absolutely no help from ground personnel to fast track to connection. Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left. I know for a fact that this flight arrives in Phuket most days almost an hour ahead of schedule so why not wait for the dozen affected passengers. I booked my ticket direct with Qatar so would have expected them to assist me to make a tight connection that they sold me.,Passive
"  Overall we got a really good value for money. This one-way flight from Tel Aviv to Craiova costs approximately 15 USD. The aircraft was new with decent legroom. Seating is not very comfortable, especially when you are tired and the seat does not recline, but it's not too bad on short-haul flights, The cabin crew was nice and friendly even when my companion forgot his boarding pass on the bus leading to the aircraft. The food and beverages are sold at decent prices (sandwich - 4 euros, snacks 0.5-3 euros, water - 2 euros, meal combo which includes a sandwich, a drink, and a snack - 7 euros). The quality of the food is quite good compared to airplane food. I continued with them to Rome Ciampino and returned to Tel Aviv with them via Bucharest. They have been consistent throughout all of these flights. Wizzair does not offer in-flight entertainment, but you can bring your own - no big deal. Wizzair have been fair when they changed our flight time by 30 minutes - we could either accept the change, get a full refund, get a 120% refund to use on wizzair or choose a different flight in comparable routes for free.",Promoter
" This airlines customer service in Denver is the worst. They don't care and don't follow up. They lost my luggage and didn't put any notes in the computer.

"  NZ805 Christchurch to Brisbane. I consider this flight an excellent choice for having sufficient time in the morning in Christchurch to have brunch with family before flying home. Check in effortless at Christchurch Airport. Made use of Koru Lounge prior to boarding with Koru membership. Boarding quick. Aircraft perhaps 85% full. Once loaded, an unexpected 30 minute delay occurred. However, flight landed in Brisbane 15 minutes early. The only male flight attendant presented as disinterested, appearing unhappy and 'going through the motions.' Female flight attendants were positively engaged in their occupation. Food offerings consisted of two hot meals for 'The Works' passengers. The beef, rice and vegetable option was tasty enough for airline food. However portion small. It has been noted on a number of Air New Zealand flights taken recently that soft drinks are not served by the can, but rather out of the can and into the plastic cup by the flight attendants. While innocent in service to passengers, this is portion control by any description and therefore Air New Zealand cost cutting. I have also noticed that when the Customer Service Manager reads the offerings out across the PA, there is no mention of soft drinks, only tea, coffee and water. Bags out on belt within 15 minutes at Brisbane Airport. While I consider Air New Zealand to be a good airline, they pale in comparison to Qantas with service delivery. Overall a good flight, but Air New Zealand let themselves down with these issues.",Promoter
Just returned from USA flying both ways with United. 3rd flight this year flying with United to SFO connecting to ACV (Eureka). United is the only commercial airline flying into ACV. Food is never that great but that's pretty much the norm with most airlines I guess. Inflight entertainment is perfect with personal screens (777 aircraft if flying 747 then just multi screen). I am a silver mileage plus member so currently gain access to economy plus free of charge which is a bonus along with the extra benefits of being a silver mileage plus member. Outbound flight on time three seats to stretch out across which was great. Returning from SFO to LHR all crew London based. The service from the Base crew was the worst I have experienced from any cabin crew. I've even flown US Airways a couple of times in the past and anyone who has flow US Airways will know how scratchy their service is but even US Airways cabin crew offered better service than what I witnessed from the London base crew with United. Crew looked like they didn't want to be there drinks service only twice for a 10 hour flight food awful. Breakfast just a croissant and a couple of chunks of melon why even bother. Maybe United should send out WYR surveys to passengers and that way they would get a broad idea of a customers experience. However I'm not flying with United for cheap smiles and attractive cabin crew and 1st class service what I am flying with United for is airline miles premier service with mileage plus and an airline that can get me to my final destination the rest is just extra.,Passive
My first time with Iberia and I was quite sceptical about this airline when I read the reviews from other customers. The flight was from Malaga to Rio de Janeiro with 1 hour stop in Madrid. We departed with a delay of almost half an hour because the air traffic control would not allow our flight to land on time because of heavy traffic in Madrid. The pilot from Malaga was extremely helpful keeping us informed all the time about the situation and he did everything he could to arrive at a decent time. In my opinion this is a big plus for Iberia. At Madrid Iberia personnel waited for us at the gate to help us make a fast transfer to the transatlantic flight. MAD to GIG was with an Airbus A340-600 with the newly installed inflight entertainment system which is very nice with lots of movies a good selection of music and ease of use. There was plenty of leg space nothing to complain. Food was very good served 3 times never felt I was hungry. Overall I am very pleased with Iberia.

"Ground staff at Lisbon we're polite and good natured, but they couldn't for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from Dubai to Sydney despite trying for sometime, and in the end I told them I'd sort it in Dubai - in hindsight a mistake. The flight was pleasant enough, although as this is Emirates you'll have to endure Arabic subtitles over your movies. I'm not sure why as an international airline they don't offer non subtitled option. Arrived at Dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. Lined up at Emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. Everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. Next customer service rep was the same, told me to catch the train and waved me away. Walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at Emirates for not being just a little more polite. I then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a Qantas desk. Got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business. Excellent, or so I thought - I spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight, even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when I land due to being fresh at the other end. Got to the boarding gate in the lounge, made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late, to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude Emirates Rep! Didn't properly click what was going on until I got to the door of the aircraft where I approached the Qantas cabin crew. The first girl was disinterested, non-empathetic and in the end I had to walk away from her. In the end I got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers (insinuating that maybe I'd made up the story) might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. I was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the Lisbon Emirates ground staff shouldn't have upgraded me. I briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it. So I was stuck where I was - I guess you get what you pay for. I was a platinum FF for 5-6 years now I'm just a gold it's amazing how differently you get treated.",Detractor
" I flew Pegasus from Beirut to Istanbul last week - rude flight attendants. It was a dirty aircraft with dirty bathrooms. People kept on trying to open the air vents above their heads, but no air come through. Everything on this airplane was for money. No screen, maps or No food. Moreover, on our day back to Beirut, they have changed the flight time an hour and didnt inform us about that - we missed our flight because of them and they have cancelled our ticket to Beirut and made us pay another one way ticket.

I was asked not to use my phone, even if in flight mode (is this not 2016?). The passenger sat across from me had his phone on throughout the flight and was watching a movie. I was ordered to remove my headphones for landing - the two passengers sat next to me had no such request made. I am all for policy, but let's keep it consistent across all passengers.",Detractor
Recently returned from a trip to Thailand and had an awful experience with China Eastern Airlines (JFK-PVG-BKK). Before the trip: I spent hours on the phone trying to get hold of a representative to get a seat assignment. No luck. On the outbound segment I missed my connection in JFK (due to a delay from my home city) and could not find a CEA representative anywhere in the terminal. After hours on the phone I was rebooked to a flight the next day. Once I arrived in Shanghai I learned that my flight was cancelled (due to weather not the airlines fault) but the airline could not provide any assistance. A mob of passengers flocked the gate agent. Finally the flight was reinstated for 2.30am but again there was no clear communication and no guaranteed rebooking. In sum total chaos and no help from the airline.,Detractor

Travelled QF9 LHR-DXB on August 22nd. Had pre-booked at a cost of 25AUD per person to allocate seats 75D and 75E. Checked in with no problems but at boarding gate were advised our seats had been re-allocated. We made the point that we had actually pre-booked and paid for the seat allocation and were a bit put out that we had been selected to be moved when in all probability there were other passengers on the flight who had not gone to the trouble of pre-booking seats. Apparently a family wished to be accommodated together. The clerk at the counter gave us our new boarding passes row 88. We said we were happy as long as they were not next to the toilets. We don't make a habit of sitting near toilets in restaurants or airplanes hence the reason we paid the money to pre-book allocation. The clerk checked on his monitor and categorically assured us they were not next to toilets. Having boarded the aircraft we realized we were duped. Row 88 is the farthest row back and is sandwiched between two toilets. Furthermore the seats have limited recline. They are also immediately in front of a bulkhead behind which is situated some form of noisy refrigeration unit for the self service galley area immediately behind us. We were not provided with equivalent seats for which we had paid. More to the point they were arguably the worst seats on the plane. The constant noise from the flushing toilets and refrigeration unit made it impossible to intelligibly listen to any IFE. My partner was very upset at the reallocated seats and credit to the cabin crew they were sympathetic towards our situation and indeed was not their fault. Whilst on the flight we walked through the cabin to check out our pre-booked seats. By no means was it a family with young children in our seats.

In recent years I have noticed massive improvements in the service of CX flight ground staff and reservations etc. I now attempt to use HK as my transit point to anywhere Asia. My most frequent route being LHR-HKG-PEN return so that allows me to test both long haul and regional the same time. Long haul depending on which flight the old configuration on the 747-400 is still very comfortable especially when travelling solo but not great when travelling in pairs or if you like looking out the windows. I always like sitting on the upper deck. The new configuration on the 777-300ER are by far the best business class seats I have ever experience. You can have great view outside or in pairs the middle seats allow both privacy or dining together depending what you enjoy. Extremely comfortable travel all round with great food and service.

"  Flight from Atlanta to San Francisco with Frontier Airlines. Paid double the ticket price to check in bags. Flight was $75 and the baggage fee was $145. My son flew this flight. I flew 2 weeks later from San Francisco to Atlanta and charged a completely different baggage fee carrying the same exact item. Called customer service to ask ""Why?"" they have no answer and said it's up to who ever checks you in. From SFO to ATL they misplaced 1 bag, they allowed a daily spending fee and dropped off the bag on a Sunday at 3am. The daily fee was minimal. The cheapness of the flight is made up in fees. No drink or food without being charged besides a small glass of water.",Detractor

Luton-Warsaw-Luton. I printed my boarding passes (2 pages) from the online site and did not have any bags to check-in. The planes were bright. Cabin crew friendly. Leaving the plane at Warsaw delayed because it seemed impossible to find steps that would reach to the right height of the aircraft door. Same problem on return leg. On the outward flight seat pitch was comfortable but on the return seat pitch was very cramped and uncomfortable. Luckily the plane was not full and no-one sat in the middle seat of my row but this is not ideal for a long flight. I used their minibus service from Warsaw airport to the city. As we arrived late at night and with a delay I was pleased the bus had waited. Driver friendly but drove like a maniac down long straight roads with little traffic from the airport and through a few red lights. Overall good service but would hesitate to use Wizz again because of the seat-pitch being so small.,Passive

They located the bag and said they would deliver it. I had to wait two days before my bag got there, which was half of my vacation.

"Overall based on a round-trip flight between IAD and SFO I would give United 0 stars. On the outbound leg there was a medical emergency on-board and the United flight crew was totally unprepared to handle the situation.

Our return flight was delayed by almost 5 hours with not even ""we apologize"" for the delay from United. Then our bags were placed on a different flight that didn't arrive until 1 hours after our flight and the bags didn't show up at the airport until 4 hours after we landed. Again no apologies from United. then we got numerous texts from United about the status of our bags. One even claimed the bags arrived at IAD 2 hours before we did.

Hong Kong to Singapore on CX711 on 8 August 2013. The seats were narrow with no room space to straighten legs. Worse when the passenger in front row reclines their seat. Food is terrible tasteless and meatless. Service is slow. Requested warm water and they took ages to serve it.

First flight was a 16 year old A319, plane was very clean and comfortable.

You cold only tell that it was that old becouse it was considerably louder but the journey was very enjoyable. The snacks are not very good, but I can forgive that on a 2h 15 min flight.

My bag was delayed on the connection which was annoying but acceptable for a day, but less ideal when it became a second day with no explanation or contact from Turkish Airlines. But, their response to the issue was the worst and most customer unfriendly service I have ever had from any provider or any service, and has remained so for weeks. No ability to raise the issue by email, and online service down. No-one seeming to read anything submitted, in favour of moving it to another department as fast as possible and not just once, but time and time again. Asking for image of my passport (that they didn't need), over an online submission form that is insecure, in breach of their own privacy policy and all passably acceptable practice",Detractor

"  Having used Eurowings / Germanwings / Lufthansa for the past few years flying frequently throughout each year between Hamburg and Birmingham I have become very disappointed with their service of late with regard to frequent flight schedule changes. These have occurred whether or not bookings have been made well in advance or at short notice. Despite accepting my bookings and payments for direct flights, they have changed my last few flight schedules multiple times to completely unsuitable indirect flights. These flights would have extended my journey time (which is usually one hour 20 mins flight) by between three and seven hours, if not more, due to the bad connections. I have had to repeatedly rearrange my plans and re-book flight dates and times which has sometimes resulted in me missing appointments / events. If the airline(s) wish to discontinue their direct flights between Birmingham / Hamburg they should not make them available to book and then withdraw them sometimes almost immediately after booking is confirmed. This has made me very reluctant to book further flights with Eurowings. I have emailed customer service about this several times over the past few months and am yet to receive a reply, just automatic acknowledgements. Only after my first email was submitted I was advised I would receive a reply within 6 weeks, which I find unacceptable. I have since found another airline that have re-introduced this route so my next flight on this route is already booked with them. Apart from this the I have found Eurowings flights are generally on time, check-in staff and on board service satisfactorary. Overall their flight schedules need to be more reliable and online customer service needs serious attention.",Detractor

Travelling from Edinburgh to Stockholm with a connection at Copenhagen. It was a poor experience altogether. Check-in at Edinburgh was a nightmare. We had to queue up for more than an hour even though we only had hand luggage to carry. No fast check-in was available and there were only 2 members of staff to assist a very busy flight. Both flights were delayed. The second flight (CPH-ARN) was delayed by almost 2 hours because we were waiting for the aircraft to come from Tel Aviv.

GVA-CDG on 22 August on an A319 and the in-flight service was as good as I have ever experienced. Friendly efficient and. for once clear PA announcements. The short flight was full and as is often the case one passenger could not read her seat allocation so a double seat allocation occurred which was quickly and pleasantly rectified by a member of all female cabin crew. Upon arrival in Paris I was in no hurry to disembark (unlike everyone else on board) so spent a little time chatting with the cabin crew and was even invited into the Flight Deck to meet the Captain and First Officer where the flown route was explained in some detail. All in all very pleasant and charming crew. The only minor complaint I would note is the lack of information on the ground in Geneva to explain a 45 minute delay.,Promoter

"  Varadero to Cologne with Eurowings. First time I used a low-cost company for a long-haul flight. Put it simply, avoid using low cost on long flights unless you have no other options. I knew the remarks / complaints about the company so I was well prepared and it fullfilled my expectations. First some good points: Check-in was very fast as well as the boarding. Departure on time and arrival in advance (great!). New equipement and safe feeling. Now the negative: Food: don't expect anything grandiose from it. Actually the cold meal is just 2 big bread slices with a thin layer of ham. The main complaint is that you would get something better for a cold meal you order on board. The thing is, you paid extra for this meal. Comfort: seats are in textile material which is not the most confortable for long flights and the maximum angle is limited. Cabin atmosphere was horrible. Relation with the cabin crew: so, so. That's the main problem with low-cost company, a seller-buyer feeling where the company wants the cuts the expenses at maximum while letting you pay for each extra. Premium economy (understand extra legroom) was a plus and corresponds with 34"" while standard seats are 30"" but there are some good seats among the standard economy seats with no seats in front (row 30 and row 4 in the A330-200). While it appears that the seat space was the same (for standard economy) as Ryanair seat it felt that there was more space. Also interesting to note we had to pay 100$ to get to the best class for the smart fare and 150$ for the basic fare. Interesting if you're hesitating for a best seat. I'm not sure however this stands for all flights. In the end I wouldn't recommend this company unless for short flights or if you don't have any other options. After the flight I regretted not to have booked a 15% more expensive flight with another company. However the basics are met, alive, on time and overall good logistics.",Passive

I went to the kitchen and asked for something else to eat according to my special dietary requirements but got the answer ""there is nothing for you to eat on this plane"" rather then getting offered simply for a piece of fruit or a packet of crackers. The person in front of me asked for a spare bottle of water but was declined. Finally I have got the impression from the cabin crew that I have to enjoy with what I have got because they were too busy and unwilling to offer any more than that.

There are wide selection of entertainment, movies and music on board. The 3D flight map is also available. As it is a flight bound for Seoul, Korea, the airline assigned Korean speaking crew.

"  New York to Oslo via Reykjavik. Don't fly this airline if you have baggage to check! First off, both flights to Norway were delayed several hours. I was notified of the second delay but not the first. Even though I had to go through customs my backpack did not get transferred between planes. Neith did the luggage for the 5-10 other people changing planes. The bag didn't arrive on the next plane which didn't arrive for another 8 hours late but took over 24 hours because the flight the next day was also over an hour late as the previous three had been. Customer service is also terrible. The customer service rep didn't know how to respond when I told her I didn't know where I was staying because they lost my bag which had my tent in it. She then suggested I continue on my trip hiking in the mountains without any gear and the airline would courier it to me even though she had no idea where my luggage was and when she'd have it. I've had to pay for a hotel, train fare, overage on the rental car and I missed one of the three hikes I had planned. They also failed to call me as promised that night by the specified time. When I tried to call back at the time they suggested I found out their office was closed for the night leaving me without any idea as to whether I'd get my backpack. It's been five weeks and I've yet to hear back from the airline regarding my claim. During the rest of my trip, I met a French couple that told me the airline was notorious for losing baggage, that it happened to their sister and when they found it, they compounded the problem by couriering it to the wrong place. I also stayed at a hostel in Iceland where a couple was waiting on their backpacks so they could do their hikes. For an airline that promotes stopovers with a picture of a tent on a mountain in their website, they do a horrible job of delivering.

We have just completed a round trip from the UK to USA two transatlantic flights and three internal flights. The first from London to Dallas was characterised by dreadful food (lunch being served immediately after an early morning take-off!) with very unfriendly and ungracious staff. The second flight from Dallas to El Paso was delayed for an hour at El Paso where we sat on the tarmac for an hour in temperatures of c.110F because of a failed air conditioning unit. Offered not so much as a glass of water. The delay meant that the car hire desk we were using was closed at El Paso. The second internal flight was from El Paso to Phoenix. This time the flight was delayed because the 'pontoon bridge' attaching the plane to the terminal was broken. Again we sat on the tarmac without refreshment. Again surly and uncooperative staff. We were sat at the back of the plane when drinks were finally offered there was very little choice left and no time to enjoy them. The third flight from Las Vegas to New York was relatively uneventful tho' with ungracious and charmless grumpy staff. The food on board was expensive terrible and tasteless. The final flight was delayed more than 2 hours at take off and just under two hours at landing. No staff would tell us what was going on the plane was changed and we were forced to split up our family seats and had to sit in different places on the plane. The food was inedible.

"  Mumbai to Istanbul. One of the worst experiences of our life has been this trip on Turkish Airlines. After booking a confirmed flight on 6th April we were offered one in which the connecting flight leaves 2 days earlier than we land. Thankfully we didn't select this by mistake. Then we were given a new itinerary which needed us staying overnight at Istanbul. We were then given a hotel room outside the airport which needed us to spend 220 USD on an express visa to enter Turkey plus an additional 100 USD on travel. The airline doesn't give you rooms in the airport, which turns out to be more expensive for the passenger as there is no proper public transport to our hotel room and Turkish won't pay for it. To make matters worse today the check in doesn't work and they've told us we need to reach early to the airport if we need good seats. Avoid this airline for its terrible customer service.",Detractor
"  I flew with Frontier several years ago and had a great experience. The flight prices were cheaper, but I don't remember feeling unsatisfied after my flights. Apparently the quality and customer assistance have gone way downhill in the past few years. My husband and I flew from Indianapolis to Las Vegas. The flight was fine, however, they nickel and dime you for every little thing, including water. The on-board flight staff were rude - one even yelling at a young child flying unaccompanied to ""clean up her mess"" and that ""she does not operate as a maid service"". The child had spilled some of her snack on the floor. She also had not parents to defend her. The flight attendant in question thought she was quite funny, making jokes the remainder of the flight, but I would like to say that her yelling at a young, unaccompanied minor was far from funny. The seats are uncomfortable and do not recline. There is no in-flight entertainment, which is fine. We were anticipating flying out the following week from Las Vegas, however, our flight was unexpectedly canceled only a couple hours before boarding time. No explanation was ever given as to why the flight was cancelled. Frontier left and entire plane full of people high and dry. The only 'help' offered was a refund of the flight plus travel vouchers OR up to $400 per person reimbursement for booking a new flight plus a small travel voucher. Sounds great, but honestly, the offer was trash. If you've never tried to book a flight the day of, flight prices are much higher than $400... especially when a plane full of people are all trying to book the same flights. Frontier so kindly offered to fly people out on Monday, but then mentioned that there was only 1 seat left (this occurred on a Saturday morning). At the time, when it became apparent that Frontier was not going to help anyone and people started to get angry, the staff members working the check in and baggages desks walked away and hid. They would not answer questions, they would not offer assistance. Eventually a couple came back out after the angry crowd died down and I was able to get some help. It was cowardly. I will never fly Frontier again, no matter how good the price or the flight times. It was an awful experience and I hope this review can save another person/couple/family from being stranded in an airport with no assistance offered by Frontier.",Detractor

Check-in and lounge experience were great, but once I got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are. There were seats with missing backs and 'Do Not Occupy' covers in front and beside them, random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead, and grimy, yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior. You have to worry about what's going on the important bits, like the engines, if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin. The crew spent as much time as they could in the galley, and interacted with passengers as little as possible. The breakfast service was a salt-infused hot cooked offering, and just one run of drinks. Anything else you wanted you had to use the call button.

"New York JFK to Las Vegas with Virgin America. I originally booked a Main Cabin Select seat for some added comforts to start my trip to Vegas nice and relaxed.

Checked in at the desk inside with nice agents. Priority boarding was nice. I had time to put stuff away and settle in before the rush of the remaining passengers. I had a drink prior to take off offered by professional and friendly staff. A great seat - I asked what the buttons were for on the armrest and it was for the seat massager. I used that all the way to Vegas (it put me to sleep pretty good twice). The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the food. I don't know why they had to get ""super fancy"" with it.

" Boston to Chicago. Do not fly United! There are other airlines more committed to their customer service, value and accommodations with similar prices. Disappointment after disappointment. Long story short things change and I ended up needing to change the time of my flight. Their policy is a 200 dollar change fee which was just as much as the ticket. I even purchased the misleading insurance just in case this might happen and they ONLY cover it if the airline changes or cancels... useless. Other airlines including southwest and jet blue have change fees as low as 60 and some free! So apparently they have a better handle on how to accommodate their flyers. Then I get to the airport and your only allowed one personal shoulder bag or purse, no carry on. I had the tiniest purse and had to check my 15 pound carry on. I didn't know Airlines don't allow carry ons these days. (I purchased the basic ticket which was not that much cheaper than other airlines. Had I known this I would have paid more for the ticket with another airline and wouldn't have to pay for a checked bag)I did not plan to check it and was supposed to change clothes for my destination to fit my busy schedule so was unable to do so.

Arrived on time in Athens but without luggage which was a ""pain in the neck!"" apparently due to operational issues. Fortunately we were headed directly to the Greek islands where a swimming costume is all you need. Luggage arrived within two days but Emirates flights on all sectors were a pleasure and you will use them again on my route next year.",Promoter
We booked a four-day trip to NYC. Got to the counter 45 minutes before flight. We couldn't print tickets at home and had trouble at the kiosk so our first surprise was $10 print fee per boarding pass. Second surprise was $47.50 for my husband's checked bag. Even though I had a carry-on the agent didn't mention there was a charge for this. We got a new employee who was training and it took her forever to process the boarding pass printing and checked bag. As we were walking away she said she forgot to charge us for the bag. She asked a co-worker how to call the gate because she didn't know how. I went ahead to the gate while my husband stayed to pay. About 15 minutes later I was called back to the counter. She had taken so long that the system released our tickets and they were given to standby customers. Even though it was 15 minutes before the flight we were told there was nothing they could do. There were already people in our seats. To make a long story short we spent over an hour trying to figure out all our options including buying new tickets on other airlines. The tickets on other airlines were too costly on short notice so we ended flying to Philadelphia on Spirit 7 hours later. Her error cost us an extra $115 for the train from Philly to NY. On our flight to Philly we learnt that I would also have to pay $50 for my carry-on. As we were boarding we were stopped because my boarding pass didn't show we paid for my carry-on. Even after we handed the gate agent our receipt for $97.50 for two bags she was still telling us the system didn't show we paid. Then she said I owed an additional $16. When we asked to speak to a supervisor he let us through. The additional baggage fees are ridiculous. These prices are so far off the industry standard that they should post the prices as part of the check out so the customer knows all fees up front.,Detractor
We arrived in London Gatwick for our 13.35 flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed 6 hours and would not take off until 19.00 so we asked to move/change our connecting flight from Dubai (knowing that we would have missed it for sure) but were told multiple times that it could not be done in the UK but it would have been done quickly in Dubai airport transfer desk. When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. Definitely would not recommend also Airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 2/3 hours.,Detractor
LHR to Calgary: Check in at brand new T2 was a complete shambles - not sure if this is AC's problem or T2 teething troubles? Not enough staff around to deal with self check-in problems and only 2 check in desks available - the queue was long and slow! On board in Economy seat pitch and leg room was pretty good for 2 adults and 1 child. Everything else distinctly average. Return leg Vancouver to LHR Premium Economy: Self check in worked fine but bag drop slow and everyone in the same queue with not one AC rep on the airport floor in sight. Seats in Premium OK. Flight delayed for around an hour due to them being unable to get the door closed. Inflight service really poor - food was absolutely dire and meal of choice had run out even before we'd left the ground. Flight attendants completely lacking in attentiveness - no rubbish collection despite me having a nice tidy little bag full of bits which I deliberately left in sight. Even as we came in to land it got missed on their final cabin check. Missed drinks/coffee runs - there was definitely a preferred customer system in operation - fine we may not be frequent flyer members (and never will be!) but we've still paid a premium fare and shouldn't be completely overlooked. Baggage reclaim at LHR T2 a mess - again not sure if this is AC's problem but surely LHR should know what they're doing by now? All in all both Air Canada and LHR's shiny new T2 have disappointed. Not sure we'll be able to avoid using T2 again in the future but certainly we will not be choosing AC again.,Detractor

On the website of the WizzAir everybody can get to know all of the information about baggage, flights, the level of the service and the selection of the drinks and food available on purchase. With this clearly well known knowledge in my opinion WizzAir is the best low-cost company in Europe. For the price of a bus ticket they gave me a lift to London - that is all what I had paid. The cabin is new and clean, the safety is high and the cabin crew is one of the kindests. For 23 Euros it is heaven.",Passive
TK60 from IST to KUL in economy. Food and beverage service was as good as the food itself definitely 4-star standard. However the crew had a new trick which I have not seen before: One of the two front lavatories was reserved for crew use. It was clearly visible from my seat that the crew locked the door from the outside after they were finished using it. Reducing the number of lavatories on a plane is not a good idea. To add insult to injury the crew never bothered to clean the passenger lavatory resulting in an abundance of overflowing sewage. Wrote to the airline and did not receive any type of response. I recommend taking rubber boots on your next TK flight.,Detractor

"  Chicago to Las Vegas. While, Spirit on the surface, seemed like a good choice, it was just that, on the surface. My husband and I decided to go on a last minute honeymoon to Las Vegas. While, our flights were reasonable I was horrified at the cost of luggage. Fine, we decided to just check one bag, and avoid the carry on totally to cut down the price. The scale at Spirit said ""53 pounds"". We were hit with an additional fee of $55.00. We could have checked another entire bag for less than the overage fee. While I was upset, hey if its overweight, its overweight. Same items in the same bag just a few days later, we return home on American and wouldn't you know my bag was 9 pounds lighter only ""43 pounds"" I don't have words for how mad I was. Granted, we still would have be subjected to an overage fee through Spirits 40 pound limit, but it would have been $20 cheaper. All scales differ, but I am not buying a 9 pound difference on domestic flights. No drinks served on the plane, no nothing for a 3 hr plane ride. All together we paid well over $300, for totally nothing. Never again Spirit, never again. I'll book more in advance & fly Southwest since they care about their customers.",Detractor

" Melbourne to Los Angeles via Auckland. The check-in staff at the Melbourne airport was new and inexperienced and took over 1 and a half hours to check our bags in. There were no complications. We did not have excess luggage. Our US visas were in order. We did not get the seats we booked 6 months in advance. We wanted to sit together but the system has changed our seats. Now we weren't sitting together. When we boarded our flight from MEL to AKL it was an old Singapore Airlines B777-200 aircraft with Singapore Airlines furniture but old and dirty. There were many things missing like food, menu card etc. The cabin crew thought it was okay and it was funny. They were cracking jokes and laughing the whole time when we who paid a lot of money did not find it funny at all! The AKL-LAX and LAX-AKL-MEL sectors were good. Awesome free wifi on all these sectors except the MEL-AKL flight. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Food was average. The amenity kit was good. Entertainment system was above average. Flights were on time. The pursers came up to me and thanked me and wished me a pleasant stay at the end of all the flights. The cabin crew who served came up to me introduced themselves and welcomed me at the beginning of all the flights. The Air New Zealand lounges were lovely and clean and the food was good except the Star Alliance Lounge in LAX. It was so crowded and busy like a fish market and the food was disgusting.",Passive

My husband and I flew from Phoenix AZ to Dallas TX on Spirit Airlines. We purchased 2 one way tickets separately leaving from Phoenix then returning from Dallas back to Phoenix. It was cheaper this way. The tickets in total were $336 which was great but paid another $66 going for a checked bag and seat assignments. Returning was even worse! This time 1 carry on $45 and 1 checked bag $35. Then when we got to the airport it was another $25 for the checked bag so in total $110 for bags. So in total for this trip it cost $512. I advise anyone to steer clear of this airline due to all of the extra charges. Low airfares yes however they make up for it in so many other ways. The leg room was horrible and the seats don't recline at all. It was an extremely unpleasant flight.,Detractor

Allocated seats together (2 passengers) given at online check in, with no need to change these. Pleasant and courteous staff member at baggage drop. Boarding by cabin class and row numbers and ran pretty smoothly. Boeing 777 about 16 years old, but still in presentable condition. I'm 1.8 m. tall and medium build and I found the seat pretty comfortable for a 12-hour flight in economy - at least this aircraft type is still 9 abreast despite the slightly dated look of the cabin. Not the largest seat screen I've experienced but fine, and there was a reasonable selection of movies, tv and music. Drinks service followed by hot meal (roast chicken in sauce or veggie option). We ate in the terminal before departing just in case the food offering was going to be dire, but despite the reduction in food given on the tray we couldn't really fault what was provided. Lights out after dinner until about an hour before landing when a hot breakfast was served. Cabin crew friendly and efficient service, with water service through the night, plus option to get drinks from the galley. Landed on time.

Just completed a LHR to DUB round trip on flexi tickets which is the nearest you can get to Business class on Aer Lingus. Loved the lounges at both ends uncrowded and stylish. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Great in flight magazine. The new Terminal 2 at DUB is a delight. But the aircraft's are very cramped the flight out was completely full and I felt very trapped even being on the front row. The lack of proper inflight catering brings the on board service down combined with the cramped seat pitch and no free on board catering creates a no fills feel. Even if you pay and pre order a meal on a flexi ticket you lose it if you change your time. Surely modern IT could cope with re-assigning it.,Passive

Regular on MXP-BUD-MXP route. All the journey apart from one leg were on time. The aircraft's are quite new and clean. If you're lucky you can get the plane with slim seats: it will entitle you to a decent legroom otherwise with the old ones is simply inhuman. In my opinion that's the only bad point of this airline. The rules about hand luggage are not easy but once familiar is possibly to cope with. The ground staff in this respect in MXP are very tolerant while in BUD are strict and rude. If booked in advance the fares are really good and the overall service is acceptable and better than Ryanair's.

My wife and I booked a flight through last minute.com it was really a last minute thing because we had to be in Auburn by the 22nd August 2014. We got a flight for the 21st August which involved a couple of stops. The flight was from Birmingham UK stopping at Newark NJ and then at Washington Dulles then Syracuse (outgoing). First the flight was supposed to leave Birmingham at 09.00hrs that left 3 hrs late due to technical trouble. Got to Newark NJ so late we missed the 14.50 connection to Washington Dulles. They then booked us on another flight from Newark to Syracuse that was leaving at 21.04hrs that never turned up until about 22.30 and because there was a little downpour of rain the flight was delayed it had never left Attica. We went out on to the tarmac to board the plane and was confronted with a plane that looked like something from the Fred Flinstone era. This was a tiny DHC8 turbo prop plane and we were buffeted around like a roller coaster. So for that trip we were delayed for about 12 hours. Not even a cup of tea or a glass of water was offered to the passengers. The way back was even worse we were supposed to leave Syracuse at 19.10hrs on the 2nd September 2014. Next thing you know the rain started to fall again flight cancelled for 24 hours. We had to spend our own money for a one night stay in a hotel. So instead of going from Syracuse to Washington to Brussels to Birmingham we now had to go from Syracuse to Washington to Dublin then Birmingham.

" Frankfurt to Nashville via Charlotte/Philadelphia. Though American Airlines doesn't get much credit on this site, our trip worked out fine. We had 4 flights with them and all were bang on time. I like the fact that AA flies in Frankfurt from the much quieter terminal 2. We were recevied by very friendly groundstaff and had our bag dropped within 15 mins. AA holds firmly to the boarding-by-group system which I like very much. The flight from Frankfurt to Charlotte was good: a rather tasty meal and plenty of drinks and snacks. We only had 1,5 hour connection time to Nashville, so we were a bit weary about that, because you have tot go through immigration and collect your bag again and go through security again, but is was okay. Airport staff is ready tot take your bag immediately from you after immigration so you can rush through security. By the time we got tot the gate boarding began and again we had a very punctual departure for Nashville. Small snack and a drink on this one-hour flight was enough. Checking in in Nashville for our inbound flight again was a breeze. Again very friendly ground staff (we've experienced different before!) and within 10 mins we were at the gate. Flight from Nashville to Philadelphia took only 1,5 hours in stead of the advertised 2 hours and 10 mins and that was good since we had only 50 mins connecting time in Philadelphia. Still quite a run because we arrived at B10 and our plane to Frankfurt was at the furthest gate (A26). By the time we arrived we were almost the last ones to board. Our son wasn't assigned a seat in Nashville but his boarding pass with seat was ready in Philadelphia. Four the fourth time a very punctual departure. Again a meal, rather bland but okay and plenty of drinks and snacks. Breakfast -well, sort of- an hour for landing. 280 films and games to choose from. Crew over all not very friendly but never unfriendly. In less than seven hours to Frankfurt, landed almost an hour earlier. All in all a very good experience. Would definitely fly again.",Promoter

Full flat bed on a long lasting night flight was welcome, even if being a hard one for European standards. Crew was always present and fully ready for servicing, until the last minute.",Promoter
BKK-ICN-LAX. Business Class. Absolutely inferior hard product (seat) compared with competition offerings. This old 777 had Business class seats that would only angle recline (not 180' lie flat). The seats were narrow seat back bolsters were malfunctioning and overall caution material was hard and uncomfortable for such a long flight. The cabin was kept uncomfortably warm for the entire flight despite requests to lower the temp. The food and beverage offered was average. IFE was ok. Service was good not great.

I was pleasantly surprised. Airlines business cabin is far superior to BA. There is far more room in the seat for storage and shelf space as well as small pockets to stow a mobile whilst charging. The seat is far more private and the kit bag is much better too. I was on a seat near the galley, which was a little noisy so don't reserve a seat too close to the galley on a night flight.

They accommodated special requests readily and English was universally spoken, smiles all around. The seat pitch on both 777 and 747 seemed better than most economy classes, I slept well. Slippers were provided. On the 747 upper deck window seats, storage lockers between the seat and fuselage are a nice convenience. Food was good to excellent, served with very firm and usable plastic cutlery. The ginger fish and pork and rice were the most memorable dishes. The only disappointment was the in-seat technology. No charging available, the entertainment system screen was smallish, felt very 2005. Movies and TV on the system would inexplicably cut out sometimes. The flight tracker played a loop of views showing the total fight path, then current location, etc, rather than being controlled by the user to see what you want. The entertainment selection was reasonably good, and classical music from the Evergreen Symphony orchestra was nice. Bathrooms were among the cleanest and nicest I've seen in economy class. I would recommend EVA highly, Taipei is a nice airport for transfers as well.",Promoter
"I am disappointed with Turkish Airlines. Long bus ride to airplane at Istanbul airport. Lack of usual Business Class priority on bus ride and other services. Don't know why need a flight chef when my food was not acceptable. IFE Screen not working from Istanbul to HK. Lost my luggage on flight from Istanbul to Vienna, and forgot to put priority tags on my luggage. Flight Attendants talk loudly in middle of the night which woke me up. Istanbul Airport is too big, too many people and signage is so poorly provided. Business Class seat configuration 2+3+2 is poorly designed. I have to climb over my next person in order go to washroom.",Detractor
We sat on the tarmac at Newark for an hour and a half. Same thing on the way home to the USA. But I don't blame the airline for that. The service was good food was good and processing through to the plane was as efficient as could be expected. I don't have any real complaints. I guess it's that I don't expect to be catered to on airplanes anymore unless I'm in business or first class. My overall experience was positive. It seems like its a good airline and it's well run.,Promoter
I had no idea what Air Canada Rouge was until after I had booked. We found a good deal online from YVR to HON for spring break so booked. Flight was on time leaving YVR and aircraft seemed clean and tidy but seats were a bit cramped in terms of leg room and elbow room. The flight attendants were all very friendly and bubbly as one would expect from new grads - I liked the attempt to look trendy with the uniforms. What was disappointing though for my two young children was that there was no in-flight entertainment. It would have been helpful to know that one needed the iPad app ahead of time. Also disappointing the lack of good available - you would think Mac and cheese would be the obvious to stock up on this flight. What was extremely disappointing was to find out the day of checkout was that our 10.15pm flight had been delayed by 4 hours. What was even more aggravating was to find out through 3 further emails that our flight was delayed even more. The final straw that broke the camel's back was to check in and then find out that our flight would be delayed 7.45 hours. So here I am sitting in Honolulu airport writing this in frustration at 4am because I can't sleep and have two exhausted children on hand. Had we known this earlier we would have just booked a hotel room. What I find insulting is the airline's idea of compensation for this is $10 meal vouchers - what a slap in the face. On top I find it ironic that the airline is 7.45hours delayed which is just under 8 hours on their website for which they would provide accommodations for. I'm sitting here in the airport probably with 100+ passengers looking as exhausted and frustrated as I am and probably thinking the same thing - never again. As I peruse the Internet wish I found this website earlier as I hear this is not the first time this has happened.,Detractor
 Seoul Incheon to Hong Kong in November 2017. Seoul Airport check in is convenient. A330-300 was deployed for this route. The flight announcement was made in English and Korean. This aircraft comes with the newer generation of CX studio. In flight entertainment with a wide selection of movies and songs are available and the 3D flight map. Breakfast was served followed by hot beverages. The standard of the in flight catering is slightly better in view of the catering was uploaded from Seoul. The flight was enjoyable.

The servers were very professional and efficient and the planes were good. Our flight out of St. Petersburg was a disaster due to the lack of communication and inattentive flight representatives. We were booked on a 6.30 am flight to Moscow and were finally rebooked for a 2.40 pm flight. We were at the airport at 4 am and the plane left at 3 pm - that's 11 hrs in the airport.

The over- night stopover in Seoul was a pleasure - very efficiently organised at both the airport and the hotel. My only grumble would be with the inflight food which was both boring and tasteless.

Flew Premium Economy from HK to London in my opinion it is not worth the extra and does not live up to the promise of better food choices and wines etc. One choice of wine not a choice of several meals but just two. For toilets you have to go back to economy and wait in a queue. Seats were good but not several hundred dollars worth of good. Staff on this flight were good. We got caught up in the Tropical Cyclone Usagi debacle little information and a useless website. For an airline that says that customer service is a priority it has let itself down badly.,Passive

"I was hesitant to book this airline going to Osaka due to the negative reviews here but it was the cheapest option. To my surprise, me and family did not have any negative experiences a lot of other commenters had. I'm 5'10 and found the seats to have average legroom just like any other airline I've flown. The crew were professional, helped out immediately when someone needed it, and served with a smile. The food to me was good, obviously not restaurant fancy, but good and filling. Drinks and bottled water, not tap, was offered every now and then. Although there is no screen in front of you to provide you with in-flight entertainment or location, they have an app that you can download on your Apple or Android where you can access some good movies from. I had no problem connecting to it and it kept me entertained for the long flight. Overall, I would fly with them again.",Promoter

I had not flown Etihad and booked Sydney - Rome return without viewing the reviews. A few days before flying I did read the reviews and was horrified and really worried! However on both outward and inward trips I can say that apart from the lack of legroom (this is true) I was pleasantly surprised by the cabin crew who were both friendly and efficient the meal choice the inflight entertainment and the on ground services. The seat itself was comfortable and I managed to sleep (it's a gruelling 14 hour flight). Apart from the narrow legroom I cannot fault this airline. It may not be the best but it's OK and well-priced.,Passive
"  Flew from Dallas Fort Worth to Chicago. I guess there's something called ""shabby chic"" in air travel, since the aircraft was in ramshackle condition. The partitions had foam insulation surrounding the edges. The window frames were literally falling off. The bottoms of the luggage containers had smears, showing they hadn't been cleaned in ages. Talk about deferred maintenance, and this was the first class cabin. The flight crew matched the apathy of the maintenance guys, as people boarded they holed up in the galley to chat, and never went through the cabin. American Airlines you can do better.",Detractor

"  Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Dallas Fort Worth on January 14, 2017, in Economy. I would describe my experience as mediocre, a C in terms of classroom grades. The plane left Toronto about 45 minutes late, since the plane arrived with a delay from MontrÃ©al. There was no apology from Air Canada. The plane was completely full. There was, however, sufficient room in the overhead lockers, as ground staff had warned people to check large pieces (free of charge at the gate, at check-in, my suitcase was 35 CAD). Seating is very tight on the Embraer 175, when the person in front of me reclined his seat, there were about 10 inches from my head to the top of his seat. Thus, the three-hour flight was pretty uncomfortable. Likewise, when I used the bathroom at the back of the plane, I found that I could not fully stand up (I am 6'1""). For service, the cabin crew came through once with soft drinks",Detractor

"I was switched to Rouge after booking a business class ticket on a regular Air Canada flight to Phoenix. The Rouge version of business class is shocking. It is the same small uncomfortable seats in economy but they do not book the middle seat. There is little to no overhead storage and people in business class ended up having their bags stored in economy which made disembarking a delayed and frustrating experience. This month Air Canada ""rouged"" me again by switching a business class flight I had booked to Hawaii. We demanded - and received - a full refund. I will never ever fly Rouge again and I will make every effort to avoid Air Canada in general.",Detractor
"  Prague to Larnaca via Warsaw. Prague to Warsaw on small Dash 8 which is ok, but in some days they operate this route by E175 which I would prefer. Plane had been delayed over and hour because of the weather which wasn't huge problem since I had 3 hours layover. We received small choolade bar and glass of water, for anything else you had to pay. One hour before my flight I've found out that second flight will be delayed as well almost 2 hours. It started with boarding, there were two lines, one for economy and second for business and with small children. Since there was a problem with some passangers at the economy line they opened second one. It was ok, until it was time for me, than group of 20 people with 3 kids came and they let me wait until they were processed (like it was only me and I got EU passport), so I had to squiezed myself into second line, but still like 30 people passed me. I boarded this old Boeing 737-400 (it's time to retire them), agian in some days this route is operated by E175, but unlucky again. Seat pitch in this plane is terrible, seats are new, but not confortable, only plus is that they have sockets so you can power up your phone. Cabin crew wasn't really great and they were not friendly. Only thing you've got for free was glass of water and chocolade bar which is not ok, on 3 hours and 30 minutes long flight, plus selection of meals that I can buy was really limited and not really tasty. Like it's not budget airline and even though I said this flight was only not supper expensive option it wasn't cheap either. Of course no IFE, screens or Wifi. So I cannot recomend this airline, I will fly with them only if I have no better option.",Detractor
Flew Cork-Nice return recently. Outward flight was fine and on time. Food on flight was quite poor and bad value. Aer Lingus seemed to have changed caterers. Return flight was a shambles. All passengers were boarded on time and the pilot announced that all was ready with just some paperwork to complete which would take just a few minutes. Time passed slowly and the minutes mounted up. After about 15 minutes the pilot said that there was a slight problem and he was waiting for an engineer to sort things out. The engineers duly arrived and were to be seen examining so instruments in the cockpit. They left and returned a number of times and the cabin crew did their best to reassure the passengers and were unable to begin catering of any sort because of customs regulations. After about and hour a supervisor went to the cockpit and some more examining of instruments continued. The pilot said at this stage that there was a fuel gauge problem and after about another 15 mins he announced that the problem had been satisfactorily solved. So one and a half hours late we departed.,Passive

Hope you ate before you got on board or brought your own snack because you won't be getting a crumb from this airline. Maybe they should have saved money by not buying fedoras for the airline crew.

It's now over 3 months since my luggage was lost I still haven't heard anything conclusive and was told 4 weeks ago that they were still investigating.

" Delhi to Mumbai via Indore. After landing in DEL, as the airline had provided a very tight connecting flight from Delhi to Mumbai as a result of which that connection was missed. So the airline staff, had provided an alternate connecting flight but this was via Indore which added up to the travel time which was not exactly ideal. What was surprising was that the airline did not have any connecting flights to Mumbai from Delhi between 9am till 3pm. Because Delhi to Mumbai is usually such a trunk route that there are enough flights. So this was not very good. During the checkin of the flight, the check-in agent was very helpful and told us about the status of the flight including the seat availability and other details which was really helpful. The flight in itself was slightly delayed due to connecting passengers from Srinagar. From Delhi to Indore a light snack featuring a sandwich and a drink were provided which was good. After landing in Indore, we had to sit inside the aircraft as the servicing was done and other passengers joined in. For the remaining Indore-Mumbai leg, again a snackbox was provided and arrival was 30 mins delayed which was not preferable. It seems that Air India's international product is fabulous but on the domestic sector there can be improvements with regards to the frequency of flights / flight delays. The flights were pretty decent. Would recommend but would expect more connections and frequencies of flights because I had to wait almost 5 hours to get my connecting flight back to Mumbai and that also with a stopover.",Passive

 Tampa to Santo Domingo. This was my first and last flying with Spirit. The plane was small and outdated. The seats are uncomfortable. They don't offer you not even a cup of water. You have to pay for all bags including carry on. If you don't buy your luggage at the time you purchase the ticket you pay almost double the fee. If you have even 1Lb over in you very highly charged luggage you have to pay $100. I travelled with my toddler who has a stroller and they do not accommodate you at all.

"JFK to LHR - Despite the image the BA TV show conveyed The Galleries Lounges at JKF is the worst run of all the BA Lounges I have visited. I have had more polite service at Macdonalds than at the desk in the Galleries. There was nothing business class or tranquil about the space. The spa was a fully booked with no appointments for two hours and ""the sorry we can't be of service today"" was more than disappointing especially given the Â£6K ticket price and the message was delivered with such insincerity. How can BA get it so right offering 1st Class service in London Miami Boston Seattle Hong Kong and Sydney (to name a few) and offer budget airline service with a mediocre selection of sandwiches in JFK. Boarding was a mess. They were boarding a Qantas flight at the adjacent gate and all the passengers got mixed up. We asked a BA member of ground staff where to queue and she said she did not know and it had nothing to do with her! First and Business class passengers were directed down a cul-de-sac marked fast track which came to a dead end in a sea of passengers and eventually all the premium passengers joined the line behind the economy passengers and boarded last. We ask ""why"" as the lady gave us back our boarding cards and she said ""nothing to do with me"". Upstairs on the 747 in Club was excellent professional attentive staff good food and wine good entertainment BA at its best the only flaw was no menu cards because of a mistake at JFK no surprise.

The food is normally good, the lounge in Istanbul is excellent, but their service is deteriorating by the day. Old, dirty seats, no priority boarding, no access to lounges in smaller airports, finally they didn't load my special meal. When I complained through their online customer service system they were not apologetic, but on the contrary tried to justify and explain every fault. Moreover, delays of anywhere between 15-45 minutes are a normal occurrence. They don't even bother apologizing to customers. It's almost perceived as something totally acceptable.

" I heard about all the bad reviews, now I know why. After a wonderful Labor Day weekend wedding, we were delayed in Boston by 30 minutes to catch a Spirit connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale. Arrived at Ft. Lauderdale, ran to the gate to catch the flight to Atlanta, and was told the plane left 10 minutes ago. Spirit left us there. I mean dropped us off in Florida, and left us to fend for ourselves. I asked why the plane wouldn't wait. The agent said, â€œwe have to leave on timeâ€. There were plenty of flights that I was on that the pilot informed us that he was going to wait for some passengers that were delayed on another flight. Spirit delayed our flight in Boston and left us knowing we were on that flight. Told us the next flight out was in 2 days and we would have to wait. Eventually, after calling security on us, needless to say I was just a little upset, they gave us a 40% discount for some hotel. A hotel in Ft. Lauderdale for $90.00 before the discount? I will say this tho, they left our baggage. They took our bags off the plane because they knew we were coming in on a delayed Spirit flight, to catch a Spirit connecting flight, and that we wouldn't be landing on time. Their demeanor was cold and uncaring. That blew me away too! Our flight landed at 10:30 PM or so and by 12:40 I decided to bite the bullet and rent a car. I called Enterprise, told him of our dilemma, and he said they close at 1:00 but will wait. Those people were wonderful! They got us car in no time flat and we were on our way. Drove thru the night and got to the Atlanta Airport to get my car at 11 in the morning. So if you decide to chance it, Have a Ball! BTW, baggage fees were $45.00 each way for each bag online.

We checked with staff in Toronto that we didn't need to collect our bags for our connection which they confirmed. Lo and behold our bags didn't arrive as we'd been told.

QF36 Economy Singapore to Melbourne on 15 Feb 2014. Full flight owing to the start of the Australian university term. Huge difference from the superior A380 that used to ply this route - seats on the A330-300.were old IFE sets small and mine was not working properly for some reason. Upgrades are needed quickly lest Qantas loses out to other airlines on this route. Supper and breakfast service was ok nothing special. Cabin crew professional throughout. Coffee was atrocious. Arrived in Melbourne on time and bags on the luggage belt within half an hour. All in all decent service but could be much better. If you're flying from Southeast Asia Qantas is ok if you they have a good deal for tickets but if you're paying full fare it would be better to stick to Singapore Airlines.,Passive
"I flew a round trip from Detroit to LAX with a connecting flight each way. There was a delay for all of the 4 planes I flew on, and on the way there, there was a 2 hour delay. On the way back, there was a 1 hour delay and we sat in the plane while they fixed the air conditioning, and it was incredibly hot. I understand that they had to fix the plane's air conditioning, but they should have done that before we got on the plane and had to sit in that heat for an hour. Then I missed my connecting flight, and I got on a new flight (after talking to a very rude lady at customer service), and that flight was delayed because they didn't have any flight attendants for that plane, so they had to wait over an hour until they could get a new flight crew to come. I had an absolutely miserable experience with United for all 4 of my flights with them, and I will never fly with United again.",Detractor

AMS-PEK and CAN-AMS. I ordered Kosher meal but I'm not Jewish which seemed to be a relief to the FAs concerning the heating and handling of the meal. Meal itself on AMS-PEK was made in UK but not completely defrosted yet and not that tasty. CAN-AMS was made in China and much better. All came in a plastic box inside plastic foil with seal and cardboard. Downsides: Black coffee had to be prepared on request no diet/zero Coke or even soda. Great service by all of the flight attendants! Although not all speak perfect English they try very much to help. I even could get a few leftover meals (garbage anyway) for my layovers. Seats were quite nice as well headrest moveable up and down and sides could be set up to keep the head from flapping to the sides.,Promoter

First, although I had a confirmed tickets many many months ahead each of us (me, wife and two children) had to sit in a different seat even the little kids (7 and 10 years). Seating was a total chaos. I asked for a tea and they said 10 AED for each me and my wife. I paid it then they handed us the packs with no cup or water. We thought they will give us that but when they didn't we asked and was shocked to hear that we had to pay another 10 AED each for hot water to drink the tea we just order.

The Dreamliner flight from Sydney to Delhi was a disappointment. 1) Seats were very cramped. Not adequate leg space for such a long flight. 2) Toilets were dirty and toilet tissues were not replaced. 3) The entire economy seating area smelt. 4) A snack and a drink was very much needed before landing. Just two meals for a 13 hour flight was not adequate. 5) Fruit juice and diet drinks were not available after the first meal service. 6) A wet wipe or steamed towel should have been provided at the end of such along flight.

"Doha to Los Angeles via Frankfurt. Lufthansa has added a stop in Kuwait on the way to FRA presumably to fill seats since it has competition on this route from Qatar Airways A350. The A330-300 from Doha was very comfortable and food much better than the longer flight to LAX. This is an extra journey with layover and takes over 25 hours. The bathrooms in the A380 behind row 15 are small and spartan for business class. At six per row, the seats are not that wide and you get reasonably intimate with total strangers. In spite of all the fuss about new menu based on flyer preferences, the offerings were nothing to crow about. Portions tend to me on the cuisine minceur size. Snacks came about midflight and consisted of small servings. When I asked if could have two, ""just choose one now, we may not have enough,"" was the reply. Two minutes later an extra snack was handed. There was no announcement about a bar on the upper deck or snacks/fruits available in the galley. WIFI was available but not free in business class. It was easy to use and reasonably fast. In spite of the little glitches, Lufthansa has the best FA's in the industry.

While traveling from Mexico to SAT my wife and I decided to give Southwest our first try we travel about 3 to 4 times out of DSM and we had never used your services.

"  Las Vegas to St. Louis via Denver. Will never fly Frontier Airlines again. I have used a lot of airlines in my lifetime, but Frontier was the worst, by far. Arriving at the airport they charged us for our luggage (40-45.00/per bag). That alone put us over the amount offered by competitors. Plus they charged us again on the way back! We were going to use the kiosk to check in, but they said we would still have to wait in the enormously long line (1 hr). We get on the flight and the seats are like lawn chairs, and they don't recline! The serving cart comes down the aisle and we find out that we have to pay for everything but a small cup of water. On our return flight there is a delay (2 hrs). We arrive at our stop-off in Denver to catch our connecting flight, but that flight leaves 15 mins before we arrive. We go to the customer service desk and they tell us that our flight from Las Vegas wasn't delayed and that we just missed the flight. I tell them it was delayed by two hours. Finally, after two hours of waiting at the desk till midnight, they admit that the flight we just took was delayed. They tell us that there isn't another flight until the following evening, but that was booked. Finally, the shift supervisor shows up and gets us on the flight the next evening and gives us a voucher for a room at a hotel. Of course the following day we have to be out of our room at 11am, so we have to find somewhere to hang out until that evening when the flight leaves. The food vouchers are only good at the airport and they are for 10 and 15 dollars which doesn't go far at an airport eatery. Plus we have to pay for cab fare from the hotel to the airport to use them, and that is about 15 miles away. We finally get on the flight the next evening and sit on the tarmac for an hour so that they can de-ice the plane (1 hr). Of course we arrive late in St. Louis and wait another hour for our luggage. This is the worst run airline I have ever used. The trays are the size of an iPad, the seats are about as uncomfortable as you can get. The pilots were good, despite the horrible weather coming into St. Louis, and the attendants were good too. That is the only good thing I can say.",Detractor

This is just a small reflection of the terrible service. This is a 15 hour flight. There were only 2 meal services during this whole time. About 2 hours after take off and 2 hours before landing. Be prepared to go hungry. During the 11 hour interval between meals there was not a single time when the beverage cart appeared. I had to find a flight attendant and ask for a cup of water.

Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight.

"Austrian is my favourite airline to cross the Atlantic. I like Vienna airport for it is small, efficient and convenient. Austrian Airlines is exactly the same. On this 8+ hour night flight from Toronto to Vienna I had a very memorable experience. Because of the change of equipment from what I expected, I ended up sitting in row 7 which has no window. I wasn't happy! But since it was a night flight and I was going to sleep for most of it I thought I won't make a fuss. During dinner service, when the flight attendant asked me if everything was OK, I said yes, adding that it would be great if she could do something about the missing window - jokingly. Well, when I woke up in the morning I look up, and on the wall where the window was supposed to be I had a painting of a window with a beautiful sunrise drawn on it in vibrant colours. Along with a very sweet note from the flight attendant that was serving me. Made my flight! That is attention to detail. Although Austrian doesn't have the newest planes (Boeing 767-300) and the latest latest business class product, it's very solid, with great service and some of the best inflight catering I've ever had. I actually look forward to all my meals that are prepared by the onboard chef. To end, there is the substantial Austrian coffee menu, which I adore. I love flying with Austrian!",Promoter

"ZRH-PVG (Shanghai) on an A343 fully booked in the ""upper classes"" (maybe as well in economy but I could not verify). Plane clean and well maintained ""full flat seats"" but my aisle seat was open in the very front thus the feet could easily slip to the right and collide with the people moving in the aisle. Window seats do not have this risk. Departure with a minimal delay arrival about 20 minutes late due to ""avoiding Russian airspace"" thus taking the Southern route over Turkmenistan Kazakstan and entering Chinese airspace West of Urumqi - this is altogether a flight time of one additional hour. Meal service consisted of a late lunch and an early breakfast almost at sunrise over Central China - both with good choices good quality - just good European business class standard but also taking Asian tastes into consideration (two of the four meal choices can be called Asian dishes). Beverage selection ok no ""high class wines"" - one Swiss white and red each plus three additional European varieties. The result is probably similar to my choices if someone would ask me to suggest five reasonable wines giving me a strict budget plus the must of choosing two Swiss ones. Thus I do not complain but enthusiasm sounds different AVOD is not my topic - I just follow the airshow read dine and take a nap. Once again a pleasant flight on Swiss but I wish they could have a slightly less strict budget on beverages and inflight magazines.",Promoter

Both the legs were delayed by 1.5 hrs which was very disappointing, especially SAS being Europes most punctual airline. No refreshments offered to compensate delay. Their European product is very basic to a point that it can be easily compared with that of easyJet minus free tea or coffee, even that is now offered only one per passenger and for late evening flight they are replaced by small toffee. The only saving grace for SAS are thier friendly crew and updates from cabin. I suggest SAS to relax its policy on serving drinks so that passengers feel bit more welcome, after a hard working day.

I flew Air Canada Rouge for the first time last week (YYZ to Honolulu) - it was the worst flight I have ever taken and I fly frequently. The seats were extremely small/cramped and at 6'1 I had nowhere near enough room. I was surprised how many seats they crammed onto an old 767. The staff were not very helpful or courteous and with no seatback display system we had to use our own device to access entertainment via wifi. Most of the people seated around me didn't realize that you needed to download the Air Canada Rouge app beforehand and they were out of luck (or had to rent one of their tablets). I was able to use my phone to connect but there was no wifi access for the first hour of the flight and it was intermittent at best afterwards with frequent dropouts and long waits for reconnections. The tablet concept does not work. I am disappointed that AC has transitioned/downgraded many of their holiday destinations to Rouge service and will be looking to alternatives i.e. West jet.

"Flight #5953 - Kansas City snow storm of Dec. 17th. Flight was to depart at 5:22 pm. Delay, delay, delay then cancelled shortly before 8:00 pm. The lines of people at the gates were long and moving very slowly as people were trying to get other flights and airlines arrangements. At 8 pm an announcement that the agents at the gates had to leave for the day, as they had completed their shifts.....all hell broke loose as people began running from the lines out to the ticket counters in the terminal to be closer to the front of the long line. There was about 200 people in line for one agent. Other airline's planes were leaving, but not United's. It was communicated to the passengers that the one de-icing truck United had for Kansas City had broken a line and was inoperable. So, without de-icing, no flying. A neighboring airline had 4 de-icing trucks, however, three of those were broken so United couldn't borrow one. Really, in Kansas City, no contingent plan for snow other than one truck. Waiting in a line that wasn't moving, called customer service to reissue tickets on a different flight. We were told no planes were going to fly out the next day, Sunday, but they could get us on a Monday morning flight. The employee lied to get us off the phone and move on to someone else, by just scheduling us on an easy flight without having to do research of flights that would get us home sooner. However, we took the scheduling and headed to the bank of hotels to find a place for two nights. At the hotel we did our own rescheduling and found a flight for Sunday on another airline, American and Mesa through Phoenix, AZ, at 5:50 pm. These also, were delayed and finally left KC, MO at 8 pm. United's service is very poor, we did not get our upgraded seats we paid for, nor have they offered when we asked for compensation.

"I flew with Lufthansa for a connection flight the duration of which was likely no more than 3-4 hours it was a short-haul flight.

But at the end of the day I paid for my flight and frankly it is no business of a flight attendant what passengers do in the restroom.

"  Gatwick to Marrakech. Generally a well organised flight and fairly full in Y class. My gripe is about the current food service. This was a fairly long short-haul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service would be welcome and desirable. After a lot of comments from others who have flown BA recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho-ice on board is very limited, especially as much seems to be already 'sold out'. The biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling. It took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though I observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing. Of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front, any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed. Passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which I assume was not welcomed by those passengers. I overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time. It is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long. I remember the days when a British Midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a LHR to Middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an Aer Lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from Dublin to London.

"Madrid to Miami with Iberia has been one of the worst flights I have ever experienced. A330-300 was excellent as was the in-flight entertainment however the service in economy was dreadful. There was no bar service unless you went to the back of the plane and asked for a drink and only once during the 10 hours 30 mins flight did the crew come around with water but you had to stop them to be served. The only time that the crew cleared in was after the meal service therefore the cabin was strewn with cups, cans, wrappers etc. the cabin was like a tip. Not once were the toilets cleaned and they were in a disgusting state. The cabin was very cold and the crew did nothing to improve the temperature within the cabin despite numerous requests. Most people wore their jackets/coats and/or had blankets around them for much of the flight. The all-female cabin crew were surly (apart from one lady) and other than delivering the meal tray and selling tax free goods, did absolutely nothing in the way of service or attending to passengers. We were sat in 27A/C and observed the crew going to their rest area carrying their blankets and pillows with them. I have no issues whatsoever with flight crews having breaks on such long flights but they weren't doing any work anyway so had little need of a break. I can only say that I am disgusted with the abysmal lack of service, abruptness of the crew and the fact that Iberia is part of the same company as British Airways, they are dreadful. The flight deck spoke once to the passengers shortly after take-off to, in a few words tell us to turn off our mobile devices and then just before landing to give the weather. I now have to look forward to the flight back on Iberia which I will be dreading. In future I will plan my trips from Spain to the USA either on American carriers, who from experience are ten times better than Iberia, or travel via the UK or Europe on known quality airlines. I am a frequent flyer having flown with numerous carriers, long and short haul and I can't emphasise enough how bad this Iberia experience has been. So when travelling long-haul economy, unless you want to travel in a flying, refrigerated garbage can with filthy toilets and no cabin service, fly Iberia.

The seat is rather strange as it is a hard shell where the seat slides forward to recline. However I found my seat to be slightly broken so it did not recline as much as it should. My wife's seat next to me was in better condition, so she got full recline which looked comfortable. Generally the cabin looked very tired and in need of a refresh. The in-flight entertainment selection was not bad but limited compared with other airlines. The food was, on the other hand, very good. I would not have been disappointed to get the vegetable pasta in business class. The pre-landing snack, however, was probably the smallest tune sandwich I have ever seen. It was borderline a joke of a snack. The crew was friendly and attentive and they seemed well intended.

In Frankfurt my flight to Boston was displaying on the screens but no gate indicated for a long time. I approached a member of staff to ask and was told ""I am not the Information counter"".

Apparently Spirit cancelled every flight departing from Houston at the last minute. All other airlines were flying without issue. Needless to say my entire vacation was ruined. 5 - 7 business days to refund the flight and baggage fees! The fare is not cheaper once you pay for all the ""extras"".",Detractor

A hot meal & water, juice, coffee is provided on long haul flights but meals must be paid for on shorter flights. No free alcohol. Cabin service is ok. Entertainment system is basic but ok.

"Check-in for my British Airways flight at Gatwics North Terminal with no queue and staff friendly and chatty. Boarding was quick. The A319 had not yet been fitted with the new seats, but they were still comfortable and moderately spacious. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The return journey was also quite good, except the flight was change to a 01:10 departure instead of 23:40 so it meant that nearly most shops (except duty free) at Alicante were closed. Also it meant that the flight arrived back into Gatwick at 02:40 which wasn't very pleasant as we had to then drive another hour and a half home.

HEL-CPH-LHR on a CR9 and then an A321. Both flights arrived early and baggage claim at Heathrow was speedy. Service is limited only tea or coffee is free although a second cup was offered on the CPH-LHR sector. You can buy food but I noticed a number of passengers out of CPH tucking into sandwiches they had purchased at the airport. The A321 has nose wheel cam which displayed on the overhead screens. Great images of the taxi and take off and approach onto 27L at Heathrow. Seats are ok - not leather but fabric like the old days. The crews are mixed. The older staff are fine jolly and do smile the younger ones though are the opposite. They are efficient but seemed unable to smile. This let the airline down. As for recommending they are ok but you might get as good a deal using some LLCs from CPH.,Passive
Ridiculously cheap fare LHR-KWI-KOC returning TRV-KWI-LHR. Connection time in Kuwait was reasonable and all flights on time. Flights full in economy but staff were pleasant enough and food was standard economy fare. The aircraft interiors were clean and seemed fairly modern. I noticed a few seats that did not recline properly and was aware that some people had problems with their in-flight entertainment systems. Maybe I was lucky?

I told the flight attendant what I wanted to eat from the menu where items required a choice, assuming that the rest of the menu would follow but all I got was I had selected from that section none of the other items came. The lounge in Doha is large and somewhat impersonal but excellent nevertheless. DOH-BKK Business Class, the crew apart seemed disinterested. Some passengers had finished their meal before others had started. I guess what niggled me not being on the receiving end of top priority as I usually am. All in all OK service and flight.

 San Francisco to Hyderabad via London. I had a really bad experience with British Airways. I had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try British Airways instead of taking my regular Emirates. The flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take-off. The customer care was unresponsive. I have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times. I had to go book Emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price. I wrote email to customer care. It has taken so much time to get a response from them. The bad part is they won't refund your ticket price. I hope no one goes through such similar issue. My honest opinion: Be sure of your travel plans before you book British Airways. I was my first and last journey. I wont recommend personally to anyone.,Detractor
"  Brisbane to Christchurch return. Return leg via Sydney. Used the recently refurbished Qantas Business Lounge at Brisbane Airport. A real sanctuary compared with its former self. The attendants on the mezzanine level were friendly, offering hot breakfast options, to make coffee, and assist in any way. Qantas have done well in improving service here. Boarding was quick enough and hassle free. Landed in Christchurch on time and bags on the belt within 10 minutes. My bag was premium tagged and was fourth bag on the belt. Christchurch to Brisbane via Sydney on return was a day of flying I'd rather forget. Our flight to Sydney was delayed by over four hours due to fog at Christchurch and the aircraft being diverted to Auckland for fuel and waiting for fog to lift. As I had an onward connection in Sydney, I inquired at the gate desk with a well rehearsed reply from the gate agent, ""when you get to Sydney, it will be all sorted, someone will be waiting for you at the gate."" Of course, this was not the case, but I did learn that Qantas at Christchurch is contracted and apart from getting passengers on planes, they cannot do much more for you. It was interesting to note that Singapore Airlines Boeing 777 suffered the same fate. Over the PA was announced, ""Singapore Airlines apologises for the delay due to fog etc, we have $20 vouchers for food and beverages."" Qantas passengers were not afforded any such appreciation, and who I might add, had been waiting far longer than Singapore Airlines passengers. Once the Qantas aircraft arrived from Auckland, things seemed to move quicker and soon enough boarding and on the plane. Once departed from Christchurch, the service on board was excellent. The food was good and there were a couple of water runs on this three hour flight. This flight, albeit late was one of the better ones I have had with Qantas. Once in Sydney, I had a Qantas agent phone me, while still taxiing to the international terminal advising my original flight had been cancelled and I was rebooked onto a 7pm flight to Brisbane. This was so much later than my original 11.30am arrival into Brisbane. As I had a bag checked, I had to take the flight as it was the only one available. The Qantas agent appeared to want to help but could not give me an earlier flight due to unavailability. So, after rechecking my bag through to Brisbane on this later flight, I proceeded to Sydney Domestic and waited in the Qantas Club for the hours to pass by. Thankfully a PA announcement requesting passengers from later flights to go on a 4.30pm flight was announced. I took this up. The Qantas staff at the Qantas Club were helpful but I feared that by changing my flight, my bag would not change with it. Sure enough, after arriving Brisbane, my bag was still in Sydney. Bag was delivered a day later. It was just a day of mishaps, but I was happy with each of the Qantas staff I dealt with.",Promoter

"  London Heathrow to Cape Town return via Istanbul. All the staff of Turkish airlines were so obliging from the check in at Heathrow to the staff on the planes. They went the extra mile to make you feel comfortable. We ordered kosher food and it was delicious, well flavored and varied combinations. The best I have tasted in a long time and we are frequent travelers. The planes were all very full. This can be a problem on the long haul flights as the seats are not very widely positioned so when the front one tries to incline you are left with very little feet room. The office staff in London helped me beforehand to order what I needed and all my requirements were met.

"  The flights from Tampa to Tel Aviv via Frankfurt were uneventful with the possible exception of having to hike half way around the airport at Frankfurt. The return flight was quite different, it started with Lufthansa canceling our flights on one date and telling us we would have to leave a day earlier or a day later the problem was I would either have to pay for an additional day which was not available - so I opted to leave a day early which meant I was out a days room rent, which is not cheap. We were also bought our tickets 6 months in advance and paid extra for seats in the front of the plane. On the flights they put us on we were in the back of the plane, telling us it didn't matter that we paid for advanced seating, that only meant you were paying for window or aisle - really - we paid $180.00 extra for a window or aisle seat. In conclusion I understand flight changes happen, but I do not understand the rudeness of the employees in Frankfurt when I went to customer service to talk about a refund on our return flight seating, which was definitely not what we paid for.",Detractor

"  Even as seasoned traveler, this has been the worst travel experience of my life. It started with the hidden fees being an unpleasant surprise. After booking through a travel website I discovered the seating/baggage/etc. fees. I contacted customer service since I was unaware and it actually would have been cheaper to fly another airline once you take into account their fees. Once at the airport, my flight was delayed. Okay, weather and stuff happens. The problem I have is that they were notifying by email only and no one was available at the gate to answer questions. I felt they could have taken better care of people despite having an uncontrollable delay. The fees started they were in place to save time during boarding but they actually did quite the opposite due to the number of individuals that had to be stopped and the time it took for them to complain. The way home was a new adventure. We were delayed once and the gate agent announced upon the second delay that they could not find our pilots? At that point, I was done. I booked another flight for the following morning on another airline. But it wasn't over yet - they totally lost my bag. Spirit will never get my business again and the site I booked the tickets through should probably stop doing business with them as well. The whole experience was an absolute trainwreck.",Detractor

This is what it happens when airlines charge for check in bags. You have to purchase the meal on board but the crew with a few smiles serves complimentary non alcoholic drinks. I found it weird when the crew were saying ""We know that you have a choice thank you for choosing us"" during their announcements. I chose American Airlines simply because it offered a lower price despite the long trip I had to do. Overall this airline is not amazing but it's slightly better than some low cost airlines.

I flew with this airline from Brussels to London. The check-in process was fine as was the bag drop too. Queue management was not very good at all and caused a few concerns to say the least.

"  Budapest to Luton. When saving money isn't worth it, we all want a bargain but sometimes it's better to shell out a bit more than save money for an awful service. I booked a getaway on Groupon so if anyone reading this is in the same boat then I urge you to reconsider. Flying to Budapest the flight was delayed an hour and change with nothing resembling an explanation given, luckily the flight wasn't full so I could stretch out some but I could tell it would be uncomfortably cramped if anyone was sitting next to me, and I'm only 5'11 so I shudder to think how anyone over 6ft would fare. Then returning we find out much to out chagrin that we had to check in online, bear in mind no-one saw fit to inform us of this, not Groupon, the airline or the company we booked it through. And to make it worse me and my girlfriend were seated at opposite ends of the plane. The ground staff were of no help, not even attempting to help us find a solution let alone sympathise with our problems. So in summary, this airline may be cheap but if you have even a modicome of care for the pleasantness of your journey then I cannot recommend enough paying slightly more and flying with a reputable airline and I'm including easy jet and Ryanair so that should tell you something.",Detractor
"  Gatwick to Kolkata via Dubai, with a stopover of around 1 hr 30 mins in Dubai. Mobile boarding pass for both legs issued at the time of on line check in. Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only â€“ the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations. I understand the airlines has not anything legally wrong, but otherwise did not find any redeeming feature in Airlines handling of the issue, let alone appreciation of the inconvenience caused.",Detractor

" Seattle to Denver. Frontier flights are cheap but you get what you pay for. There are no complimentary snacks on the plane, and they charge for everything like bags and even your seat selection. The worst thing though, is that the counters to check your bags dont even open until 2 hours before the flight. We always try to get to the airport early because traffic is unpredictable, and it gives us extra time to make sure the kids are good to go. However, we end up stranded at the ticket counters with two bored kids and giant bags and car seats that would not be possible to drag around while shopping or eating. Also, the Seattle airport didn't have much to do before going all the way the through security. It consistently makes the airport experience terrible. Then there is another consistent issue where they often board planes an hour late without updating their information boards and it has been confusing several times...and again...standing in line with no clue how long it's going to be for an hour with bored kids is hell. In general, their flights are often canceled or delayed.",Detractor

"Ethiopian Airlines price was fantastic for us as pensioners, Â£320 return from Dublin to Johannesburg, so we were willing to put up with a little discomfort, but were impressed with most things. Addis Ababa is not the world's idea of a great airport and the ground staff there were most unhelpful and far from organised. It was only a 2hr 25m stopover, as we waited for our connecting flight to Dublin. The announcement, over an antiquated address system, was called as a Canadian flight and via Dublin was never mentioned, caught it by the skin of our teeth. Ground staff at Johannesburg were great and could not have been more helpful. We had 3 seats each from Johannesburg to Addis to relax on for the 4.5hr flight, food acceptable and no worse than other airlines. The planes look well used and a lot of the seat screens did not work. Cabin crew vary from inexperienced to most helpful and just the luck of the draw.

For the simple reason that they do not permanently have maintenance facilities and, even, a simple technician at the place of the technical issue. Therefore, if anything happens there and they cannot find by any technician hanging around by chance, then they need to send somebody from Brussels, which means by default a 24 hours delay at the place of the technical issue. Can you believe this? No? It is nevertheless true. They admitted it openly during the 30th of June, 2018 flight from Abidjan to Brussels, with a technical issue in Ouagadougou.

Outbound the seats were very tiny with absolutely no legroom at all, thankfully we were only in the air 50 minutes. Coming back, it was an hour late, again no explanation, just seemed par for the course with this lot. I personally would avoid travelling with them again if I could.",Detractor
BRU-ORD-BRU. On the flight BRU-ORD the entertainment system was down so we had no entertainment at all. This was announced prior to boarding so it did not come as a bad surprise after take-off. This is not pleasant on a 9+ hours flight but United compensated us by serving all beverages for free including beers wines and liquor. After dinner the attendant even proposed to pour us a cognac without we had to asked for us. This is proper compensation and client care. The food was airplane food not great but the chicken was OK and before landing in Chicago we got a hot sandwich. On the flight ORD-BRU the entertainment system was working properly but the seatback screens on the Boeing 767 were utterly small. For dinner I ordered the pasta which was dough and something like tomato sauce not very tasty. Legroom was better than on most Asian airlines and attendants were courteous and caring. I see no reason why I should not take United again.,Passive

Not only were my flights delayed, but my luggage was lost for several days, with Air China taking absolutely no responsibility, except for the first day on which they told me that the place was unbalanced so they took my suitcase off.

AUS to JFK JFK to NCE flight DL 1972 and DL 0082. Return NCE to AMS to ATL to AUS. DL 9497 and DL0239 with ATL to AUS DL 0686. I prefer Delta when flying American carriers and they're my no. 2 choice for all airlines Air France being my no. 1. In a trip this month to France flying into Nice I would have few complaints. An issue I've not encountered before rather two issues are the problem of the midplane lavatories next to the exit row seats and Deltas food service. I'll leave it to the reader to figure the issues with the lavatories and in fairness it should be an issue for all airlines flying the 767. Food however is a real issue. I have never had worse airline food than these two trips. When a convenience store Hot Pocket rates over Delta's offerings there is a real problem.,Promoter
This is the worst airline to fly on. No leg room for standard seating. You have to pay for everything separately and once your finish the cost is much higher. If I could change my ticket to another airline I would. But I will be leaving Florida on Monday 18th August. The 9 dollar club is a joke. Customer service is the awful. This is one customer Spirit has lost. Be aware. You're paying for bad service.,Detractor
BOG-SCL-BOG. Avianca's new business class is bad. I used to be a fan of Avianca. It's usually a reliable airline but it's new business class is a mess. On short haul (if you can call a 6 hour flight from Bogota to NYC or Santiago short haul) seat comfort is terrible: almost zero recline and ridiculous pitch between rows. On long haul (A330) they just installed new angled seats which are terrible to sleep on. So if you go to Europe chose Iberia instead (fully flat) and within region LAN remains unbeatable in comfort and service. In Avianca the food service is also mediocre and the wine choice (Trio and Trivento - both very average) is the same for 24 months now. The only good elements are IFE on demand and the flight attendants who are friendly. Boarding in Bogota is a mess (no priority lanes) and lounge is also mediocre without enough seats on peak periods.,Detractor
"  London Heathrow to Xi'an return via Beijing. I would never use Air China again. They rescheduled two flights, one before we went and another before we returned. Then the return connecting flight from Xian to Beijing was almost two hours late which caused us to miss our flight back from Beijing to Heathrow. They had to get us new flights back to London, mine was via Paris and my wife and stepdaughter had to go on a separate flight via Madrid. The reason for this they told us was they couldn't get us 3 seats together on the same flight. Later my wife told me she saw at least one guy sleeping across 3 seats on her flight, so this was utter rubbish. Total time to travel door to door coming home was almost 40 hrs - ridiculous for a journey that should normally take 24hrs. I've travelled to China many many times over the past 10 years and have never missed a flight with any other airline. As if this wasn't bad enough the food is absolutely disgusting as well and the inflight movies were dated and a waste of time. No apologies received from any staff at Air China - total disgrace. The flights were cheap and you get what you pay for - never again!",Detractor
"Berlin to Dublin via Copenhagen. This has to be the worst legacy short haul airline in Europe. On the shortest leg, Berlin to Copenhagen, we were served 1 mint chocolate. No drink service nothing at all. The male staff member spoke to a passenger near us, regarding where to put a bag, with total contempt. I have never heard such a rude purser. On the 2 hour flight to Dublin, we were served 1 drink of coffee and that was it. The seating is cattle class, very tight and uncomfortable. They allowed a clearly drunk passenger to shout and swear at his friends across the isle, which offended most of the plane. This tirade went on until we landed. The stewardesses just smiled at them and thought it was all very funny. During the booking process, cancellation insurance was added, which was not wanted, nor ordered. I immediately emailed the airline, but heard nothing from them for 3 days. When I did hear from them, the email told me to call Customer Services. CS had me on hold for 40 minutes and then refused to do anything, as I should have notified them straight away that I did not require the insurance. I explained that I had informed the airline immediately, via the email SAS provided for such complaints. They then gave me a phone number of the insurer. I called it, this was incorrect. The number SAS gave me was for an old insurance company, who had not provided their insurance for over 8 months. I tried to contact the insurer via the details on the policy, every email bounced back and was ""Undeliverable"". In the end I gave up trying to cancel it. Terrible. Overall this is the worst airline I have flown in many many years. I will avoid them in the future.",Detractor

First time flying in 13 years. Flew from ORD to LAS and then from LAS to SAN. I was randomly assigned a seat in the aisle which worked out great for me being over 6 feet tall as the legroom was kind of small. Shifting my position helped alleviate any weariness. For as cheap of a price as I got I kind of figured there would be some things cut to help cost-efficiency. My departing flights left on time and my returning flight was actually early by about 15-20 minutes. Did not purchase food or drink on board as I brought my own. No issues with boarding or luggage as I was staying for a week in California and was able to fit everything into my carry-on. Staff were very friendly. I can appreciate the no-frills type of service offered since my main concern with going on vacation is the destination not the extra stuff I don't need on the journey.,Promoter

"  I booked a trip from Brussels to Barcelona for the weekend with Vueling Airlines. My flight to Barcelona was scheduled to leave Brussels Airport at 9.25 pm and reach Barcelona at 11.30. The flight was delayed twice without any explanation at all. The flight before us that was scheduled to leave around 6.30 still had not left by the time we were suppose to begin boarding. They sat on the plane for over an hour during this time. After repeatedly asking for information (along with many other travelers) we were told that we would be flying out after 2 am. We did not get into Barcelona until nearly 5 am at which point the only available transportation method was a 30 euro cab drive into the city. On the return flight, my original 3.30 pm departure was canceled and rescheduled for 6.40. Again, the flight was repeatedly delayed without any explanation, apology or information. After our third delay, the large crowd of travelers became very agitated and started asking questions of an Iberia worker that had informed us our flight would not leave until 11.20 pm. After pressure from the crowd, he made a phone call and we were finally allowed to board a plane at 10.40. This flight did not leave Barcelona until midnight, meaning we sat on the runway for over an hour. I missed my train home upon arrival in Barcelona and was again forced to take a taxi. I understand that this is a budget airline, but it was the absolute worse traveling experience I have had.",Detractor
"  Frankfurt to Dubai via Doha. Qatar Airways really is in a class of its own when flying Business Class. Aircraft brand-new, seating outstanding (777 in 2-2-2 layout - only weak point is no Wifi), staff naturally friendly, meal service on demand whenever you want it and tasty food. As this might not be enough, you get, as they call the premium class between DOH and DWC ""First Class"", access to the incredible Al Safwa First Lounge in Doha, where you find absolute silence and all the rest you dream of being used to overcrowded european Business Lounges. In Frankfurt, Qatar uses the Air Canada Star Gold Lounge, which is not at all bad, but nothing compared to Doha. Flying to Dubai via DWC was a great decision. This airport is really small, so the distance to walk from the aircraft to the car-parking (free and empty) is about 200m and takes, queue-less immigration and baggage claim inclusive, some 20 minutes. The short 40 min flight DOH-DWC was operated by Al Maha Airways. You get real Business Class recliner seats, pre-departure drink, arabic coffee and a warm tasty meal. For me, Qatar Airways is the better way to fly - for not even 2100â‚¬ return. Bye, bye, european carriers.",Promoter
"  I believe that a 5 star airline should show consistency in the service provided. After a great flight to Europe with Cathay Pacific I had a pretty bad experience with a regional flight. They announced a 4 hour delay at BKK airport. For this I received a vouched of 70HKD (yes 70) for a ""dinner"" in one of the outlets. My hunt for an outlet that was happy to accept it has been pretty long. After a long but nice wait at their new lounge I boarded and surprise - the aircraft is fitted with the hard shell seats. The worst recline ever experienced. I believe that European low cost airlines have bigger recline than this ""premium"" airline. As often happens with CX the food was not good for western's taste. And as often happens they underestimated (or under communicate) the actual scale of the delay, being almost one hour longer than officially stated. From a premium airline I expect more.",Detractor

When I asked flight crew what's new about it, she indicated with her hands that the seats were more cramped now. It is a shame that British Airways has fallen prey to greed and instead of upgrading its business product, it has introduced a very poor product on Club Europe. Food was poor and so was the inflight service. If the person in front reclines, it is impossible to even hold a newspaper and read it. I will never fly British Airways Club Europe again.",Detractor
Just flown GF2 LHR-BAH (Airbus 330) Seats 23A/C connecting to GF556 BAH-MCT (Airbus 320) Seats 11E/F. Both economy. After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little concerned however I must say I was very pleased with Gulf Air. We departed late from Heathrow not because of Gulf Air but the usual Heathrow being busy scenario and this meant we would be arrived in Bahrain with a very short connection time of about one hour. The A330 'KC' had been refitted with the new interior which made the cabin smart bright and airy. Seat was comfortable for the six and a half hour journey and I was only just starting to get restless as we arrived. I'm over 6' tall by the way! Cabin crew were very friendly but don't expect much in the way of offerings onboard. We got a drink just after leaving Heathrow then the next offering was two hours later and that was lunch. The food was rather good and I cleared everything! After Lunch the next your get will be just before arrival and that's just orange juice or water. I was starving by the time we arrived in Bahrain but because of the short connection time and arriving late didn't have time to buy anything so next time I would board with supplies. Note that in arrival in Bahrain it will be a bus from the aircraft to the terminal as they park the aircraft up overnight away from the terminal and you'll have to get through another security check too so don't hang about! Bags had been checked through from London so we had everything crossed that they would make it to Muscat too. Flight from BAH-MCT was hassle free the seats actually had more leg room than the flight from London weird! It's only about an hour and a half so comfort not an issue. The aircraft look nearly new so are clean and bright inside and out. You get a cold snack too which was tasty. Crew friendly and both legs and believe it or not our bags arrived too. Well done Gulf Air and fingers crossed it's as good on the way back later this week.,Promoter

" Berlin to Athens. I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I feel it necessary to warn people about Ryanair. I tried to check in online before my flight, but neither their app or their website were working. I figured, â€œNo worries. I'll just check in at the airport. I don't even have any bags to checkâ€. But when I got to the ticket counter I was informed that because I did not check in online I would be charged a 55 Euro â€œcheck in feeâ€. I was at the ticket counter an hour and a half before my flight, but they told me you could only check in in person 2 hours before a flight to avoid the 55 Euro fee? I've never heard of any other airline doing something like this. I asked if I had any other options since I had tried to check in via their app and website which had not been working. I was rudely told â€œPay the fee now, or get out of line and don't fly with us.â€ To top it all off, the exchange rate to US dollars made my fee increase to $61.52. They also charged the two people I was traveling with, so in total we paid $184.56 for a â€œcheck in feeâ€. Ryanair must make a fortune doing this to people. Don't let them do this to you!

"  Cape Town to Athens via Istanbul. My wife and I were traveling with twins in business class, and her family was also on the plane but traveling in economy class. As we got to the boarding gate, we wanted to get the rest of our family onto business class. There were seats available, but the first person we asked said it was impossible to change seats at such a late time. I then met a staff member and he called someone in Istanbul to see if it was possible. After a few phone calls, he asked for my credit card details and was able to upgrade the rest of my family to business class. The reason this is so impressive is that he had to go against the inbuilt systems to delight a customer. I think the airline industry needs more staff like him and less people who just follow the process. I will be flying Turkish airlines again because of this.",Promoter

She is 82 years of age and had a broken vertebra 6 months back and after my trip to SYD/MEL last Oct-Nov I decided that the transit is pretty good at Delhi and my mother could go unaccompanied in Business Class. The flight arrived 45 mins ahead of schedule at JFK and being a passenger in a wheelchair she was absolutely thrilled with the care the AI staff bestowed on her. The only issue I faced was getting a wheelchair at Chennai airport as the AI counter was closed and I was not allowed inside - but security staff were kind enough to offer a seat for my mother and advised me to get an AI staff and fetch a wheelchair. My mother informs me that the connection in Delhi (to AI 101) was very smooth and she was well taken care of. She was full of praise for the cabin staff. AI has definitely turned over a new leaf and there has been a tremendous improvement in their attitude as well as service - their hub at T3 Delhi is much better than what prevailed in Mumbai and the ground staff are wonderful at Delhi!,Promoter

The planes are so packed (this is industry wide, not just United) there's no flexibility in the system for weather delays. This also makes them uncomfortable. When I got annoyed enough that I tried three times to upgrade to Premium Economy hoping to score an empty center seat, United's App steadfastly refused to take my money, so I stayed wedged back in the back of the plane. Would I recommend United? Yes. They're no worse than any other carrier. The benefit of United though, is you can get their service at more locations than just about any other airline. Using the smaller, regional airports like Harrisburg saves a lot of airport headaches - that's what gives United the leg up over other carriers for me.",Passive

Other family took the same itinerary home from Paris on a trip a month later (August 2015). Could lightening strike twice? We checked three pieces of carry on luggage and all of it was lost in Montreal. We arrived home last night. One bag has been found and the other two have not.

"  What has happened to our beautiful Airline? We always flew Air Canada for the service and the people but now I fly further to avoid Air Canada. On Dec 31 2016, AC873, FRA-YYZ, either the FA who worked the rear business class section was getting ready for retirement or she was having a really bad day because her unfriendly, take it or leave it, monosyllabic attitude was quite pronounced. The new business class seat on the 777-300 is actually not so bad. The screen's a bit close but it's big and the seat depth is a bit short (I could never get the foot rest up to a comfortable height) but there's lots of space and charging stations and places for things. Very mediocre wine selection, I think one choice of either old or new world in red or white and as I said very mediocre. I hear they have espresso's and cappuccino's but they were not offered. I ordered the vegetarian meal which came out vegan and really it's mind boggling what the kitchen at AC thinks vegetarians eat. Years ago I had an amazing veg meal on a flight from Toronto to Calgary, roasted veg with baked tofu, really well done but this was some tasteless roasted eggplant on Polenta with a tablespoon of tomato sauce and that's pretty much what AC serve these days. All of this would have been overlooked if the FA had shown any kind of welcome or pleasant attitude. It was bare minimum, no more and definitely no service with a smile. AC 610, YYZ-YHZ started out well and I slept through most of it until the last 15 minutes of landing approach, when a little boy two rows behind us in business class, started to piercingly scream for his mother and was unconsolable screaming ""Momee"" until we landed. I thought maybe mommy was meeting the plane but it turned out that ""Momee!"" was the FA in-charge. To her credit, she remained the FA in-charge and didn't get up but probably not a good idea to fly with the family. I was a loyal AC flyer for decades but now Lufthansa and United I like better and I fly them 90% of the time. The timing on this route was deciding factor in flying with AC this time but that will not happen again. LH FA's are always welcoming and friendly and cannot do enough to make you comfortable up front. Other airlines amenity kits are becoming collectables but not so the hideous herringbone, sparse offering on AC. LH, Eva and Thai's Rimova amenity kits are a reason to fly them and not available anywhere else. I think AC have forgotten that many of us love to fly and it's about a happy experience.

There was an Italian family who boarded late, and once there, attempted to move into seats in business and premium economy. The drama that ensued was long and loud and it involved every member of the crew all trying to instruct them to take their assigned seats.

The plane was on the older side, but was in fairly decent shape. The center bathroom in the middle of the plane is the largest bathroom I've ever been in on an airplane. Easily twice the size of a normal plane bathroom. We were in 25A/C and the seats are normal economy seats. It didn't feel more cramped than other economy cabins I've flown in. There is no entertainment available, so make sure you download the Air Canada app on your tablet or phone before you board. There are quite a few movie choices on the app, but most of them are old. We experienced no problems with the connectivity on this flight. On this flight we were offered a hot meal (pasta or chicken), a snack (bag of cookies) and then a hot snack (chicken or veggie wrap). Alcohol is available for purchase and the crew were constantly wandering through the cabin offering water. The food was decent and typical of other economy class meals I've had. I read a lot negative comments about the crew. Our experience was different. We thought the crew was very good. All of them were pleasant and helpful. Only one of them on our flight rarely smiled, but overall they were good. All of them are multilingual, speaking two, three or four languages. Whether or not our experience with Rouge was an anomaly, the key here is to know what to expect and adjust your expectations accordingly. And don't forget to download that app, or your flight will feel twice as long.",Passive
19/4/15 Flight 304. 1/5/15 Flight 303. 30/4/15 Flight 3050. Travelled from London to Vietnam via Guangzhou and back. Very impressed with the quality of service. The staff both at check in and onboard were very helpful and went out of their way to assist us. As my husband is very tall they gave us seats with extra leg room and even changed our seats during a stop over to ensure that the long journey was comfortable for my husband. Also the staff onboard were very accommodating when it was discovered that our tour company had not ordered me a vegetarian meal as requested. The air hostess very kindly let me have vegetarian crew meals and were most accommodating giving me a choice of meal each time. This went over and above the call of duty. We stayed in a China Southern hotel during our 18 hour stopover and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel. However we found it quite confusing to find where we got transport to the hotel and staff at this desk were not the most helpful. Their level of English was not great. Apart from that I found China Southern Airways to be highly efficient and would definitely travel with them again.,Promoter
 Seattle to Grand Rapids via Denver. Absolutely abysmal. First and last time I've will be flying with them. I needed to get to a wedding in Grand Rapids and they cancelled the flight last minute. The options they gave me would only cost me more money and their representatives were unbelievably unhelpful. They have ruined a very important day for me and cost me a huge amount of money. They should be ashamed of themselves.,Detractor
"Toronto - Milan Malpensa (MXP). At Toronto airport the monitors were showing ""on time"" but when I arrived to the gate boarding was almost completed. On board: dirty. Aircraft: old 767-300. No smile or help from the attendants (all over-head compartments were occupied by their equipment). Pillow and blanket: basic quality. Food: hot chicken low quality salad and cake. Cold bread given by hand by the crew. Breakfast: banana bread. 20 minutes later they came around with drinks and coffee. No magazine on board. Crew shouting loudly for duty free during night flight while people were sleeping. Wouldn't recommend.",Detractor
"  Tel Aviv to Los Angeles via Moscow. By far the worst most incompetent service I have worked with. They will only let you increase your baggage allowance if you request it 36 hours before your flight but it is only a request. This means if they say ""no"", you will not be able to fly with your baggage. There is no security for the customer. I would have been more than happy to add the additional luggage when buying the ticket but I didn't have this option.

I have flown with Cathay many times before but always in Economy or Premium Economy. This was the first time that I have travelled Business Class with them. The flight was Hong Kong to Melbourne return and was on a newly fitted out A330 with the new style Business Class configuration (not the old style herring bone). Overall I was extremely impressed. The service food drink selection and entertainment were all excellent. However the best part of the flight was the seat which was probably the most comfortable business class seat that I have experienced plus there was ample storage space and compartments. The only thing to be aware of is that some seats are not exactly aligned with the window and so you have to crane your neck around the cubicle wall to see out of the window.,Promoter
" Guangzhou to Brisbane, a really enjoyable flight. The leg room was plenty for someone 180cm tall. The cabin staff service was excellent, though their English was average. The inflight food was one of the best I have tasted. The inflight entertainment consisted of a wide variety of TV series, movies, games, music and more. It was possible for customers to apply for inflight Wifi, though it could only be used on devices other than mobile phone, which has to be turned off for the entirety of the flight. Since I only have a mobile phone, I did not apply for this service.",Promoter
" Minneapolis to Orlando. I'm so impressed with Delta. I flew to FL 18 years ago on a different airline and vowed to never fly again. All in all I never enjoyed flying it was just a means to a destination. I made a snap decision to travel with family to see family, tickets bought no backing out. It was a beautiful flight so much so i spent a lot of time looking out the window watching the flight navigator on the seat back so i knew exactly what city were were flying over. We were all seated together on a fully packed flight as well which was a bonus! Although we were in Economy we were treated with the same respect as first class! The Pilot was great, flight attendants were great, snacks were just right. The plane itself was stunning to see inside and out. Spacious, clean, plenty of leg room with free in flight movies, games and much more on every seat back. Headphones were not included but only $2 to purchase. Usually after flying i made myself forget the flight! Now i'm actually looking forward to flying with Delta again! Thank you Delta for a wonderful (non-terrifying) much needed family vacation!

She was coughing while working through our passports, she kept coughing and I asked if she's ok? She said she had just been outside (-15c).

"  I made the mistake of ignoring reviews like this and paid the price the hard way, just save the stress and pay the extra Â£50 to fly with someone else, probably BA. Both my outbound and return flights London Luton to Amsterdam were delayed 2+ hours. On the outbound trip we were forced to stand for nearly 1.5 hours in a queue and then in a stairwell, London Luton is also a horrific experience that should be avoided at all costs. Arrived 2 hours late in Amsterdam. My return trip was, if possible, even worse: the plane we were supposed to be on had a tyre problem. After numerous mixed messages (flight cancelled, flight going, flight cancelled, flight going) a different route's plane was sourced (they delayed that flight by 3 hours instantly) and we landed 3 hours late. Take note: Vueling do not make announcements, so if something goes wrong (delay, gate change etc.) they will not let you know. They won't call passengers, they won't give you updates. This caused a lot of panic and frustration which compounded what was already a stressful experience. To make it even more horrific, we all arrived after the last train to London from Luton Parkway. Cue mass panic and shared Ubers into the city at seriously high cost. Avoid.",Detractor
Although a frequent flyer I have never flown with easyjet so when I booked my first flight with them from Stansted to Edinburgh I didnt know what to expect. I can say that they were fantastic. My partner and I had flown to Edinburgh on business. We booked a return flight for 8pm but we were finished earlier than expected at 1pm. Dreading the long wait for our flight my partner suggested we go to the airport and ask if we could change our flight. I was quite adament that this could not be done unless you paid either over the odds or paid for another seat. We went to the airport and asked the member of staff at the easy jet desk if we could change our flight. She replied of course and had us on the eariler flight leaving at 5.40pm. This was done in the space of 5 minutes and no extra cost at all. We were delayed going out and coming back but not for long and these are things that cannot be helped. I can say they were very professional and accommodating. I will be using them again.,Promoter

LIS-LHR on 30 July J class on an Airbus 320. I was expecting more however I was disappointed. Seat was OK but not particularly comfortable food just average with a choice of a fruit or meat platter either very poor. Cabin crew in an automatic mode no smiling whatsoever more interested in chatting in front of the cabin and complaining about not sure what. No inflight entertainment altogether not even a shared movie. However we departed on time and arrived 15 min before schedule and the price was the cheapest ever for a Business Class seat. Will fly BA again but I am more keen to Intercontinental flights where the quality is superior than European routes.,Passive
" Melbourne to Auckland. Revamped cabin like cabin on Boeing 787 is really great. The new features like excellent IFE, foot net really enhanced the flight. My seat 56F had extra seat room/aisle space because my row was 2-3-2 rather than 2-4-2, and I could put luggage under seat in front of missing seat. The seat pitch has improved too. Food was very disappointing as portions were too small. But flight supervisor kindly offered me extra round of lunch. All flight attendants were quite courteous.",Promoter
"  On 20th December 2016 my wife and I were booked to fly Johannesburg to Hong Kong on South African Airways (SAA). Thereafter and on separate tickets we were booked to fly first class on Cathay Pacific CX711 to Singapore departing 16h10. We checked in on line prior to departing Johannesburg and received our boarding passes and booked our luggage through to Singapore. In-flight delays resulted in the SAA flight landing at 15h14. A lady with a sign with our flight number and names was at the gate. She expedited us through security to the gate. We waited 20 minutes before the flight was called and then presented our passports at the first class queue - our passports were duly checked, the boarding pass was initialled and we were advised to wait for boarding. When attempting to board at 15h55 we were advised that there was a problem and that we should take a seat. After 20 minutes we were advised by a Cathay gate clerk that we had been removed from the flight because our SAA flight had been delayed and that we had been placed on another flight. We questioned what flight and were told to wait. The plane left the gate at 16h21. At 16h40 I requested to speak to the station manager. I was then told that an SAA representative would come and advise us of the situation. This did not happen and I found a Cathay Pacific gate handler who said that we had been removed from the flight in accordance with Cathay Pacific's policy of a connecting flight â€œhaving to have arrived within 60 minutes of the next flights departureâ€. We then questioned what other flight arrangement had been made. His response was that it was an SAA problem and that it had to be sorted out with SAA. No further help was forthcoming and no-one from Cathay Pacific would help us. We then asked as to where we could recover our cases and we were told to â€œget them off the SAA carouselâ€. We scoured the airport for our bags and after an hour found them on a carousel with Cathay Pacific â€œOffloadedâ€. We then set out to find another route to Singapore â€“ this was impossible as it was the height of the festive season rush. After visiting several airline counters we eventually found 2 business class tickets available with Singapore Airlines (at a cost of USD 3200). Once home we attempted to resolve our issues with Cathay Pacific but merely received a string of emails deflecting responsibility to SAA. It is important to note that we complied with Cathay Pacific's conditions of carriage which were that we had to have checked in one hour before the flight and that we had to be at the gate 40 minutes prior to departure â€“ when we arrived at the gate we were in possession of boarding passes with our seat allocations. SAA could not be held liable under these circumstances. We have spent the last 8 weeks trying to obtain a refund of our first class airfare and have also tried to obtain compensation for our replacement tickets. No joy â€“ just a run around from Cathay Pacific. Cathay Pacific maintain that they â€œreserved the right to assign or reassign seats at any time, even after boardingâ€. They maintain that this gave them the right to cancel our seats and sell them to someone else. If this is the way that Cathay Pacific treat first class passengers, I would hate to see how they treat everyone else.",Detractor
"Flew from Tucson to Denver. After many miles with United, I have concluded that: 1) The company and most of the employees just don't care about service. 2) They will cancel flights at the last minute when the planes are not full. 3) They have a lot of ""mechanical problems"", and the lie about the expected departure time to prevent you from making other arrangements. 4) Their attitude is ""take it or leave it"".

"  Washington to Las Vegas via Denver. I describe Frontier Airlines as ""they get you there"". I say this because the planes are uncomfortable and the flight plans are pretty rough, especially if you are buying tickets during a promotion. The promotional times generally cover weekdays, less Friday. And the flight plans during those days generally involve stopping in Denver, which could be 1 hour or up to 3 hours. Denver airport is very big, and comfortable, but it is a pain to stopover for west-bound travel. I do recommend the cheap $20 travel insurance. There seems to be a high incidence of delays with flights. My flight from Las Vegas was delayed by a half hour because of crew issues. My flight from San Francisco the week prior was cancelled because of the pilot thinking there was a huge maintenance issue. The cancellation resulted in my wife and I getting $200 vouchers, which I guess was a result of having the travel insurance. $400 free, great. But now we have to fly with Frontier again, and I have to use the vouchers within 3 months of issuance (ugh). Frontier is a budget airline, and I get what that involves - fees for everything. I just wish that they would be a bit more focused on their budget status. Budget airline implies they want to fly as many minutes possible and be on the ground as few minutes as possible. Meaning, the quicker it takes to load the plane the more money they make since they can fly more. I would like to know if European airlines do this, but Frontier should be different from all the standard airlines and load the plane from the back first instead of by zone, mostly front first. Yes, I understand that this may result in the people who pay for seat upgrades (which are in the first 5 rows of the plane) to possibly lose the ability to stow their carry-on because of limited bin space, but perhaps they should force people who take the cheap option (like me) to check their baggage. Already there is a $5 incentive to check baggage when you buy tickets. It is usually $30 to carry-on a bag and $25 to check it. I chose to save those $5 and checked one big bag for my wife and I. They should make the incentive bigger for the cheap-minded passengers, like $15 or something because there are still too many people carrying bags on, and carry-ons slow down the boarding process. Perhaps they should setup a system wherein they limit the number of carry-on purchases based on bin space, with priority given to those who pay for seat upgrades. Like other budget airlines, everything comes at a cost - $10 for not printing a boarding pass at home (rarely enforced), cost for food on-board, cost for upgraded seats, cost for selecting a seat at check-in (if you must select a seat for free, you need to do it early and you are limited to the center seat in the last 10 rows or so). Just select no seat and let the system do it for you. The worst part of frontier is the seat. The width and the leg room are pretty standard, and the seat base cushion is fine, but the seat back is horrible. It is a layer of plastic covered by a thin layer of padding and then a thin layer of leather. And the backs don't recline. It is super uncomfortable to try sleeping. The trays are small, so good luck putting your head down. The next time I fly Frontier (which will be the last time I fly, thanks to the vouchers) I will pay for the seat upgrade to the front 5 rows which are more like Delta's seats, comfortable and they recline.",Detractor
"âŒ   I was very dissatisfied with American Airlines during my last trip. My flight from Colorado Springs to Shreveport was weather delayed in Colorado Springs. I understand that these things happen. But when arriving in Dallas to switch connections to go to Shreveport, I rushed to my gate and found that my plane was still at the gate. But they would not allow me to board. The flight departed earlier than scheduled with me watching it leave the gate without me. I was very disappointed that American did not notify the gate that a passenger was a few minutes late due to their late arrival of a connecting flight. It is not like it was an hour or more, it was 10 minutes at most. Other airlines that I have flown have notified other gates of this happening, especially if it is weather related. I am a frequent flier on many airlines, and it has been done for me before. Due to this, I was under a lot of stress. My main reason for going to Shreveport was to meet my daughter and get her back home to Florida. I went to flight services in Dallas, and they were not any help at all. No monetary help or voucher for a hotel overnight either. They attempted to help me with getting my checked bag that arrived with me in Dallas, but the employee from my arriving gate had already gone home because it was after 9. Because of this, my bag left the next morning to go to Shreveport, even though I was going to be leaving from Dallas later in the day to go back to Florida with my daughter, who was arriving from Shreveport. To make things worse, I had to wait 6 days to get my suitcase returned to me in Florida. After checking with American baggage services, I found out that it stayed in Shreveport for 5 days sitting there. My bag had important business materials inside. Needless to say, unless it is a last resort, I will not be flying American Airlines again. They would not even offer me restitution or a baggage refund for my inconvenience unless I showed receipts of $150.00 or more.",Detractor

"They suck you in with cheap ticket prices but then ravage you with extra charges and fees. The extras fees for us totalled $150! $40 per early checked bag (If we had checked in at the airport it would have been $100 per bag and $10 per person. Oh and a carry-on would have been another $100.) Plus their weight limit is 40lbs so if your bag is over that it'll be an additional $25. Also if you don't pay the $100 for a carry on to go in the overhead bin they won't let you stow it up there because it's reserved for those who did pay. Then we had to pay for our seats which would be free if we were ok with random chance seating. Also because we had to take a connecting flight we had to pay for seats on both planes. Then icing on the cake the regular $20 in taxes and fees. It should be considered fraud! In my opinion if you want a no frills airline to save some money check out Allegiant. They do it right. The way Spirit does it by the time you're done with all their extra fees they're no cheaper than anyone else. Allegiant still keeps it cheap despite the extra fees they charge. We paid the $18 for the ""Big"" seats but when we boarded the plane the ones we had chosen/paid for didn't even exist. They were just regular seats!

Expedia tried to get me on another flight that night, Expedia not the airline of which I was a customer! Expedia informed me that Jetblue had no other fights that night, and I would have to fly out in the afternoon the next day. I could not do that, I had no money to spend on another hotel stay for the night, I was already checked out of my previous hotel, and ready to go home. I thought in the least, Jetblue would accommodate me with a free hotel stay for the night, but they were not accommodating in any way whatsoever. They did not reassure me that they would at least try to get me back on another flight that night, no hotel stay, nothing! Luckily, some friends I was with managed to get us a flight that night on Virgin America. But Jetblue had no compassion, were completely uncaring towards me, and my two other friends who were on that same canceled flight.

April 27th overnight flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Washington Reagan (DCA) with stopover in Detroit (DTW). Economy seats on flight from SFO to DTW were extremely uncomfortable: hardly any legroom - very little padding no padding on armrests and minimal recline.

The economy seats from DTW to DCA had slightly more recline and were therefore tolerable.

"The seats were uncomfortable, barely reclined and featured an ""innovative"" design to provide 3"" of leg room. I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told ""we'll see"" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline.

"Sacramento to Flagstaff. Once again a completely disastrous experience with this airline. Years ago flying from Orlando to Sacramento they left us stranded in Phoenix and offered no assistance whatsoever. We literally watched them put our luggage on the plane as they slammed the door in our face and said sorry it's to late and left us stranded in Phoenix with 2 young kids without our luggage. Thank god for Southwest, we were able to buy tickets to get home the same day. All they offered after we contacted their customer service was a voucher for future flights, no refund for the flight they failed to let us board. So this experience was just as horrific! Except worse! Our departure from Sacramento was scheduled for early morning so we decided to stay at a hotel to be closer and allow us extra time. When we arrived they informed us the plane had hit a bird while landing which I completely understand is out of their control. The way they handled things were where the disaster began. There was clearly no sense of urgency from the ground crew to inspect or repair anything, no repairs were needed. None the less delayed for 2 hours made our connection to Flagstaff impossible. When we asked to get on the next flight we were informed by another non-caring American Airlines employee that the rest of the flights for the day were full so they could only get us there the next morning. For a 30 minute flight we opted to rent a car and drive so we wouldn't loose any more of our already shortened weekend time with our daughter. When we asked for our luggage they rudely informed us that we would have to wait until it showed up in Flagstaff later that night - and you'll never guess but that flight was delayed too! When we arrived at the Flagstaff airport Sunday after our shortened weekend visit with our daughter, they checked us through security, took our bags and then informed everyone they had an issue with one of the plane doors and we would be delayed. After about an hour they informed everyone that they were sending a bus to pick us up and drive us to Phoenix since they were unable to resolve the door issue. Once again missing our connection flight back home. We again opted to rent a car and head on our own way so we would be assured of getting to Phoenix as quickly as possible. What a total nightmare thanks to American Airlines once again! It might not have been so bad if they had just one person that actually acted like they cared and maybe attempted to be simpathetic.

"  Booked a couple of days to Belfast and back to Luton with easyJet. My hand luggage was taken both times to store as a check in bag. And when I mentioned to the crew that I chose hand luggage due to time saving reasons and had to check in my bag on the way to Belfast already her reply was: ""in that case you know that you need to come first and queue up and bag will not be taken"". It was said in a very rude way and I don't think it's right at all for easyJet to force people to do so when you are traveling only with hand luggage.

"Since we were traveling with golfbags I phoned Emirates in Amsterdam requesting for a Van or MPV to pick us up for our transfer to the airport. A few hours before pick up time we received a call confirming our request and indeed we were picked up by a van. Smooth check in, we could hand-over our golfbags to the groundstaff who delivered them to the special luggage desk. Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants. We asked them in the beginning of both flights whether they could synchronize their service as much as possible, and this worked perfectly. Cabin crew were very nice and attentive. On both flights the food was plenty and of good quality.",Promoter
"  I booked this flight (Hong Kong to Singapore) with British Airways frequent flyer points, travelling on Cathay Pacific. I paid for Premium Economy onboard an A340-300 but due to an equipment change we were rebooked onboard regional business class on a Boeing 777-300. As a OWE member I used the Pier First class lounge which was superb, really enjoyed it there and dined on a three course lunch and several glasses of Verve Clicquot champagne. We boarded via the priority queue 30 minutes before departure. We were warmly welcomed onboard and seated in 14A and 14C and the seats were recliners arranged 2-3-2. On sitting down we were offered drinks, I took a glass of Billicart Salmon champagne. The menu on offer was: king prawn and asparagus salad, followed by a choice of pork noodle soup, beef and orzo pasta or a tea set. We chose the latter two between us and both were decent rather than good. Hagen Das ice cream was offered for dessert. I also had a further three refills of champagne which was most welcome. There was a good choice of films and I watched Independence Day 2 and an episode of Family Guy. My wife was asked to fill in a passenger survey. She was given a $HK50 onboard duty free voucher for completing this, however it wasn't used as a minimum spend was $HK600. We arrived on time and immigration was swift.

My trip on Frontier was great even with the delays I had, but how can I say something about it if there was snow covering the airport. the truth is that my plane had an hour delay but arrived to destination just 5 minutes late.

I am a 6 feet 200 pounds guy and felt comfortable. the size is the same as the one you will have when in the back seat of a sedan. The crew was amazing, yes we do not have a screen in every seat but that was easy to fix. I downloaded 3 movies in my cellphone and enjoyed top amenities thanks to Netflix downloads.

Toronto to Barcelona return in early August. Worst overseas flight I have taken. When I compare Air Canada Rouge to regular Air Canada it's like night and day. The seats on Rouge are very uncomfortable and cramped. Inflight entertainment is barely acceptable. In order to access it you have to own an iPad or rent one on board. The movies are old and out of date. On the return flight from Barcelona to Toronto there was garbage (including used napkins and food) from the previous flight still lying on the ground when we boarded. It was filthy. One of the bathrooms was out of service for the nearly 9 hour flight from Barcelona to Toronto. Every time the seatbelt sign turned off when there wasn't turbulence people rushed to the bathrooms that actually worked. Flight attendants seemed very young and inexperienced. I will try to avoid Air Canada Rouge in the future. They charge the same airfare as Air Canada regular except you're getting an inferior service.,Detractor

"I've flown Thai in 2001 and I've flown with them again. Nothing much has changed, aside from the newer planes and IFE. The rest is about the same. When it comes to service and resource management they still haven't quite got it right. At PKT check-in, they decided that each counter would have it's own queue. That confuses me since they were for the same flight and this split queue system is known to make wait times very inconsistent. Ground crew seemed very shy, and were not keen on speaking to us, or at least they were so quiet we couldn't hear them, and the same was observed for the cabin crew, who also seemed somewhat distant. Their IFE looks like it's 10 years old, and is due tor an update, despite the system being touchscreen. As for positives, the plane was delayed, but it did arrive on time, so I'll commend them for that, and food is reasonably good. Better than the slop that Cathay Pacific serves to passengers.",Passive

Amsterdam to Singapore via Helsinki. Approached this flight with some trepidation after reading a lot of negative reviews on this product. Well it's definitely not Emirates but it also was not a bad experience for me. The connecting flight from Amsterdam was fine. A tiny curtained off Business section with economy seating with middle seats left vacant. A pleasant dinner good Champagne and on time. From Helsinki to Singapore was one of the old A340s (OH-LQA in this case). First impressions were favourable with the cabin being spacious and clean. We had pre flight drinks and a snack and left on time. Once seated I tried the seat out and it's more of a recliner but seemed ok. Menus drinks and dinner all happened smoothly and quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed my supper. It's a bit of a no frills offering but enjoyable and had nice wines also. IFE is poor. The screens are tiny and the offering is limited and old. Didn't really matter as I wanted to sleep as much as possible and despite the seat being at quite an angle I managed a few good hours. Breakfast was simple but tasty. So overall the experience was a good one - on time fed and slept well. If you want the deluxe business experience it's not this but as a lower priced business option that keeps me out of economy it does the job admirably.,Passive
" My wife and I had booked a return trip Adelaide to Frankfurt via Doha over Easter. A few days before departure Qatar offered an upgrade to Business Class for the 2 legs and we decided to upgrade for about $2500 for Adelaide Doha.

On the nearly 14 hour flight from Doha to Adelaide we each had a row of seats. The A350 which Qatar uses for the 14 hours long haul, has a 3x3x3 configuration which made sleeping possible. But economy class food left a lot to be desired. I was served lamb in apricot sauce which was so dry that I think they forgot about the sauce. For the brunch I opted for the Cheddar Cheese scrambled egg and this was also very dry . However, the desserts served were of a good enough standard.

This was our first time flying with Air Canada Rouge (from Vancouver to Maui and return). We had read the reviews of Air Canada Rouge and they were so horrible that we were really apprehensive about flying with them. However we did not experience many of the bad things other people seem to have experienced. One of us has a mobility disability and we had excellent service from the staff in the airport who met us with a cart and took us through from one end to the other. The plane was a half hour late leaving Vancouver as we were waiting for some passengers coming from a connecting flight that was late. Our take off on the way home was however right on time. The plane was clean. The staff were young but they were friendly and attentive on both flights. The food wasn't great but it was adequate. We rented an ipad and watched a movie on the flight to Maui the entertainment was adequate. We only had two complaints: Firstly the communication over the intercom was poor quality and the information was relayed so quickly we could not understand a word they were saying. Secondly the seats were extremely uncomfortable. There was virtually no space between our knees and the seats in front of us. Our seats were also very narrow. This total lack of legroom makes for an uncomfortable flight especially on an all-night flight when you are trying to sleep.

The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa.

Another problem I have with them is that the crew uses the overhead bins for their own luggage leaving practically no room for their so called â€˜priority customers' which are seated on rows 1&2. Food quality and quantity is also on the decline. If flying in Europe I try to avoid them and prefer LX and OS which are both owned by LH but have much higher standards.,Passive
"Delta Sky Club admission policy is inconsistent. If you fly in first/business domestic in the afternoon and then fly international the very next morning, all within 24 hours, you are not entitled to use the Sky Club lounge. However, if you make the same flights all in the same day, you can use the Sky Club lounge. Now, even if the policy is inconsistent, you would hope the lounge staff could use some customer-friendly judgement and make an exception to let you in. No such luck at the DCA lounge. So much for goodwill. Sent an email to Delta customer service. We'll see if they are any better at dealing with customers. Next time I have a similar itinerary, I'll try a different airline.",Detractor

CGK-UPG on economy class A330-200 and UPG-CGK on business class B737-800. CGK-UPG trip was nice their newest A332 product has been improved well. IFE was good but movies must be updated with the latest. Food was ok though too small in quantity. Both leg FAs very attentive. Always smile. UPG-CGK on their newest business class really enjoyable. IFE was fine movies selection are better than the Economy class. Seat was comfortable. Food was great but expected a little more in quantity since it was Business Class. The price paid was awesome! Got 25% off by Student ID Card on my business class ticket. Definitely fly Garuda in the future.,Promoter
VIE-FCO-CAI and back. The Flights were horrible. The stewardess don't speak English just Italian. The food was a joke: on the second leg (FCO-CAI) a 3.45 hours flight you get a slice of raw meat and a slice of Cheese and a Fruit salad. The seats have minimal legroom and are not cushioned well. On an 3.45 hours flight no entertainment. Even no overhead screens. The security instructions were shown bye the flight attendants. Please avoid Alitalia even when the price is good.,Detractor
In the last month I've flown Spirit 3 times and another in a week. All from Houston to ATL KC and Tampa. Yes they do charge $10 to pick your seat and the seats are rather uncomfortable when you compare pricing you will find that after you have checked 1 bag per person and have paid the random fees most airlines charge you they come out a lot cheaper. I recommend you print your passes before you get to the airport as they charge for every little thing if you need anything. My first flight the flight attendants were excellent they had a very funny safety presentation. That flight I flew in the base seats and it was rather uncomfortable. After my ATL flight I decided to upgrade to the big seats up front. They were very comfortable and very roomy. They are worth it. My flight to KC was delayed 2 hours. I joined the $9 fare club which paid for itself the first flight as I save an average of $40 per flight on tickets and luggage. I will say that there is merit to some of the bad reviews above but if you want or need to fly cheap Spirit is a quality airline and as I said before I read before I buy and Spirit has an average airline fleet age of 4.5 years which is 10 years less than the more popular airline. They do allow you to move seats next to your party after take off if you don't get seated next to your party. I booked my latest flight to Tampa for 8 people a week ago 2 weeks before travel and for 8 people 5 in the big chairs and 3 in the small seats it was around $1100.,Promoter
" Flew to Istanbul with British Airways on 5th June. At the passport/visa check desk, presented printed boarding pass to the BA lady - my wife was holding the passports. The lady looked at the boarding passes and barked 'Passports' as if she did not see my wife holding them. Second bark: 'Do you have a visa?'. Third bark: 'Show me'. Fourth bark: 'Next'. No smile, no 'Hello' or 'Good morning'. Hardly any eye contact either. If anything, the situation was worse at boarding. BA recently introduced a boarding-by-group-number system. All such systems need to be policed, but there are ways of policing the arrangements. Some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call. When caught by the gate keeper, they were told, 'Not Yet'. Some attempted to board prematurely more than once. On the second attempt, the staff told them to wait. Accepting that the system must be monitored, BA gate staff should be better trained how to deal with (potentially) anxious passengers and reminded that not everyone speaks or understands English.",Detractor
Singapore-Melbourne B777. I've previously said I'd never fly with them again but this time I had no choice so I owe them an update. The flight was OK food wasn't outstanding. Breakfast was awful.

IB524 LHR-MAD IB6827 MAD-GRU Generally commendable service. On the first leg business largely means having the seat next to you left free but the meal and service were perfectly acceptable.

"Ukraine International from Gatwick to Almaty via Kiev. Very strict hand luggage allowance enforced at Gatwick, resulting in me checking in an additional bag for 75 Euro. Ironically, being a member of the frequent flier club I am allowed additional hand luggage, but I did not know this at the time, and, it seems, neither did the over-zealous check in agent. After rearranging luggage and waiting a long time at the service desk I was advised that the flight was running an hour late, but my connecting flight should be okay. European flights operate a ""Sky Cafe"" service, where food and drinks could be purchased. I did not do this but did get a free cup of water. The crew were very welcoming and open, and tried to help answer people's questions about tight connections. In Kyiv I was rushed to the gate for the flight to Almaty, which was held late for me it seems. There were not many passengers on board so everyone had 3 seats to themselves, but the comfort was not bad even though legroom was less than on the Boeing 737-900s. Complementary meal served on this flight by kind crew, acceptable airline food but nothing particularly special and no choice. Both bags were missing due to the tight connection. They arrived on the next day's flight but the ground handling agent said UIA were the only airline that did not deliver missing bags to customer's addresses so I needed to go to the airport and collect them myself. I like the good connections and often good value fares between Europe and Kazakhstan offered by this airline, and friendly crews, but I am annoyed by the attitude of the Gatwick staff and their seeming lack of knowledge of airline policies.",Passive

"  Seoul Incheon to Bangkok. A mediocre uncomfortable flight distinguished by minimal service from start to finish. The unpleasant experience starts with the cumbersome and unfriendly Asiana website and the difficulty in pre-selecting one's seat, One pays a premium airfare and OZ does not support the pre-booking of a seat. I connected to OZ from an AC flight which required me to seek out a transfer desk at ICN. It is unacceptable that OZ does not allow the Star Alliance airline which has issued the ticket to also issue the connecting boarding pass. A good 20 minutes was wasted sorting this out. Then on to the lounge. Upon entry I thought I was at one of the domestic North American carrier lounges: Crowded, nowhere to sit, no food to speak of, and a line up at the poorly stocked beverage section. At least North American lounges are usually well lit and not dingy dark noisy rooms. Hardly the place I wanted to be after 20 hours in transit. I walked around the ICN terminal until boarding of the flight. Onboard the service was minimal and disorganized. Although a 6 pm flight there was no pre dinner drink service. Instead, there was rushed meal service that lurched to a halt halfway through. After hearing so much about the quality of food, I was rather disappointed, as it was of poor quality. No top up of the wine glass either. The IFE system was nothing to brag about. Uncomfortable seat although the large pillow was appreciated. Overall, Asiana is on par with a US airline international flight which is nothing to be proud of. The quality of service was not good and the value was not there.",Passive

" Singapore to Berlin via Doha. The ground service in Singapore were not up to the standard I expected. Food on board, I understand that there is limited choice. However the system serving food is weird, I was surprised being in the middle of the plane and finding out that the row behind me was served 40 minutes before me. So at the end as the last people who were served we didn't had a choice of the food. The cabin crew were nice, polite and friendly. They tried their best even if the company didn't provide them enough of tools to make their work excelent. The last issue was getting back my bag. I was in shock when i get my suitcase damaged. I went and reported it right away, I got report and everything was alright. At Tegel Airport I was informed that i have to call company DOLFI that works with Qatar Airways to solve the issue. That's what i did and here i got another suprise! Lady on the phone told me that she can't help me i have to contact airline. I did as she said, customer service informed me that they don't deal with this kind of cases and i have to contact airport crew. Again nice airport manager send me back to DOLFI. And finally everything ends here after 1 month. The issue of suitcase was solved, however it was such a poor service, staff in DOLFI is not informed about their duties, which cause misunderstanding.

Arrived at Toronto and was told onward flight to Sudbury was ok so proceeded to hand in baggage for connection. Later we found that the flight was in fact cancelled and they then refused to give our bags bag. We were told by Air Canada to go to Section N. There were people here who had been in the queue for 4 hours not having an idea what they were queuing for and later finding out it was in fact for hotels not flights. After calling redial for 2 hours we gave up got a hotel ourselves and proceeded without our bags. When I rang air Canada they told me to go back to the airport if I needed them urgently. Our return flight from Sudbury was also cancelled and flight to London delayed heavily both without any notice or customer communication from Air Canada. We had also been told that if we required a special meal there was only one meal available on the first flight. I rang once being on hold for an hour the second for two hours and both without response. When I got to Pearson airport I immediately asked if something could be done about it the Air Canada person told me it's too late it has to be 24 hours before.

There was not even an incline of understanding from her or an eagerness to help me in any way whatsoever. Will never travel with them again!,Detractor
"Flew to London Luton from Copenhagen with my sister in November. We both had certain expectations on how the flights would turn out and we were to say the least: Anxious. However, we both got surprised on how smooth and painless everything went. Since I work as a travel agent I knew of all the ""hidden"" fees and everything you need to do prior to your arrival at the airport, so check-in etc went very smooth. We chose to purchase the priority boarding queue which turned out to be totally worth it, we had lots of room while we were in line since most people used the regular line, which was very comfortable. We boarded a little late, which we we prepared for so no harm there and once we got on the aircraft the cabin crew were very friendly and even funny. The security briefing went by very fast though.

" Luton to Prague with Wizz air. On the way out there they got us all on the plane. Pilot announced 20 minute delay. Then we continued to sit on the plane for 90 minutes. Staff didn't seem to know what was going on, there were no other announcements. No apologies, nothing. We tweeted Wizz air asking for an update and they sent us a link to a website that said our planes original take off time? Helpful- I think not. Pilot then tells the crew we are taking off still no apologies, no reason given but we did actually take off. The worst part was we had a late night flight and were meant to arrive at around 9.30pm. We landed just before 11.30pm and our check-in for our apartment stops at midnight. So we abandoned our original transfers to get a taxi so that we could arrive with 5 minutes to spare otherwise we'd have had to sleep on the street. We thought this might be a one off. But no. Flight home they got us all boarded onto the buses to go to the plane and then kept us there for an hour and a half, the website did actually say delays but then didn't update when it was delayed a further hour. We finally got to the plane and took off quite quickly this time. We landed home two hours late and our parking had expired. But at least on the way home they did finally apologize when we landed and said the 'airspace was busy' for two hours?

"  We flew to Riga from Gatwick for a family holiday in June, and used Airbaltic, We were over an hour late due to technical problems with the aircraft at Riga and a change of aircraft was needed. However we were further delayed by the so called ground handling company at Gatwick. This company delayed the already delayed aircraft by not having gate staff on duty at the gate. We left Gatwick nearly two hours late, however we arrived in Riga 45 minutes late, and were able to make our train with about 5 minutes to spare. The aircraft was clean and comfortable. The cabin service was slick and both the cockpit and cabin crew were apologetic for the delay and were able to make up time on the flight to Riga. The prices onboard are reasonable and the range of snacks and drinks very good quality. The return flight was on one of the new CS300 aircraft and I was very impressed with the cabin interior.

The cabin has mood lighting and a inhouse monitor about the size of an IPhone in the seat lighting panel. The overhead lockers of a size that would hold 3 standard size cabin bags with ease. Again the cabin service was slick and the crew were happy to upsell extra drinks and food when passing though the cabin. The only negative side to the flight was been held at Riga for 45 minutes due to ATC congestion in the London Area. Both the cabin and cockpit announcements were clear and informative.

Returned from Iceland to Ireland via London Heathrow last Thursday June 19th on Flight FI454 from KEF at 16.10 At 4.30 informed that the flight was now confirmed to take off at 17.00. No announcement was made no explanations given and no one from Icelandair appeared to answer the passengers questions and concerns. Flight eventually took off at 17.20 and was further delayed at London Heathrow due to a time slot to land. The pilot on welcoming us on board explained that the delay was due to a member of the cabin crew becoming ill and a replacement crew member having to be got. He also apologised for the delay. I was to originally have 2 and a half hours between landing in Heathrow and taking off again on a connecting flight to Ireland. I barely had an hour to get off go through passport control rush to baggage reclaim check in for connecting flight go through customs and get to the boarding gate. As it worked out I just got to the boarding gate in time and this was due to two factors. One was that there was no queue both at the check-in desk and at customs and secondly the cabin crew on flight FI454 allowed me to move from my allotted seat in the 2nd last row to a seat in row 6 near the exit door for the last 20 minutes of the flight and so allowed me to get off quickly. My sincerest thanks to the cabin crew. This was my 5th return trip to Iceland on holidays since 1991 and using Icelandair each time. This particular experience has left me wary of using Icelandair again and of considering using alternative airlines in travelling to Iceland on future trips.,Passive
I was supposed to fly direct from Indianapolis to Washington Dulles Sunday Sept 14 on UA3726. When I got to the airport I was advised the flight had been cancelled earlier that day. The ticketing agent said there were no available flights so I was stranded in Indianapolis until the next morning. She was unwilling to offer any hotel or any other compensation. The only available flights the next day had layovers instead of being direct. I took a United flight easily from IND to ORD the next morning. However the flight from ORD to IAD on UA382 was horrible. We boarded the flight late because there were so many people on standby. Then we sat on the tarmac for over 2 hours because they said they needed to refuel. Supposed to land at 11:39am but arrived after 1.30 pm.,Detractor
Star Alliance Gold Million Miler. I recently flew from Los Angeles to Montreal on Air Canada connecting to my Rome flight on Rouge. I must tell you I was terrified to fly Rouge after reading all the reviews. I was seated in Row 27 directly behind the Exit Row with 2 seats next to the window. I will start by saying that the experience on Rouge was good and comparable to other airlines in Coach Cabin (not preferred Seating or Economy plus). The recline was average and leg room fine I am 5'7' and was able to stretch my leg under the seat. The flight was full and the crew did a nice job with meal and drink service. I would definitely flew them again not my first choice but will fly them again if necessary. They did recognize my Star Alliance status and early boarding.,Promoter
"  I am so sorry to report what a big, and I mean big disappointment this was flying First Class with United Airlines from Kalamazoo, Michigan to Oahu via San Francisco. We paid an additional $2500.00 for these seats and only once did we go left rather than right. Only once did we actually have a place to put our feet, only once did we not have to sit and watch 200 plus people board and crash into our seats, and only once did we have television screen to watch a movie. Also not even a pre-loaded movie device was provided on our way home from San Francisco to Chicago. Also on that flight, even though we had the first two seats on the plane, when breakfast was served, I received oatmeal instead of the omelette that I had requested. For the premium price we paid, this was not at all what I was expecting. So very disappointed in United Airlines.",Detractor
"  New York JFK to Frankfurt. My wife and I were seated in 32E/F (middle of centre 4 seating with our backs up against the toilets and galley). There was no way of reclining our seats and very little leg room. This was bad enough for a 7.5 hour flight but as soon as we were in the air the passengers in front of us reclined their seats, the backs of their seats came back to very near our faces. Also with their movement we got our knees whacked. What really gets me is that we paid for what comfort Economy Class offers but this was Sub-Economy standard: we would have had more room to move in an animal crate in the hold. Trying to read or use a laptop was so awkward that we had to give up. The laptop could not be opened more than 45 degrees. We hit some turbulence along the way and were told to buckle up. After a long period of no turbulence my wife had to go to the toilet, as soon as she got into the aisle she was told in a very commanding voice to sit down. This happened again later on when the need was desperate. Still no more turbulence and again ordered to sit down. While this was going on the toilets further up the plane were doing business as usual. Don't the cabin crew care about the health of passengers?",Detractor

And then on top of that another 3 hours. The attendants in the airport are of no help, and don't listen to what we have to say or accommodate our needs. They didn't offer to explain the services.

" Copenhagen to Paris. Avoid this airline at all costs. They randomly block some people checking-in and have pathetic copenhagen airport staff. I had booked an Easyjet flight on 27th Feb, Copenhagen-Paris, time: 20:25. While checking-in, i was first told that i had arrived early so I needed to wait to check-in. Exactly one and half hours before the boarding time, i was told i won't be able to fly because the flight is overbooked. Then, as i asked for compensation to pay for the overnight stay, they said that the compensation is not given immediately but in some weeks. I can understand that the flight was overbooked. But, what i fail to understand is the airlines responsibility. How can they randomly pick up few passengers, block their rights to check-in, and don't even bother to pay compensation immediately. Everything about Easyjet was like a nightmare. Uneducated and extremely arrogant easyjet Copenhagen airport staff. For instance, informing the passenger in advance, if not, then paying the compensation immediately. Why should a passenger suffer because of their mistakes.",Detractor

" Medellin to New York via Bogota. I write this on the return leg of my (almost) monthly JFK - MDE - BOG commute. I have avoided AV for the longest time but now that their nonstop from New York to Medellin is a daily frequency, it's the easiest connection. The convenience just about outweighs the indignities of the AV experience, though one wonders why this airline is so consistently unpleasant. The unreliability of their operations is of course well known, not just because of the temperamental Colombian climate (which finally might be addressed with better navigation equipment) but also because of notorious ramp delays. A combination of both delayed my MDE to BOG flight, endangering my connection to JFK. At the last minute, a stony faced attendant in the lounge moved me to an earlier flight. Both international flights ran on time, which is either an improvement or an exception. Their A330s now have pretty comfortable lie flat seats. The in flight service is minimal. While the meal quality has improved from inedible to edible in an emergency, the wines remain bottom shelf supermarket. And their practice of blaring advertising into the cabin from boarding till take off is one of the most head ache making, customer unfriendly practices I have encountered in 40 years of flying. Another bizarre practice is their habit not to announce in the lounge when flights board (particularly inconvenient because their boarding times are always moving targets). Ostensibly, that's to avoid noise pollution. Instead, they announce every five minutes that they are not making announcements. Same pollution, just without informational value added. That's Avianca logic for you.",Detractor

Kuala Lumpur - Bahrain and Bahrain- Paris CDG . Gulf Air A340-300 on KUL-BAH flights are dragging them down in their star ranking compared to the more spacious A330-200 on their BAH- CDG flights.

Return flight from Los Angeles to Orlando. Checked in very early and upgraded to Main Cabin Select. Upgrade includes a checked bag a free head set and unlimited food drinks and movies on demand onboard. The extra leg space was a God send / see previous review. Flight was not completely full but still slight delay in departure plus a very long drive around LAX to a runway on the other side of the airport. All female inflight staff were efficient but lacked the warmth of the crew on my outbound flight. Capt. came on early to discuss weather issues en route which was greatly appreciated as the flight took a long strange journey to Orlando and arrived about 15 minutes late. The crew on this flight did not make an announcement for last calls before they shut down the ordering system and unlike the first crew at some points gathered in the rear galley to chit chat. Crews on both flights did not tidy up the restrooms which were always in great demand. I highly recommend upgrading to Main Cabin Select especially for cross country flights on Virgin America.,Promoter

"Flew Veuling Airlines from Rome to Palermo on July 19th and it was not a good experience. Arrived at airport at 10:15am for a 2 pm flight and took 1.5hrs to check in.

Flights from Perth-KL then KL to Bangkok return. 4 flights 1 was fantastic. The rest were very disappointing. Even a 3 star airline should be able to provide clean seating and toilets.

This was most unusual considering at check in they would have had to match my colleagues boarding pass to the name on his passport. Consequently my colleague had to return to the service desk to sort out the mix-up. Boarding was smooth and o board the aircraft appeared well kept. Following take off we were offered drinks and then lunch. I was seated in the second row of a very lightly loaded business class. When I told the FA what I wanted for lunch she apologetically said that they had run out of that choice. The meal I settled for was well presented but lacked taste. The dessert was dry and inedible. Wine selection was okay but I would have liked more choice. The seat was reasonably comfortable and allowed me to have two hours of decent sleep.

"  New York to Ankara via Kiev. My complaint is about the insufficient management and indifference of the cabin crew against an uncomfortable situation created by passengers.

They were still standing and getting their cabin bagage while we were landing. The problem is that the crew did not seem any interest to manage the situation, except one lady to whom I asked to take control but she was too delicate to warn them so I had to argue with these people for 10 hours because they were jeopardising our safety standing at the exit gate, disturbing me by continuously passing in front me, making rumour and didn't let me sleep.",Detractor

We were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time. The member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we would be able to claim compensation. For us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the Lake District the following day.

At once the ground service clashed with me because he wasn't able to recognize my e-ticket on his computer system. Although the ticket is created by their system. How come this to be my fault. Most of the time I travel with one shoulder bag to avoid the ground services, I prefer to deal with a screen and software rather than dealing with them.

"London City to Granada. I've flown with BA a lot over the years, most recently in Business and First and have, until recently, always had a favourable opinion of them. I recently used Avios to take a short break to Granada with my brother. My normal choice for such a short flight would have been economy because I don't believe the extra cost (whether this be actual money or Avios) justifies the perceived benefits. Regrettably, no economy reward seats were available so I opted for Club Europe. The only real benefit on this particular route was the increased baggage allowance, although this was of no real use for a 3 to 4 day trip! So what did we get for our 'business' flights no lounge at City Airport, no fast track at City Airport, a 'holding pen' prior to boarding with everyone standing around in a small room and no priority boarding. Seats in Club Europe are identical to those in Economy. The breakfast going out was terrible (burnt food along with dried out toast and croissant). The lunch (if you can call it that) coming back was also terrible - a cold salad dish with dried out rolls accompanied by vinegary wine. No lounge at Granada, No fast track at Granada, coupled with a single check-in desk most of the time and long queues I complained to BA about this - the initial response was that Club Europe left the middle seat free to allow more room. Whoever responded obviously didn't even think to check the aircraft, as there is no middle seat on the Embraer - it's a 2x2 configuration for the whole aircraft. After some considerable persistence on my part, a partial refund of 5,000 Avios each was provided by British Airways. I recently had the choice of flying Club World to Hawaii (BA to LAX and then AA to HNL) but given the fact that British Airways Club World can be quite claustrophobic, ultimately decided to try out Qatar Airways new business class to Thailand (via Doha) - by all accounts their business class is comparable to British Airways first class.

" I flew from Toronto to Geneva (with a stop in Montreal) on an A330 and returned to Toronto from London Heathrow on a Boeing 787-9. Air Canada has changed its economy class setup and now charges $60 each way to check in a suitcase on long-haul flights. This is by far my biggest gripe - one of the main reasons I choose to fly Air Canada is that the fare used to include all the essentials, unlike many of their competitors. Sadly, AC are starting to go down the nickle-and-diming route. Surely everybody who goes on a long transatlantic flight needs to check in a suitcase, so why not just include it in the airfare like before and spare everyone the hassle? This makes the online check-in process much longer and more cumbersome, as billing address and credit card info. all have to be entered as well as everything else. Very annoying and pesky. You also no longer get to choose a seat at the time of booking and instead have to wait to see what's available when checking in, though I wasn't too annoyed about that. Bag-drop at Toronto Pearson was fully self-service - I was even able to place the suitcase on the belt myself without any staff being present. The flight to Montreal and then on to Geneva was on time. Unlike on many newer aircraft, the older A330 has the advantage of having nice wide seats with excellent legroom and good seat cushioning. The IFE was okay but not quite as good in the newer cabins. Unfortunately I was seated in the middle of the aircraft by the washrooms, which was very bothersome on an overnight flight. The stopover in Montreal is a curious setup as I had to get off the plane, wait at the gate, and then get back on it into the same seat about 1.5 hours later. The cabin service was usual Air Canada - generous with the drinks, less so with the food. The pre-landing snack of a small slice of banana bread was inadequate. The return flight on the very new 787-9 was pleasant - the seats were not as narrow or as firm as I feared they might be. The IFE was better than on the older A330, though still not as good as some other airlines'. Cabin service was the usual - pleasant enough. On both flights, the captain and first officer stood with the cabin crew to say goodbye as passengers disembarked, which I thought was a very nice little touch. Arrival at Toronto Pearson airport was the usual complete disaster - we had to sit for over an hour until a gate opened up, and then they couldn't get the bridge to fit properly. And the usual pandemonium at the baggage reclaim, but none of this was AC's fault. Overall, perfectly pleasant flights and very glad that AC has finally got rid of their ancient 767s! I just wish they would quickly get rid of their new baggage fees for long-haul flights.",Passive
"  A wonderful experience with KLM, which is our favourite airline. We booked a city trip from Vienna to Helsinki via Amsterdam with KLM. Everything worked as smooth as it can be. Fast and simple online checkin, on time departures of all four flights, cabin crew amazing. On the return trip, one of the flight attendants continued with us to Vienna and she was happy to see us again and we felt treated really special. The economy class service on KLM's short and medium haul is exceptional, and the shorter legs (VIE-AMS) we were served a tasty sandwich/wrap and hot and cold drinks, on the longer legs (AMS-HEL), we got a hot sandwich and two rounds of drinks. On the return flight they served a regular hot meal (pasta with tomato sauce) and a dessert. Transfer in Amsterdam efficient, arriving to C7 and departing from C8 was really convenient. For all flights, the atmosphere was very pleasant and the crew members looked like they enjoyed their work.",Promoter
"We flew from Heathrow to Kos on Tuesday 13th September departing at 07.25. As the flying time was between 3.5 and 4 hours long, we had contemplated flying Club Europe but with identical legroom to the economy seats, it didn't seem worth the money. We checked in around 05.15 and having previously paid to reserve our seats, everything went smoothly as most of terminal 5 seemed very quiet. I had tried to find out in advance what food (if any) might be offered on the flight as we would have preferred not eat breakfast at 06.00 in the terminal. However, despite knowing people that work for British Airways, it seemed quite difficult as the web site is rather ambiguous. Having said that, I did find out that the food offered depends on what band your flight is classified as but try as I may, I couldn't find the LHR to Kos on any of the bands. In the end we had tea and toast at Gordon Ramsey's which was expensive but a lot quieter than the other outlets serving breakfast. Boarding was on time although we did have to catch a bus to somewhere near terminal three which took around 10 minutes. The plane seemed little more than half full which obviously speeded up boarding and we left a little early. The cabin crew were polite, friendly and efficient and we were offered a sandwich and a drink for breakfast, which was fine. As we had a spare seat in our row of three, it effectively meant that we had the same space as Club, which made the flight a little more comfortable. We arrived a little early in Kos after a slightly bumpy landing but we were through customs and had our bags within half an hour. Overall a good flight and BA must have a tough job selling their Club Europe seats unless of course passengers want to, pay hundreds of pounds for lounge access and a hot breakfast.",Promoter
 I am a FF with American Airlines and have been satisfied with the overall performance of the airline during this time of inclement weather. We arrived in CLT on the evening of Jan 7th and found our flight to PHL was delayed. The delay became longer as the planes for the 20.00 and 22.15 from CLT to PHL were both delayed or grounded elsewhere. This was an issue for all flights with some customers being delayed more than two flights. AA solved the problem by using a larger plane that held the passengers from both flights to PHL. We arrived later than we wanted but our bags arrived with us. AA did a god job in tough conditions.,Promoter

" I had a flight from Bangkok to Paris (France) via Dubai. The transit was supposed to last 1h 30. With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours. We finally reached Paris the day after. Fortunately we could spend the night in a hotel. And we could get the final flight the day after, where all the blankets were gathered in front of emergency doors. And of course with a delay. Emirates, never again.",Detractor

The airline do not provide this but arrange it through the airport and whilst at Bristol the service was truly appalling (see my airport review), the service at Faro was excellent.

" Tel Aviv to Manchester via Helsinki. Was my first experience with Finnair. The seats are nothing exceptional: a tray, a coat hook and seat pocket. They are rather comfortable and the pitch is surprisingly generous. I am 177 cm (5'9"") high and had ample legroom on both A320 and the smaller A319. The cabin crew were polite and at welcoming. Took them more time to pick up my empty food tray than I'd like to, but it was a minor issue. There were no blankets on the seats, but the flight attendants provided them on request. Meals were offered only as a pre-ordered option for an additional charge for my flights (â‚¬15 for a hot meal and â‚¬7.5 for a cold one, depending on the flight's length). I've chosen to try both types out of curiosity and to keep me from starving on a connecting flight: meatballs with cream sauce for a hot meal on the TLV-HEL flight and Korean-style chicken salad on the HEL-MAN flight. Both were quite nice and I've finished them all. Blueberry juice as a drink option is a nice touch. Choosing it is a no brainer - it's delicious! Overall it was a pleasant experience and a decent value for the money. If I fly a long-haul flight in the future, I'd consider choosing Finnair, but that would depend on the price compared with their competitors.",Promoter
The ancillary fees are plainly excessive. From bag charges small luggage allowances (40lb instead of common place 50lb) plus the fact that carry-on is charged for completely negates the base price is low. On a business trip from Europe our transatlantic fare included luggage fees was less than flying from Florida to Las Vegas with Spirit. We had no chance of printing out boarding passes and were then charged for that too. If there are any other way of going from A to B I will not fly this Company again.

"An excellent experience. Flew Aegean Airlines from Istanbul to Athens, then from Athens to Paris. The crew was pleasant, with attentive service. It was a relatively short flight of 1.5 hours but they managed to fit in a meal service and a drink service. The food was standard regional economy affair - pre-packed snacks and nothing exciting, and there was a reasonable selection of drinks. The cabin was clean, and relatively new. The seats were much better than what I'd expect in short-haul economy. As a gold member I was able to book a seat in the first six rows, which has much more generous seat pitch despite being in economy. Because of the slimness of the seats, even seats further down the plan had plenty of legroom. The only criticism is disembarkation in Athens. Apparently most ( if not all) Aegean flights park on the tarmac, and you need to get on a bus to get to the terminal. This obviously takes more time than desirable, but a small drawback in otherwise an great airline.",Promoter

I rang from for an attendant but, whilst waiting, an announcement came to say it was 40 mins to landing and the stewardess said they couldn't sell duty free - I believe this was because she saw my vouchers.

When questioned the Qantas staff answer was I had bought a separate ticket for her and I had confirmation document to prove them wrong. The staff took no ownership and repeatedly said it was not their error and we were sent to 3 queues while my daughter was crying fearing separation. I had to have hard talk before they changed their mind and finally we were sent via Qantas. After reaching Sydney, we waited almost 1 hour with many other passengers and our baggage never arrived? We had to go and question Qantas staff and they said to lodge an entry with baggage services and we did it accordingly. When questioned as to why they didn't inform us, the staff said they too didn't know. Worse part us there was no apology and staff treated us as trouble makers.

One our second flight my seat didn't recline I was promised at the start of the flight that they could manually do it after the meal was served so I thought that was reasonable after the meal however they told me it couldn't be done I would just have to accept it. So for an 8 hour flight I sat upright with a baby on my lap as he wasn't allowed to use the bassinet most of the time because of turbulence. However our toddler slept in his aviation approved car seat that their telephone service agents said we couldn't use. I think their customer service needs improving they tried to tell me I needed to buy 2 seats to use one car seat for a toddler whose seat I had already purchased.

"Montreal to London and return to Toronto. O/W leg from Montreal was the most average club experience to date. Poor third party lounge with little food choice, disappointing wines and little ambience. Boeing 787-800 aircraft was substituted by Boeing 787-900 which was good on the face of it, except the same seat number moved me from the last row of biz to the one in front of the toilets - annoying as gate staff unable to move me. With the air bridge withdrawn, the plane went tech due to a power issue. Two hours later after a total reboot of the aircraft systems we took off. Excellent updates from captain. However, cabin crew were absent during the delay with Biz passengers including me having to ask for a glass of water. Bizarrely First was blocked off with lights off and vigorously enforced with no access to the front bathroom. Drinks and dinner served promptly. My choice of fruit for breakfast had already run out. Only 4 loaded for the whole of biz with honey and yogurt offered which turned out to be a 99 cent pot plonked on a plate. No croissant offered (left in oven in error) and the orange juice has been downgraded to UHT out of a carton. On the return leg from Heathrow T5, the club lounge was very disappointing. Shabby condition, poor food and drink service by the third party provider, with dirty / scruffy toilets which I had to queue for. Worst lounge experience to date and cannot be called first class by any means. Prompt boarding on a 777-200 with the first entrance blocked off. The cabin manager was by herself and so we were pointed towards first class. Friendly crew, prompt champagne and a prompt drinks service after take off. recovered things a tad. IFE had not changed since my flights in October which was disappointing. The amenities bag in first is now the old club world offering. Average menu with the usual suspects of Beef, Chicken and Cod but were cooked and presented really well. The promised cheese plate had already run out - only 4 loaded. (seeing a theme here) and so cheese was fetched from club. Afternoon tea sandwiches were dry and bland. In the race to the bottom, BA continue to cut service - especially on the food front. I don't find it acceptable in first class for something as simple as cheese to run out with club food being substituted. This may save money (and wasted food) but the crew whilst cheerfully making the best of a bad job are not being given the food or or product to deliver first class service. In fact, the crew were the only saving grace. BA don't seem to get it. Even in premium cabins, they continue to downgrade service to save money and gain an even worse reputation as the UK's flag carrier. Biz and First Class products are dropping at an alarming rate.

Had the opportunity to try out the new Business Class product on LX due to the Thanksgiving week premium fare sale EWR-ZRH A340-300 on the way out A330-300 on the way back. Seats were roomy for C with only 4 or 5 across (depending on row) made for lots of living and storage space. My only complaint was how low to the ground the seats were in bed mode - you felt every single bump. That said it did an excellent job providing privacy and blocking out any ambient light. Service was highly professional and pleasant flight attendants where everything from meal service to mid-flight beverage requests was quickly responded to with a smile. Passengers were addressed by name and as far as I could tell every member of staff spoke English in addition to Schweizerdeutsch (and a few French as well). I highly recommend trying the Swiss speciality entree for me it did not disappoint. IFE was a mixed bag. While both aircraft type feature AVOD the A340's system appears to be an older generation - clunky interface long load times and the system froze on me (necessitating a reset) twice. The A330 has a newer system better interface and a larger screen although with the same limited selection as on the outbound flight.

" Bengaluru to Mumbai. As part of the Christmas and New Year vacations, I had decided to fly with Air India on this morning flight but unfortunately the flight was overbooked due to which an additional charge had to be paid in order to upgrade to Business. Even though there were rumours to the effect that the staff were trying to get the pax fill in the business class even though seats were available in Economy in order to gain as much revenue during the holiday season. Fast forward into boarding and even though the departure time was 8.50am, we only started boarding after 9am. Then there was a further delay of around 1 hour in the aircraft pushback so the flight actually departed at around 10.40am which was not expected and disappointing. The Business Class seats in themselves were pretty good and the in-flight service was exceptional with a welcome watermelon juice drink, crew being engaging, friendly and personable. For Breakfast, I had opted for the cheese omelet which tasted very good along with coffee and croissants. The pilots tried to cover the lost time enroute which was admirable and soon after landing, disembarkation was smooth and the luggage was received swiftly and promptly. Air India is a pretty solid airline and compared to other carriers such as Jet or Indigo, it is pretty solid and stable, if there has been one thing that has been holding the airline back, it's the on time performance which has been lagging considerably behind it's competitors.",Passive

"Flew Goteborg to Amsterdam through Copenhagen with SAS. Flight delayed 1 hour, and then it turned into 90 minutes. My connection flight delayed 15 minutes so that I would arrive on time, but still had to rush and run through Copenhagen airport. The staff at Goteborg airport was very communicative through all the new announcements, provided all the times of the next flights available if our connecting flight wouldn't be made, or guaranteed they'd book a new plane for us from an other company if needed. However, once in Copenhagen, we had to run around by ourselves to find where our connecting flight was, and we only had these 15 minutes to do it, so we were basically given up after being reassured all the way back in the first airport. Oh well. Flew a propeller aircraft for the first 30 minutes flight, had leather seats. Were comfy but would probably end up giving backache if the flight was longer. Next flight was a bigger plane with more room. Seats weren't the same leather one but regular. Free coffee and tea served during the whole flight. Bought an expensive sandwich to try scandinavian tastes, didn't feel much special - more like a service if you're starving. However the crew does accept four different currencies aboard, and accepted to give back my change in euros after paying in crowns, which was pretty cool. So, yeah. Despite that shaky experience, while I prefer Finnair, I would still fly SAS if the tickets are cheaper.",Passive

"  We flew American Airlines AA207 from Milan to Miami. Air conditioning in row 20 to 25 did not work, it was that cold that people were complaining and asking for blankets which were not available. Even after many requests from different passengers nothing happened. When I asked the stewardess to send her supervisor nobody showed up. Cabin crew gave the impression to hate their customers. Headphones were of lowest quality. Entertainment program was the same to and back from Miama.",Detractor

Following all the negative reviews of the transatlantic service I was somewhat nervous about our London Gatwick - JFK return flights. However I have to say that the whole experience was as good as economy class air travel gets these days. Norwegian is using the budget airline model for this service so if you have to be realistic in that you will either have to pay for everything or take it yourself (drinks snacks pillows blankets etc.). We did a combination of both. All the staff we dealt with were professional and polite we travelled on the Dreamliner both ways which was comfortable and had no issues with the entertainment systems that others have described. We were delayed on the return leg of the journey however this was not the airlines fault as someone had checked a bag and then not turned up for the flight we had to wait while their bags were removed. My only negative comment is that Norwegian put the time of the return flight back by several hours after we had made our reservations. Although we had a lot of notice of this and were offered the option to cancel the flight we were unable to re-arrange our plans as we had already booked connecting flights etc. As we were travelling with young children this was a real pain. It seems that when the transatlantic service works it is great if you can avoid the teething problems!,Promoter
Great flights both to and from Portugal however the queues at Faro airport easyjet baggage gates were very long. This however may have been caused by the Portugese security which was jam packed. The catering on the flight from Portugal to Liverpool ran out of warm food and other popular items less than a quarter of the way along the plane. The gift selection suffered much the same fate because we were informed the outward flight from Liverpool to Portugal was busy and had used up the supplies. Not a good idea to rely on the catering. better to eat before boarding.,Passive
Rome-Manila via Riyadh and Jeddah on return flight. European legs were ok - cabin crew services and attitude of staff. Legs to Asia were in all these fields poorer and staff spent most of the time chatting together. All this is just minor problem comparing with transit. Especially Jeddah airport is one of the worst I have seen in 15+ years of frequent travelling. It is probably one of most passenger unfriendly airports there is simply no space to wait in transit lounge. People are sleeping on cold ground toilets are extremely dirty.,Detractor

"  Washington to Boston. This airline is fine should you not actually want to go anywhere. I felt like I was in kindergarten with a make-believe airline. I booked through Emirates. Foolish me, instead of booking a direct flight out of IAD with Emirates, I thought to save several hundred dollars by booking a cheaper flight with connecting JetBlue flights through BOS and JFK. Big mistake. I should have paid the premium for an Emirates only booking and completely avoid JetBlue. Flight staff have the friendliness but incompetence of high school interns. Weather delay I understand. I drove through the rainstorm. At the check-in counter, I specifically asked the staff at the counter if I would make my connecting flight to Emirates in BOS. He responded that the connection was tight but good. Wrong. At the gate, just before boarding, I and four other people were informed that we would miss our connections, and needed interline tickets. The staff at the gate spent an hour on the phone getting interline tickets for the other four passengers, and when she got to me, then after another twenty minutes on the phone, she informed me that I had just missed an interline ticket with Qatar Airways by fifteen minutes, and could only go the next day - a loss of 24 hours for me. She talked to me in the nicest department store customer service voice, but was incompetent. I missed a whole day on my vacation. JetBlue should have booked the interline ticket immediately at the check-in counter when they had told me that the connection to my Emirates flight out of BOS was tight. Returning connection JFK to IAD. I landed at JFK timely with Emirates, and put my checked bag on the connections check-in counter, and proceeded to JetBlue Terminal. I saw on the Departures Board that my connecting JetBlue flight from JFK to IAD was several hours away, but that there was an earlier JetBlue flight. I asked the staff at the Help Desk if I could get a boarding pass for the earlier flight. He asked me if I had a checked bag, and I replied that I already had checked in my bag at the transfer connecting flights counter. And so then he said that ""no"" I couldn't get an earlier flight because my bag was already checked in for the later flight and was going to be on that flight. Okay, fine. I understand. So I took my originally booked flight, my first actual flight on a JetBlue aircraft, which took off about two hours late (being a small discount aircraft flight at the very end of the day, I kind of understand that.) Upon arrival at IAD, I looked and looked for my checked bag at Carousel 10. After many bags went by, I looked around the carousel, and saw my bag sitting inside the JetBlue baggage office. It had come on the earlier flight! So here I am at Dulles at two o'clock in the morning with my bag, calling for my pickup ride, when I could have been calling for my pickup ride at a more civilized hour in the early evening! I specifically asked the staff at the gate if food would be provided onboard the aircraft. I was told ""no."" So I stocked up on some snacks at the nearby snack kiosk. Needless, I was served cookies and Sprite onboard. I shall never book JetBlue again.",Detractor
"This was a bmi Regional operated flight on a RJ145 from Manchester to Heathrow - but with a BA flight number so I have to report it on here. On boarding the cabin crew member didn't look up to check our boarding passes or welcome us. No check on seatbelts etc. prior to takeoff. The service started soon after takeoff since this was a very short flight this consisted of a trolley with drinks and snacks - as is usual on BA Domestic services. There were 5 men in front of me returning from a weekend break who were given 2 gin and tonics each and the cabin steward was very friendly with them. He got to me and stared I stared back I took it he had forgotten to say ""may I offer you something from the bar"" or something similar. I asked for an orange juice and that is exactly what was thrust onto my tray. I asked for ice I got one lump splashed into my juice reluctantly. None of the rest of us were offered a further drink but then we didn't expect it on such a short flight. No goodbye to most on departure just a grimace - but that didn't surprise me.

"  Air Canada Rouge. Sounds nice somehow, but that's all it is. A nice sounding brand. Should be renamed to Air Canada Rough. First leg between Boston and Toronto on an old battered Embraer. Dirty and absolutely worn out. On the plus side I have to mention that they actually had free WiFi. Made me have good hopes for the second leg. Toronto Budapest. But what an illusion. An even older 767-300. The seats felt like a taxi in Sofia. Entertainment system? I asked the purser where they had hidden the touch screens. He told me that I had to use my own phone to be able to see a movie, or rent an Ipad. They had wifi he promised me. Then I looked for a USB, to able to charge my phone. Non existent. However there were 110v power outlets. For those with American plugs on their chargers, or the one with adapters. I didn't have one. But it wouldn't have helped me much, as there was one one outlet for two seats. This is a 9 hour flight. Food? Could choose between chicken and pasta. The chicken dish was not tasty and sad looking. Breakfast was a cup of coffee and something that might have been a carrot cake. One bite and I'd had enough. Thing is, this is not an budget airline. Prices are premium. They are supposed to compete with Lufthansa, BA and American. I thought TAP was the worst transatlantic carrier - until now. Next trip will be with Norwegian on a Dreamliner.",Detractor

" Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced United's version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than United's experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above United's, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding, while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly. I wish that cabin seat space for Economy passengers could be maintained, given that the vast majority of us travel this way.",Promoter

"Flew SA235 from LHR to JNB in business by spending some Star Alliance miles. Check-in at T1 was quick and easy with the boarding pass reflecting my pre-chosen seat. Star Alliance lounge at T1 is still awful (no fault of SAA) heavily overcrowded at peak times and under-lit. Priority boarding a bit chaotic but once on-board staff were quick to provide refreshments and help out with baggage etc. Pushback was delayed 30 min due to the usual evening take-off traffic jam at Heathrow which the staff kindly used to serve another round of drinks. Upon takeoff food and drinks were served quickly and food was surprisingly good. I got the last of the ""lighter"" meal choices though and was seated up in row 3 - not sure why their algorithm assumes that most passengers would be keen for a heavy beef stew or rich chicken curry right before trying to sleep on an airplane but there you go. I would recommend pre-booking the veg meal or sitting right upfront if you want to have something lighter before sleeping. After dinner I managed to get pretty comfortable in the A340-600 flatbeds and slept for a good 6 hours in total. I believe the A330 has the newer interior and also operated the LHR-JNB route but the seats in the A340 were adequate for sleeping. Only real disappointment is the ICE system as the screens are very outdated compared to some competitor airlines - however this was not an issue for me as my goal was to sleep as much as possible in this flight. Flight arrived 30min early in JNB despite the 30min delay on takeoff and pilot did a good job of avoiding most of the turbulent weather which he warned us about on takeoff so all in all a very nice flight.",Promoter

Seats were okay for first hours during flight, however after second to final hours of flight, the seat could not provide enough comfort and lumbar support to rest (unlike for example SQ or EK which adds much comfort to their seats).

"Fantastic flight in Club World with British Airways from London Gatwick to Punta Cana. On time departure from Gatwick on a 777-200 - it's true the plane was showing its age with a little wear and tear in the cabin, but seats 2A and 2B were comfortable and functioning perfectly. Greeted by friendly mixed-fleet crew and provided with champagne and amentiy kits before take off. Prompt lunch service after departure and a varied menu with excellent wine choices. I enjoyed a goats cheese and honeyed walnut salad, followed by steak in a port wine sauce which was well cooked and tasty. The delicious Castelnau brut rose champagne was available but disappeared quickly so I recommend ordering this promptly. As this was a leisure flight, all champagne did run out about 3 hours in, for which the crew apologised sincerely, but there was plenty of red and white wine available including an excellent Chablis and Medoc. The Club Kitchen was well stocked throughout and manned by a friendly and personable crew who were always willing to help. Plenty of juice and water runs throughout and a very pleasant afternoon tea served an hour before landing. Bathrooms were well stocked and cleaned regularly. The entertainment system was great in Club with a decent selection of new release films, though the screen resolution could be better, especially Wilhelmina the cabin lighting is on full.

"  Washington to Johannesburg return via Amsterdam. I chose KLM for this trip because of an extremely attractive price offered at the time of booking. The price was so good I upgraded to Economy Comfort which I believe is worth the extra cost. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, I deplaned and set about exploring options for occupying my 3-hour layover. After using the facilities and finding an open seating area for some relaxation and online activities, I discovered that my cell phone in its clip-on holster was missing from my belt. Panic set in an I retraced my steps and searched wherever I had been. I checked in with Lost & Found and while sympathetic and very helpful, they did not have my phone. What a depressing start to my safari adventure. I resigned myself to the likelihood that my phone was gone and I'd have to pay to replace it upon return to the USA. I boarded my connecting flight and had just gotten settled when I was approached by one of the flight attendants who held out an object in a plastic bag and said, â€œI believe this is yours.â€ Life was good again. The phone had come un-clipped sometime during the first flight and fallen between the seat and the outside wall of the plane (I was in a window seat). The cleaning crew found it and turned it in along with the seat number where it was found. KLM staff researched the flight manifest and found my name and then looked up my itinerary and determined the next flight I would be on and forwarded the phone to the flight attendants on that flight. Now, that's what I consider service. Thank you KLM. I would also compliment KLM on the food and staff service. Both were great.

  Tampa to Cleveland. Spirit Airlines is one of the worst I have seen for customer service. We were scheduled to take off from Tampa at 3:15 pm. and before being picked up by a car service we doubled checked our flight and were told that it was on time. Upon arriving at the gate we were informed that our flight was delayed 2 hours. After waiting 90 minutes we were informed that the flight was cancelled. Now the good part starts. We were herded like cattle down to the ticket area and then herded again over to a remote area so that we were out of the way and wouldn't make a scene. The entire passenger list was standing in line and were being dealt with one at a time. This was a very long process and it could have been avoided if they would have announced that they were only giving refunds and no assistance to fly out on another flight. After standing in line for two hours they made that announcement and handed out cards with a number to call to get your refund. By this time there were no taxis available and we were stranded. The only thing left to do was call a car service and pay another $50 to get a ride back home. We are now out $100 for car service and Spirit could care less. I phoned for my refund and was told that it would arrive on my credit card in 7 to 10 days or at least that was what I thought I was told. 10 days passed and no refund. I called again and got another agent that was a little better to understand but not by much. He informed me that my refund was never applied for and that he would process it for me now. Finally it hit my account. Why can't these companies pay Americans to do their customer service work. Waiting to book another flight and try to get a reasonable price on a short notice is frustrating enough and then to put up with people that you can't understand adds to the tipping point where you want to choke someone. I will never fly Spirit Airline again because I believe that they have no consideration for their customers and the hardship of having their travel arrangements disrupted.,Detractor

A good flight, entertainment didn't work that well and no WI-FI on board, but the most important feature is the seat allows you to sleep.",Passive
Vienna-Belgrade-Vienna. Have flown this route 3 times within the last months. Flights were always completely full. I found Austrian a good airline to fly with: cabin crew always very caring and polite flights always on time: you can see they are Lufthansa. What is more I really enjoyed the new Recaro seats. The only drawback are the aircraft's being used: the turboprop Dash I had the chance to fly on twice is quite noisy and pretty uncomfortable.,Passive
Travelling Etihad Airways from Athens-AbuDhabi-Sydney was terrible. More crowded than domestic seating seat allocation changed for no apparent reason and my wife and I stuffed into Seats B/C with A occupied when only 60% full. I moved to another unoccupied E aisle seat with 2 vacant spots beside me and during middle of night for unknown reason flight attendant installed 2 more people next to me. Unbelievable. Checked our original 2 seat allocation and it was occupied by one child under 6 with spare seats next to her parents in middle seats. Unbelievable. Never Etihad Airways again.,Detractor
ZRH-CPH on A319 super cramped seating and I'm not even tall. Seats are aircraft shows age and are filthy in my opinion. Crew ranging from cheerful to arrogant. Good thing is the complimentary coffee/tea. As a national carrier it's not impressive but they get you from A to B.,Detractor
"  Orlando to Charlotte. No one at check in desk in Charlotte when there was a very long line. They comvince you the prices are low and then charge the same amount as the flight or more to have luggage -- even carry ons! And then to get a specific seat assignment, they charge more. The flight to leave Charlotte was delayed because of storms (a fair reason) but no explanation was given for the two hour delay on the return flight, which we were only informed about when we were in line to check in for the flight from orlando. It appeared that our plane first thing in the AM, was coming from California. No food or drink is served without charge in the plane. Seats are harder than usual. Tray tables are teeny (not really a problem without food, I suppose.) No plane wifi. If they are going to present this as a discount flight, they need to charge an actual discount price. I could've paid the same to Southwest and carried more luggage and been much happier, and maybe one of my flights might have been on time. I will say the cabin staff was kind of great. Less formal and more likely to joke around and be pleasant in an honest way.",Detractor

We flew from Toronto Pearson to Varadero Cuba 27 Jan - with all the negative reviews on here I was ready for problems. Arrived at the airport at 4 am for our 6.15 flight - we had bought Elite Plus - walked right up to the counter and was checked in immediately - plane loaded on time we were the first to board as stated with the Elite Plus - even with de-icing we were in the air quickly - food is typical plane food no better no worse. Luggage was off first so it was waiting for us when we went to pick it up. Return flight was the same boarding no problem - 1/2 hr late not worth even mentioning. Crew were polite and friendly captain kept us informed. These planes are no bigger or smaller or the food any different than any other airline.,Promoter
" Copenhagen to Washington via Frankfurt. Flew the same route in Nov 18, and was pretty impressed. However, today's performance was far from stellar. First of all the LH website is probably from the 1980's, because it sure feels that way when using it. The long-haul flight was very average, to be generous. IFE did not work. The PA system worked in business class only. I had ordered an upgraded dining experience, and if I had been served what I had ordered, I would have been much happier. WiFi did not work onboard this time. What really made the whole thing bad is that everybody was confined to their seats for the last 2.5 hours of the flight due to very strong turbulence. I like Lufthansa, but if this is what they can offer, there are much better options.",Detractor
BKK to RGN to BKK: A great choice to fly to Yangon Myanmar with. Their tickets price is cheaper than TG and I am very impressed with their service. Check in has no fuss people with the airline gold card and internet checked in passengers can go to a faster lane. This is especially handy to know for Yangon airport where the check in queues can be quiet long and easily take 30 mins or more. Aircraft is clean in excellent condition and one class only crew are charming and helpful. For a short flight little more than an hour free meals were offered and taste quite good too with metal cutlery not those cheap plastic ones. All in all I am very impressed with Bangkok airways will not hesitate to chose them again for flying to other AESAN countries via Bangkok.,Promoter
Chicago to St. Louis round-trip. All flights were on time with friendly service. Midday in Chicago I cleared security in 10 minutes. Mobile boarding pass is very helpful. Boarding was quick and easy. Flight operated by Shuttle America E-170. The plane was very comfortable with lots of legroom in standard economy. I am 6' and had no problem. Return was equally as easy. St. Louis security very quick. This flight was operated by Trans State ERJ- 145. It was fine for the hour flight but anything longer would have been unpleasant. Narrow seats and aisle less legroom low ceiling seats falling apart very loud engines and lots of turbulence. Flight attendant very nice. Arrived 20 minutes early. The cost was definitely worth it over driving or amtrak given the punctuality. No inflight entertainment was offered on either flight which is fine for such short flights. I arrived an hour be fore both flights but could have got there much later. I recommend United and usually don't have issues with them and plan to fly them again in the future.,Passive
"I was travelling Ethiopian Airlines to Lagos from London via Addis Ababa. I bought 2 bottles of perfume and 3 books with some chocolates at the duty free shops. When I got to the gate, I was shocked to meet a very hostile Ethiopian Airlines staff there who said I was now over my baggage allowance and I was told that I had to pay for excess luggage or miss my flight. He was very rude when I tried to explain myself to him. I had never experienced anything like that with any other airline before. What you buy at duty free shops airside shouldn't count as excess luggage, especially when it's not excessive. Otherwise why are the shops there? I had the receipts as proof that the items were bought there at the airport but he didn't want to hear anything I had to say. He shouted at me everytime I tried to explain. So I had no choice but to pay. Is this right for airlines to make passengers pay for excess baggage for duty free goods bought at the airport? I have given the ground service rating 1 star because there's nothing lower. They don't actually deserve any star at all. The cabin staff were good.",Detractor

"PUS-PEK in a B737-800. Plane not new but clean and inviting. Departure on time (also due to generous turnaround time in Busan) arrival in Beijing ahead of schedule. Flight not fully booked thus our middle seat fortunately was left empty and provided some extra comfort. As in many Asian airlines the announcements in English were too low and mostly incomprehensible certainly a risk for emergency situations although you rely on the fact that this is not your first flight and you know the ""rules"". Lunch was served on this flight of almost two hours two standard options decent food - absolutely ok for economy class. The Chinese (white) wine they served is strange to European palate but you almost feel like Robert Parker and keep tasting and discovering. Overall impression of the crew was positive: polite and efficient not eager to talk. Limited IFE with overhead screens just the usual equipment in a 738 of about five years of age sufficient for a short haul trip.",Passive
"Flew TAP Portugal from Barcelona to Rio de Janeiro and on the way back from Salvador de BahÃ­a, both ways with a stopover in Lisbon. Short haul flights were okay. The problem was both long haul flights, especially from Lisbon to Rio. We flew on an A340 which had relatively new seats and inflight entertainment. 3.5 hours before arriving in Rio we were told that we were not heading to our destination, but had to make an emergency landing in Natal due to a medical emergency. Ok, no problem! If somebody needs to get to a hospital,I totally understand. I was expecting a short stop of about an hour or so. We landed, the ambulance took the ill passenger and after 35 minutes everything was over. But then came the main problem: one of the fuel valves was suddenly stuck and could not be closed and the plane could not be refueled. They kept us inside the aircraft for 5 hours unable to tell us when or if we would be able to continue our journey. It does not sound long, but believe me, it is terrible. After 5 hours we finally were able to fly on for the missing 3 hours of flight. Our journey was supposed to last 9 hours but we ended up being inside the airplane for more than 14 hours. On our way back, from Salvador to Lisbon, we had an A330. The airplane was terribly old, seats unconfortable, the cabin crew rude and unmotivated. My inflight entertainment seat did not work and the cabin crew did not do anything about it. I asked 3 times to please make a reset of my unit, but the only thing I received was a rude answer telling me to make a claim in Lisbon. What a great attitude. When I got up to ask for a glass of water in the middle of the night without anyting to do, the flight attendant made it clear that she was reading her newspaper and that I should come back in 10 to 15 minutes as her colleagues who are resting now would help me. Ok thanks and sorry for not letting you read your newspaper. Another important point is the food served: it is simply inedible. I tasted it but returned the whole tray to the flight attendant as it was absolutely disgusting. I thought I might be a little picky, but when I saw that other passengers where doing the same, I knew the food was simply bad. After all this, I contacted the airline to make the claim for the 5 hour delay on our way to Rio which was originally a medical issue but turned out to be a big technical issue afterwards. I am still waiting for a response and am not expecting to have one soon. I am calling them twice a week to get an update, but they have no answer. My recommendation is to avoid TAP Portugal for long haul flights. The ticket is expensive and the service you get is far better for the same price on other airlines. There are many other alternatives to fly to Brasil.",Detractor

"I needed to fly to Orlando for a conference May 16 2014 and booked on Air Canada Rouge because it was the only option on the day/time I needed to fly. I was not aware that Rouge was the new ""vacation line"" the term the flight crew used when I expressed astonishment at the lack of personal entertainment systems. As a business traveler I expect better options and was unhappy with the (lack of) comfort in the cramped seats the lack of power at the seats the slow food/beverage service due to the first 70 minutes of service dedicated to renting the i-Pads for movie/Wi-Fi. The crew were very attention and pleasant which was a nice surprise from the usual variable AC crew.

"  Flying from Atlanta to Richmond last night and I have never had a more unpleasant interaction with a flight attendant. Twenty minutes into the flight (after her and another stewardess sat back and gossiped) they began to serve passengers off of the beverage cart. After serving 3 quarters of the passengers, the attendant said ""Sorry, we are done."" I asked for a water and she said ""No, pilot's orders."" She later came by and asked if we had any trash to which I responded ""How could we, you didn't offer us anything?"" She asked if I was upset and I told her that I was because I just needed some water as I had traveled all day. She said to take it up with the pilot. At this point we still had half an hour until landing. Also, there was no turbulence. My Delta flier miles card is going bye-bye. You don't treat people like that.",Detractor
Sunwing has really raised the bar for airline service incompetence. Our most recent trip from Sudbury to Santa Clara Cuba was a testament to their inadequacy. We have flown Sunwing 8 times. I can understand weather delays so the flight being behind schedule wasn't a major deal. Forgetting to have the proper forms to fill out to enter Cuba on board that was a problem! The flight was already 2 hours late but upon landing in Cuba we had to sit for another 30 minutes while we waited for and filled out the visas to enter the country. Food: We had a choice of a questionable sandwich or a piece of cardboard pawned off as pizza. They used to offer a tray meal that was far better than this recent garbage. Departure from the terminal in Santa Clara was a catastrophe waiting to happen. Instead of an orderly boarding it was announced that the flight was ready to board. It was a free for all. The departure door was bombarded with people jostling for position. Our flight home required a trip through Customs in Ottawa and a re-boarding on the same plane to complete the journey to Sudbury. Approximately 40 people were heading for that final destination. After passing through Customs we were required to re-check our luggage and get new boarding passes. So forty people boarding and an intelligent guess would place the luggage total at about forty bags. Why then did only 20 of those bags get put back on the plane? That brings us to our arrival in Sudbury. After the connecting flight with the offer of a glass of water we were greeted with no luggage! We were prepared to drive to our home town in the morning but the Sunwing rep assured us that our luggage would be shipped on the first flight out of Ottawa the next morning. We decided to wait for the luggage in Sudbury. Our luggage didn't arrive until 2.30pm the next day! We will avoid Sunwing in the future.,Detractor
IST to Gatwick London on 25th as a Gold member with other Star Alliance airlines they did not provide a priority baggage handling tag. Lounge at IST was excellent but far too busy at least 10 mins to find a seat and another 10 mins to queue for the foods. If you want to have a shower you may need to wait 90 mins. From London to Istanbul on 30th I was not allowed to use the lounge not allowed to increase check-in baggage allowance and could not check my bags to my final destination. When I re-checked my bags in Istanbul they would not check-in my bag again to Melbourne only to Singapore asked me to re-check them in Singapore. After I arrived in Singapore I checked with ground staff of Singapore airlines who helped me to re-direct my bags to Melbourne and I did not have to do it myself again.

"  Los Angeles to Gatwick. A flight booked months in advance and then subsequently upgraded to Premium. Never mind that it was an additional Â£100 to upgrade over the phone due to the service not working properly online. Checking previous flights for the past few days - all OK, on time. Great. Get to the lounge early - OneWorld - excellent facilities and a perfect way to start our journey. Then the texts started coming. From a 2010 expected take-off Saturday, the short story is a delay until 0200 Monday. The key issue was having no ground staff to assist passengers, leading to a fair amount of emotion, uncertainty and pain in arranging own hotels, flights etc. Again, no doubt great when it goes well but with no network and no support, be aware that the costs come with a caveat that you are on your own should there be any issues.

Our flight was reserved as part of a AAA vacation package to Cancun Mexico. Had we known about the lack of free non-alcoholic beverages not being able to recline the seats and being wedged into a seat like a sardine I would have not flown with Spirit Airlines! Luckily our hotel had a working computer and printer for the boarding passes. Otherwise we would have had to pay at the airport for not having boarding tickets. And why did we pay to be in an early boarding group for the entire round-trip if our boarding group and the next boarding group were called to board at the same time? This happened at both legs to our destination and both legs from our destination! Luggage cost: Spirit charges $40 for a 40 lbs suitcase at the time of on-line check-in $50 for additional suitcases. We had three suitcases. Yes it's a bit cheaper if paying for suitcases at the time of reservation which we could not do because we booked through AAA. The cost per suitcase is even more for heavier suitcases and if paid for at the airport. Last I checked most other airlines accept up to 50 lbs per suitcase for about $25. By the way some airlines allow up to 70 lbs per suitcase for international flights. We and several other passengers almost missed the connecting flight from Fort Lauderdale to Baltimore. We flew in from Cancun picked up our luggage to take through customs and then followed the signs to the location for re-checking the luggage. No one was at the re-check location all of us had to go upstairs and re-check our baggage at the regular ticket counter. Having said all this the prices aren't that much cheaper and after all the nickel and diming the cost is nearly the same as other airlines. We rather pay a bit more up-front and have more leg room free water/soda recline our seats not worry about being able to print boarding passes at our hotel and have an agent on-site for luggage re-checking after going through international customs.,Detractor

The mattress is also a bit hard and is very uncomfortable for tall people the foot space that is very narrow and requires a lot off efforts to turn your body on the other side.. The grey design doesn't help as well: a bit boring. The amenity kid is just ok. The entertaining system is fine even thought he selection of film is not as nice as on other higher level airlines. The food is the only nice point: different choices of antipasti first course second course and dessert offered you on a tray: you can even taste a bit of everything. Also good selection of wines. The disappointing thing is professionally and the level of the service. I won't comment the ground customer service that is just shameful: nobody knows nothing or would better to say everybody gives you info that most of the time is just a personal guess. On board the service is a bit improvised and basically depends on the individual character of the attendant: if he/she is a nice one it all be nice. On the opposite if bad will be very rude.

" Los Angeles to Sydney. I really want to like and love AA! This was the return leg from LA booked on a Qantas code. Now originally I had been coming back on QF74 via SFO. However due to ATC issues in SFO three out of four flights leaving LAX were cancelled. Too their credit AA sorted the problem out and found a space on AA73 back to Sydney. That meant a bus ride back to T4 at LAX from one of the outlying terminals that AA uses. In addition a delay of 3 hours over the departure time of QF74. A separate review of the lounge at T4 but suffice to say I had a lot of time to kill. Books and phones help! Now the flight itself was on AA73 which is a B787 -9. Was keen to try this as it is the plane around which Qantas are building their future. Most if not all of my long haul is on the Airbus A380 with QF or EK. So the Boeing felt and was smaller.Ceilings were high and windows bit bigger but not as quiet as the Airbus. Being new everything had that new car feel to it! So the hard product is fine albeit I had better get used to it. It is the soft product where AA fails. On entering the craft the FA said: do I have to tell you where to go? The food service was hurried and without any real warmth. I appreciate that FA's are working in cramped conditions and so will always ask an FA how his or her day is going and smile. US crews just seem not too care, its a job for them and they just do it on auto pilot. The famed US levels of service with a smile have long since gone. The seat, 24B was a nightmare. Exit row but so narrow and uncomfortable. The Boeing 787 is probably OK for flights up to 9/10 hours but beyond that I would not take it.

The seats are beginning to show their age, but are still very comfortable (they provide you with a mattress, a duvet and an oversized pillow). The configuration was 2-2-2, but I heard that in the new aircrafts it is 1-2-1. The crew did a fantastic job, especially during the emergency landing in Accra to evacuate a passenger who had a stroke. They were very professional and friendly. However, as usual, the meals are nothing special and SAA should really look at the quality of their catering. Overall, a great flight thanks to the outstanding crew.",Promoter
 Syracuse to Atlanta. You would think that airline would work with you in cases of emergency but unfortunately that is untrue. Me and my husband were trying our hardest to catch a flight because his dad is dying and we wanted to make sure he got home to see him. We missed the check in time by 5 minutes and begged for someone to please let us on the flight. The lady at the desk called but didnt even mention our situation and just said rules are rules and I dont make them. Screw rules when there is someone's life on the line. Is an airline really not willing to help someone out who missed check in by 5 min. So he have to wait until tomorrow morning to fly out and we are praying that his dad can hold on until we arrive.,Detractor

PVG-DEL-PVG in business class. Both flights on A330s but different configs and service levels. Outbound flight was an older plane with 2-2-2 seats that reclined to an angle and did not lie flat. FAs went about their work perfunctorily. The food was very bad - both options were like an economy class meal in terms of taste and quality. They did not have a dessert cart. IFE system had a fair selection of movies. Return flight was better with a newer plane and lie flat seats. FAs were professional and pleasant and spoke English better than the outbound flight.

"Extremely uncomfortable flight! The cabin was very cramped with no leg room. I am only 5'11"" and my knees were jammed in to the back of the seat in front of me. When rows are that tight you shouldn't have the ability to recline - yet Rouge seats still have that functionality. They also charge for checked baggage ($25) which causes everyone to try and carry on creating an even more cramped cabin. Rude service no snacks. Cost was the same as a West Jet flight with the additional cost of baggage. Sorry Rouge you can't charge full price but then call yourself a discount airline so you can provide terrible service. The cabin couldn't be more cramped. Seats were so tight with zero leg room. Barely one person can walk down the aisle. Overhead bins full to explosion since they charge for baggage and with so little leg room people avoid putting things under the seat in front of them. Price for Rouge is same as regular AC flight. A total disaster!",Detractor

"  I flew Air China from London Heathrow to Hong Kong via Beijing return. I booked the tickets with Air China because they were extremely cheap at Â£340. I was prepared for a bad experience but I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin was relatively spacious in 3-3-3 layout, better than Emirates who use 3-4-3. The IFE system was pretty good with an alright selection of movies. Not as many as you might have on Emirates, BA etc but enough hollywood movies in English to entertain you for an 11 hour flight. There are about twice as many Chinese films as there are English. On my outbound the showcase film was Star Wars VII and on return it was The Revenant: a better selection than expected. Each seat came with a blanket and a pillow - the pillow was comfortable. Food was ok, choices of one meat with rice or a different meat with noodles and for breakfast a choice of Chinese (congee etc) or Western (omelette etc). The food and drink selection has nothing on other airlines but you get what you pay for. Flight were on time and flight attendants were attentive with good English and regular water services. On the return trip they lost my luggage in PEK. The bag was delivered to my home 4 days later but I had to make the calls to HKG and PEK Air China baggage offices to chase it up as the agent in London couldn't tell me even if the bag made it on the first flight.

When the flight was approaching (26.12.), it turned out that they had given our pre-booked and paid seats to family members of Finnair official, our seats we replaced without any notice to center aisle (4) seats, the worse seats in the plane, all economy, no economy comfort (which I had paid). Type of the plane has not changed or anything like that as Finnair Platinum customer service like to explain. Finnair customer service gave no apologies, just repeated that there is nothing they can do and ""what seats do I want"". Now, the family is spread around the plane next to the toilets and middle aisle. This kind of service is very sad, I wanted to prefer the national airline but now it is over. Have booked several overseas flights for 2019 already but now planning to change those to Star Alliance flights. Also Platinum membership is not worth it, eg. you really cannot use the upgrade vouchers which going to be expired since they are always in the waiting list and not confirmed.

"Alexandria to Kuwait via Doha. My flight from Alexandria wasn't very enjoyable. We did not have personal IFE, but the food was excellent. The seats were average A320 seats. On arrival to Doha we were brought to the terminal with buses - if you travel in the morning and noon, the airport is really empty at these hours. We arrived in Doha around 5pm. Hamad International Airport in Doha is huge, but its extremely easy to navigate through. We had a 3 hour layover but had to time to eat and buy some souvenirs. Our flight to Kuwait was short, but the Boeing 787 seats are crammed, and I did not like the food. It was a kind of pastry with either chicken or lamb and my pastry wasn't baked properly. On flights under than 1 hour earphones won't be given out. The cabin was clean, but the 3x3x3 configuration wasn't what I was hoping for. On my flight back to Doha, the same pastry was offered and I declined. I don't like the dimmable window shade that Boeing 787 aircraft have - extremely annoying to people trying to sleep at day-time. The flight attendants were grumpy on Kuwait flights. Our layover in Doha wasn't as long as on our inbound trip, but we still had time to grab a burger before proceeding to our gate. The airport was empty (it was noon) but be aware that you have to walk a lot (our gate was C13). On the flight back to Alexandria I had lamb and maybe the chicken option would have been better. On both my flights from and to Alexandria the food included fried vegetables, chicken/lamb, a small salad, and a piece of cake. In March I'm flying with Qatar Airways from Cairo to Oman, and I'm looking forward to their 777 cabin layout.

 Nassau to New York JFK. This is by far the worst experience I had with jet blue. Also like to fly with them but on the way back to the Bahamas there was engine failure. The flight was canceled. On top of that they wanted us to fly out the next morning to FL then catch a flight from FL back to JFK. I booked a non stop ticket and we wanted to get home. So we had to fly to FL and then go back to JFK the same day. Did not get in til 12:30 and got home at 2 AM. Called them up to see what they can do for us and they ended up giving us 175 per person credit. That will expire in 365 days and we have to fly with them again. This really did put a bad taste in my mouth after flying with them for so long. I don't think I would ever fly with them again. They can take the 175 credit and eat it.

LIS-LHR-VIE on Dec. 8 both legs on an Airbus 320 in Club Europe (Business Class) - both legs on time seats were Economy seats with the middle seat left unsold and featuring the new slim seats which are less comfortable and have a reduced seat pitch â€“ Check-in in LIS was handled by rather surly agents which was untypical for an otherwise friendly airport but Business class waiting lines were very short so overall it was OK. LIS-LHR leg was with a rather lacklustre and inattentive European fleet crew after the initial service of food and drinks further service consisted of clearing the dishes and on board sales. Other than that Business class flight attendants were behind the curtain reading magazines chatting and rather attending to themselves than the passengers. At 11 am the Business Class food served was a plate cold cuts a roll and three thin slices of fruit (basically a make yourself sandwich on a plate). Extremely disappointing and poor for a lunch flight scheduled to arrive in Heathrow after 1 pm. On the LHR-VIE leg service wasâ€œafternoon teaâ€meaning again sandwiches. However this time at least it was more appropriate due to time of day. Full bar service on both flights and the French white wine served was ok. The mixed fleet crew on the second leg was more interested in its job and up to BA standards regarding friendliness and attentiveness.

Spirit Airlines has the worst planning and customer support out there. Our flight to Detroit was cancelled due to the pilots being stuck in Dallas. We were waiting at the airport for over 4 hours saying the flight is just delayed and everything would be fine. Nobody was informing us of any updates. They finally cancelled our flight and tell us that the next flight out would be 6 days later. There's no credit there was no apology and the agent just kept reciting that it's not their fault. We waited in line at ticketing for another 2 hours and only two agents helped the entire plane. They kept having to go to the back to talk to the supervisor who is too busy to help the rest of us and kept sitting behind the scenes.

Last flight was from Boston to New York with an onward BA connection to London. Arrived at Boston airport for check in very rude AA check in attendant who was unhelpful and just plain miserable.

Finally ushered onto the aircraft at speed as we only had a window of 25 minutes to board and be airborne if not flight would be cancelled as the crew would be out of hours. We boarded the aircraft and took off with around 4 minutes to spare. Seatbelt signs stayed on for the whole flight and apparently due to adverse weather the crew would also remain seated so no food or drinks would be served.

After booking a flight from Christchurch to London via Hong Kong last year and being a long term Koru member we received what I can only describe as very 3rd class attention. Our flight from Hong Kong to London was cancelled after ANZ dropped this route as being unprofitable prior to March this year (travelled in May). We had to make other arrangements as LA was not an option for us. The alternative offered was Cathay Pacific who provided a truly super service. However one of the reasons my wife and I choose ANZ internationally was to be able to use the lounge facilities in Hong Kong going out and in London Heathrow and Hong Kong returning. It just makes the 22 hour flight more bearable. However during the dropping of the London - Hong Kong sector ANZ have made no alternative lounge facilities through any other airline and the code share at Hong Kong does not allow a guest since March this year. I understand the need to rationalise flight sectors but the poor way ANZ staff handled the change in my case is very disappointing and not worthy of a so called 4 star airline.

My destination was Hong Kong and I made it in less than 3 hours from airport to hotel.",Passive
Got the A380 from Dubai to Heathrow EK001. Loved the plane. Very new looking and swish! Toilets updated and cleaned regularly seats roomy and I am a big lady! Entertainment was great. Staff were a little harassed thought they were maybe understaffed as very different from earlier connecting flight. They still managed to get all the food delivered and drink runs done! Boarding was easy in Dubai despite this being or first venture outside of English speaking countries. Felt a little less special than at Adelaide but then that would be because in Adelaide we were the special ones at Dubai we were one of many! Plane was very quiet compared to the 777 a bit more clumsy on take off and landing though! I think this is more plane design issue. Food was outstanding. Very tasty and a lot of it!,Promoter
"  Albany to San Juan via Philadelphia. I am business owner, and if I ran my business like American Airlines I certainly would not last long. I was going to a business conference - however the company hosting the conference canceled because of the Zika virus outbreak. I called American Airlines, they said I couldn't get a refund, but I could apply this money to a different trip. Fair enough. Forward six month later and apparently they have no record of my credit to put towards another flight. I then go and book my new flight and put a complaint in that I couldn't use my credit. I get a call back and the next day and they now said I could, and that the only way I could apply this partial credit would be to cancel my current flight, wait 14 days for the reimbursement, then call them back to schedule another flight with this credit applied. Seriously, why couldn't you just apply to the flight I already booked that day, instead of having me jump through hoops. No thanks, I travel enough to where I will just pick another airline - don't care about paying more, its the principle of the matter. Goodbye American Airlines, you are not the only option.",Detractor
"Bangkok to LAX via Beijing was the worst experience in my several travels around the world. Air China changed our flight by over 6 hours without giving us a choice to re-arraign our stay. Due to the change we had to leave a paid night at our hotel and miss our last tour in the Phi Phi Islands. We asked for a refund since we had made changes to that specific flight so we could stay that extra day in Thailand, but we were given a number in China to call. We spoke with the manager in Bangkok who said we were going to be upgraded in Beijing and that we needed to go to the ""transfers"" counter - which does not exist in Beijing. No numbers to call within the airport and we couldn't go out to the counter to get our business class upgrade. We were told that no upgrade was going to be given since we paid for coach. We explained that we had already paid an additional $400 dollars to change our earlier flight to the original flight in the late afternoon so we wanted our $400 back. The manager continued to give us a number in China to call - and that was that. Never again will fly this airline. Liar agents, horrible service and rude flight attendants, makes you feel as if they are giving you a free lift to your destination.",Detractor
Singapore to New York JFK via Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific. Seat was very spacious with very good legroom. The entertainment system had a great selection of movies and TV shows. The first leg was operated by a crew that was a little bit disinterested and didn't seem to want to be there. The second leg with a crew that was warm and welcoming. They were very helpful when needed and had a smile on their faces. The food on the first leg was decent but nothing exceptional. The second leg had food that was much better.,Promoter

Our flight was delayed because the pilot did not feel comfortable landing in snow which was apparently coming down in Las Vegas? I verified that at the time it was supposedly snowing, it was actually raining. The gate agent was the rudest woman that many passengers said they'd ever encountered. She told us the flight might not leave, and the soonest flight we could get after today (Sunday) was Wednesday, so we could get a refund right away. Well, as we got to the ticket agent to get the refund, we learned the flight left with our luggage. They didn't care one iota, too bad, too sad. Lies, delays, rudeness, and then the agents started whispering, gossiping and laughing at us to our faces. The worst ever! Don't fly Frontier!",Detractor

The aircraft was tidy, well maintained and even smelled good. Crew attentive, perfectly groomed and extremely nice. Aegean serves hot meals in economy class - with a choice between meat and pasta, even in a 3 hours short haul flight, and it tasted fairly good. Chocolates and mints after the meal were a nice touch.

" The reason I am writing this review is to commend the flight attendants for their conduct during the flight. I fly this route frequently on business, and have experienced more positives than negatives. First, the flight was near capacity, as always. The flight was smooth, seat was comfortable, food was bland but palatable. However, the flight was anything but uneventful. Just before beginning descent into Moscow Sheremyetevo, a woman walking down the aisle to the bathroom approaching me appeared faint and collapsed. I and a couple other passengers kept the woman from falling hard and lowered her to the floor. This was when the flight attendants jumped into action. The head attendant coordinated the staff, helping care for the woman. They asked for a doctor on the plane and fortunately there was one. The woman appeared to be having a diabetic episode, and the doctor attended to the distressed woman in the seat behind me, assisted by the flight attendants. All during the incident, the flight attendants were calm and professional. They did an excellent job of managing the situation, especially during landing and deboarding of the aircraft, managing the arrival of medical crews to assist the woman, while at the same time ensuring the safety of the passengers. I was very impressed with the ladies of Aeroflot!",Passive

Then I paid for early boarding and when they cancelled my flight that got cancelled. I specifically asked for it back the lady told me I did not need it because I qualified for family boarding. I told her to make sure she assured us that I would not be placed in the back. That was a lie.

"  My partner and I flew Dublin to Seattle via London Heathrow with British Airways. Heathrow to Seattle was on a B777-200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped, making it impossible to sleep on a 9-10hr flight. Online check-in wasn't possible and we weren't able to select our seats as our booking had an Iberia flight number even though it was operated by BA. Made lengthy phone calls and same response was given that nothing could be done about it until the airport. Arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and I didn't get our seats together - ground staff could do nothing about it.

ZRH-YUL on A330-300. I was upgraded to Business at the time of boarding which was most welcome as I had had an arduous day of travel and this was my last leg heading home. Upon arrival at the door of the aircraft we were told to standby as the cabin was not ready which meant a congregation of passengers in the jet-way. I found this to be highly atypical for an airline I usually associate with precision. On board the seat was spacious comfortable and offered power ports for USB and 110VAC. The amenity kit was pretty basic but I liked the packaging which was designed to serve as a tablet/iPad case after landing. IFE had a good selection of movies with respectable size screens and good audio. FA's were efficient and friendly and came around often. Food presentation was good but taste not so. There was plenty to choose from for drinks albeit the wine selection was limited. Ice cream was served twice during the flight which made up for subpar food quality. Flight left late but arrived ahead of schedule due to strong tail winds and we were kept abreast of the flight's progress by the captain throughout the journey. Overall Swiss offers a good consistent product and makes you feel welcome on board. With a slight improvement in Business Class catering I would easily rate them as my favourite European carrier.,Promoter
"Delta Air Lines from Atlanta to Jacksonville. Flights in and outbound same day, DL 1258 and 1616. Both were MD-90's. The flights were fast. In the first case, I landed earlier than the scheduled landing time. On return, while we had to wait about 20 minutes to take off (for whatever reason), we still landed early. The only downside on the outbound flight was that the flight was so quick that beverage service couldn't be completed. Both flights were completely filled. However, by getting to the airport early for the return flight, I was able to get moved from a center seat to a window seat further up in coach class.

"  I have received a particularly poor experience from Air India and would like to pass this feedback onto other travellers as I don't want anyone else to suffer as I have done. Events as follows: 1) Outbound flight Mumbai to Goa - scheduled itinerary change, ie the flight was moved back - this didn't cause me a massive problem but was symptomatic of further issues ahead. 2) Return flight Goa to Mumbai - frequent scheduled itinerary change emails and an email for me to change to an earlier flight (by 13hrs). The changes reduced the window for my connecting flight back to the UK, however Air India said I would still catch the flight ok. Flight was actually delayed by 3 hours, consequently I missed my flight back to London. Air India said that because the flights were bought on different tickets they would not get me home. Additional flight purchased to London as a result. My hold luggage got to Mumbai but has been lost, hence, I have no hesitation in rating as Air India as a 1/10 and have since learned they are notorious, please be warned and do not be attracted by their headline cheap flights.",Detractor

"When things go wrong (which often they do when it comes to international air travel) Turkish Airlines simply are not equipped to handle it, nor do they have any interest. Their company is built with a front end, but no back end. Incompetent and rude staff hangs up and walks away in the face of concerned customers. Turkish Airlines uses confusion, bouncing their customers from call center to call center and desk to desk, playing them in circles until they tire and give up. Most of their flights connect through Istanbul airport and it is pure chaos. A shiny building and western style stores and restaurants do not make up for under experienced, under trained and the lack of an idea of what the concept of customer service is. This is something I experienced on a flight from Chicago to Istanbul 7 days ago. In the 7 day time span my bag has been ""found"" 3 times, even informing me of its location at the Sofia airport. I had confirmation from a Turkish Airlines desk, and their Call center. When I traveled there to gather it, I was told it was never there.

Needles to say on arrival in Shanghai the transfer option to a different airline had been cancelled I was transferred to a hotel for the night which was a reasonable standard hotel. No further comments on the outward Journey accept the food on the Manila Flight was something I could have got at a 7/11 before boarding it was a suppose worse as I had no choice once aboard.

This is our last leg of our flight coming from Canada to Philippines for our family vacation The airplane looks fine but nothing compared to our original flight, we supposed to fly thru All Nippon Airline (ANA) but for some delays in Canada it was re booked to Air China.

We ask them how this happened but they told us that they don't know, the only thing they noticed is that missing luggage is normal to Air China. Its true because when we claim our luggage after 2 days, there's other people claiming their luggage. So for every Air China flight there will be unlucky persons that will not have their luggage with them upon arrival. After inspecting our luggage's we found out that 2 of our hard case spinner luggage is broken. The luggage is almost brand new, this is the only second time we use it. And it will not break unless its not properly handled. No apologies from, they said its normal for a case to break. Again this is normal to them.

All the staff that I encountered on all flights were polite, friendly and very helpful.

Flew from Sydney to Bangkok via Jakarta in August 2012. Flight was on time. Plane was A330-200 and looked new. Seats advertised as fully flat bed although when lying down your legs were at a slight angle downwards. Plenty of leg room. There were 7 business passengers in the 2 business cabins (separated by Galley). Flight attendants were very friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Someone was always going through the cabin and any request was happily complied with. I could not fault the service and product received. Check in was very competent with a friendly male staff member.,Promoter

"  Flying LH1154 from Frankfurt to Palma. Boarding was fast, however there were so many families on that flight who were allowed to board before the normal economy passengers that I was one of the last people to get on the plane despite being the first one in the economy queue. Not a problem at all but a somewhat new experience for me, I have never been on a flight with so many families that it actually makes that big a difference. The ground staff and crew were very friendly. There was plenty of leg room for me (186 cm) and the aircraft was clean. There were drinks and sandwiches served, however, the sandwiches were small and not very tasty in my opinion.",Passive

The inflight service was very good, seats were OK, staff were quite courteous. The flight departed on time and landed a few minutes before schedule. The inflight entertainment in this particular aircraft was a bit dated, but worked nonetheless. Transfer in Doha was quick, no queuing in the security check. The A350-900 was a bit more comfortable than the B787, and the inflight entertainment was newer in this aircraft. WiFi was not free, and the price was very high, which is a big minus. The tickets were very cheap, and I'd say you get a lot for your money. Overall, I'm very satisfied.",Promoter
" Manila to Brussels via Abu Dhabi. The flight crews are more attentive and smiling in providing quality service to passengers. A big change from past experiences. I had a combination flight of Business (Manila to Abu Dhabi) then Economy (Abu Dhabi to Brussels). In both flights, service was almost impeccable. There was also an impressive and much-welcomed amelioration in the lounge for Gold members who can now access more exclusive lounges: if flying from Terminal 1, it is now the one beside the Al Reem, which is much cosier than the latter and the food choices are a plenty. If flying from Terminal 3, Gold members are allowed at the Business Class Lounge. Before, I would only have access to this lounge when I flew business. Now, on economy flights, Gold members are welcomed here. The only area that still need improvements are the ground crews in Brussels. You hardly find anyone friendly here in the past but maybe now, I probably was just unlucky to be attended by someone new. Nothing of what I requested was arranged and he was not aware of the protocol for Etihad frequent flyer members. But the one whom he consulted (I supposed someone more senior) was already much better when he assisted, much better than the usual staff you find in the Etihad Brussels counters. I just booked my children's flights with Etihad for January!",Promoter
" Extremely unprofessional and poorly trained staff. The departing time on the itinerary was different to the one on the boarding pass, we never received a notification and due to this we missed our flight. Not only were we provided with wrongful information without any flight time change updates but staff tried to convince me and my girlfriend that we were at fault. Claiming they could not do anything for us. We expressed we were not from New York and basically had nowhere to go, the response was â€œI'm sorry but there is nothing I can do for you.â€ We decided to talk to the manager on duty she allowed one of the representatives to be rude to us and basically gave us the same response. All JetBlue did for us was provide us with a flight for the following day and after spending all day out keeping ourselves busy and coming back to spend the night at the airport JetBlue said we had to come back the day the flight was departing (meaning we were not allowed to spend the night at the airport).",Detractor
"Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue.

"My wife and I had booked seats on a flight leaving Cancun Airport on Feb 21st with a connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale to LaGuardia Airport in NYC. This flight was delayed one hour in Cancun because of weather problems in Detroit. Delayed we eventually reached Fort Lauderdale but had to clear customs. Presumably due to customs- related delays in Fort Lauderdale the connecting flight to NYC took off stranding 101 passengers. We were not given any official explanation as to why the connecting flight took off without us. We were advised to re-book our flights and were told that the soonest available seats were for Feb 24th (72 hours later). For Boston the lay-over was 96 hours with the soonest available seats on Feb 25th. There was no management representation at Fort Lauderdale and there was a justifiably angry group of stranded passengers. When asked about hotel accommodations we were advised to find our own and that there would be no compensation. When asked about assistance in locating seats on other airlines we were similarly advised that they wouldn't be able to assist us. Since my wife and I weren't able to wait the 72 hours we spent the night in the airport trying to locate seats on an other carrier (which we knew would have to pay for). We got seats on a JetBlue flight the following morning paying the full non-discounted fare which was considerable. The major problem was the connecting flight not waiting for us to clear customs in Fort Lauderdale. Why would the flight not wait for 101 people? I've been flying for more than 40 years and had to wait on many an occasion for other passengers' connections and other reasons which is par for the course. This was an extremely poor management decision which showed a complete disregard for Spirit Airlines' customers. This was then exacerbated by the lack of any meaningful assistance rendered on the ground. I realize that Spirit Airlines is a ""discount (i.e. cheap) airline. However any successful business knows that its fortunes rise or fall with its customer relations. If there was a ""crewing"" issue (not being able to hold airlines staff beyond a certain time) this should have been anticipated in the airlines normal operations plan with staff back-up in Fort Lauderdale-after all this is the winter and hence presumably Spirit Airlines' busy season. This was our first trip with Spirit. However due to the airline's extremely poor management decision coupled with its complete lack of meaningful customer support I could not possibly recommend this airline to anyone. In general you get what you pay for but even a discount carrier needs to appreciate its customers especially in difficult circumstances. By the way I was going to discuss this matter on the phone with a customer services representative but they kept me waiting for 45 minutes.",Detractor

The food selection was good, and options available also good - we could not fault the service.

On February 19 2015 we flew to Santa Clara Cuba. Flight No: WG301. Returned flight was on February 26 flight No: WG301. On the way to Cuba we were served a meal accompanied with champagne. Nice touch. But on the way back they demanded $3.00 for a small bottle of water. I was in complete shock and asked a stewardess if we really are required to pay for the water. She confirmed that. Some time later juice and sandwiches were offered free of charge. That $3.00 bottle of water cancelled all the other pleasantries like champagne.

Hand luggage was slightly (about 1 inch) too broad but was never measured or weighed and therefore it wasn't a problem. Both flights about three quarters filled - all single travelers myself included got either a window or aisle seat with the middle seat left clear. Friendly staff and clean planes.

" Dubai to Southampton via Paris CDG with Air France and FlyBe (codeshare). Efficient check in at DXB and lounge in Dubai is the Skyteam lounge. The lounge seemed fine, efficient staff, modern look and clean. Snacks looked fine (though I did not try them) and reasonable drinks selection. Boarding on time, clean aircraft and good business seats. I chose Air France over BA on this route to try out an alternative. I have now flown a few times with Air France and rate them highly. However, on this middle east red eye flight, I feel that BA sleeper seats are better than those of AF. The service from the Air France staff was excellent though. Snack served after take off which was fine, breakfast was OK, BA serves better juices and coffee in my view, but the food component was good. Landed on time in CDG (layover of 11 hours). The FlyBe flight to Southampton was fine, friendly staff. All in all a good flight. What is not clear though and this was also true of AF ground staff is where these flights are sold as Air France flights on a business class ticket (and priced as such ), and then the short hop to UK is with FlyBe (which lacks a business cabin), we should still get access to the lounges of Air France (relevant if you have a long layover). In fairness to Air France, I had asked them about this in advance (told we would have access) and then when I turned up with my children today, the agent said, technically we did not have access. However, she used her discretion and let us in as we had flown from Dubai with them. Whilst I do not know what is right or wrong, its gestures like that which make me really like Air France. Their staff try very hard and ""go the extra mile"" . I lost my computer on my outbound flight and their ground crew found it and bought it to me.",Promoter

The 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow, a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. Cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness. Overhead bins are meant for hand luggage so why do EK allow passengers to board with excessive cabin baggage? I saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase, two bags of duty free, a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers. The passenger seated next to me was one of the last to board and had nowhere to put his hand luggage.

"I used to love Continental, the service was consistently above average and the flight experience was satisfactory, if not enjoyable. Since the merger with United I feel the benefits have been reduced, the services have been cut or monetized. This has created a tough environment for your employees to maintain good service. That being said, I was very impressed by the agent at the gate during boarding. Our flight was overbooked and my 8 year old son and I were seated in different rows. With no incentives to give to other passengers she found a way to get us seated together. Once aboard I was surprised to find that the flight did not include any type of in-flight entertainment, no screens and no audio. I gladly purchased it on the 5+ hr flight from EWR to PHX, but this was not even an option on the return. I was also surprised that there was NO safety demonstration given on the flight, which is definitely unsafe and possibly in violation of FAA rules.

 Luton to Heraklion. Well the flight and cabin crew are first class but the airline is let down by the ground handling agents it uses. Our flight out from Luton was boarded and pushed back from the stand and head down the taxi way towards the run way only to be met half way down by a follow me car from the airport and parked on a remote stand at Luton. This was after what I can describe has the worst aircraft marshalling I have seen since I watched a charity clip by the RAF on UTUBE. Luton Airport wonders why it is getting so many bad reviews and bad press. Why board an aircraft which you know is going to be subjected to a 30 minute delay. The aircraft captain told everyone that the was an ATC delay due to congestion en route but this would of been known before the aircraft was boarded so why board it? But when we did get underway the crew due to tail winds were able to make up the 30 minute delay and arrival on stand on time. The service on board was slick and professional. The menu was good value for money and we had pre ordered which is a new service and I can recommend this to any one. The return trip we left 35 minutes late due to the aircraft which was been used arriving late from its trip to Luton. However again the crew were able to make up 20 minutes of the flight time arriving into Luton 15 minutes late. But due to the non existent cowboy ground handling company and the jobs worth mentality of its staff who could only manage to be bothered to use one set of aircraft stairs for a full A320 which was parked on a remote stand meant we were kept waiting 35 minutes before we got into the terminal building.,Promoter

The flight was disgraceful, the cabin temp was hot and stuffy and even after multiple complaints by passengers the cabin crew did nothing about it. Service was slow, waiting over 30 minutes for someone to come was appalling, some passenger call lights were on the entire journey without ever being acknowledged. When the lunch service arrived the food was cold, the so called cold beverages were at room temperature. They ran out of ice 2 hours into the flight. The return flight GA-714 was an overnighter, we were kept at the gate for 20 minutes with no explanation. Being an overnighter most people wanted to sleep, for whatever reason they left the cabin lights on. For reasons beyond any comprehension they had a drinks service at 1am when most passengers were sleeping.",Detractor
LHR-JNB. From Check-in to baggage collection SAA service was flawless. Air stewards friendly food was as good as airline food can get (mediocre) but not worse than any of SAA's competitors.

NAP-BUD-NAP with a group of 12 people. Departure was on time gate staff rude and unprofessional at Budapest Ferihegy airport. They find any excuse to charge you for additional hand baggage. I was charged 60 Euros for a small piece of baggage I was obliged to pay cash as they were not ready to accept credit cards. 2 hours delayed departure on the second leg and uncomfortable old fashion non reclining seats.

As of 6:15pm no further announcements regarding our flight since the 3:55pm announcement. Meanwhile at the adjacent the gate there were debacles with the ability of staff to manage the security doors. This is all after they charge you for every bag - including carry on.

"  Newark to Ft Lauderdale. Spirit is unreliable and not necessarily the least expensive option. There are plenty of hidden costs. Since there is a high risk in losing a flight, this translates to hours of wasted time talking with customer service, which is really a useless outsourced buffer. Our flight was cancelled after 5 hr delay in April. We had expenses such as hotel, airport travel, car rental, so Spirit gave us a refund of the flights, along with 2 x $50 vouchers per person (We can't combine the vouchers on a single booking). Although this didn't cover all the expenses, I decided to let it pass. There were a few issues. Vouchers had to be used within 2 months to book two other trips per person (4 tickets in total). I couldn't find any destination for which Spirit was a better option than other airlines. And I was determined to fly to many destinations in order to use the vouchers. I inadvertently allowed vouchers to expire. I've been on hold with their customer service for 1.5 hours, to try and get them extended. They have me bouncing around like a ping pong ball. Everyone says I could've extend them if I called before expiration, which is a ridiculous rule.",Detractor

Travelled Sydney - London and return on QF1/2 in Premium Economy. Believe it was worth the sale price we obtained the tickets for but not the normal full price. The cabin service was excellent as we're the meals and entertainment system. The only downside of the trip was a late return into Sydney resulting in a missed connection. We were told we would be on the next flight but at domestic transfer we were told our domestic booking had not been changed and as there were no seats on the next flight we have to weight another hour for the flight after.,Promoter

"This was my first time to fly Domestic First Class on United Airlines. My first thoughts were how the cabin service reminded me of what economy class once was when I flew as a teenager in the late 1970's. This trip was from SEA to ORD to IND and back. Zone 1 boarding: Great! Initial cabin greeting was pleasant and prompt. Seat comfort good. Seat pitch a bit tight. Drink and snack service: very good. Flight Attendants: If I ran my own airline I would hire each attendant that I encountered on this trip. Meal service was good no complaints. Inflight entertainment: On the outbound trip there seemed to be a good selection that I could watch no charge on my own device. Connectivity needs to be simplified! On the return part of my trip the equipment was Inop. This is the second US carrier that I've encountered with Inop inflight equipment. United you need to spend more time making sure your equipment works. ""Just Good Enough"" is not good enough!",Promoter
"LGW to CMB via MLE and return Sept/Oct 2014. As a British Citizen you desperately want to like BA but they do make it very difficult to do so. The recent documentary ""A Very British Airline"" whetted our appetite that perhaps a commitment to service may have returned to BA particularly in the long-haul premium cabins. Sadly on all the legs the cabin service was totally indifferent without any effort to do more than the bare minimum. Attendants chewing gum no smiles everything was all too much effort. The only time the crew showed any animation was when talking to each other. Adequate is about the best description but it could have been so much better without any cost except a bit of effort.",Detractor

"4 flight sectors altogether: SIN-DOH-LHR on 5 May CDG-DOH-SIN on 21/22 May. SIN-DOH-SIN were on 787 DOH-LHR and CDG-DOH were on A380. A journey of contrasts between the excellent A380 and nightmare 787 which led to an average rating. For all 4 flights the in-flight entertainment were new advanced and top-notch though slightly laggy. USB ports were available for charging of equipment. The food was decent though the main meal servings were small. For snacks what they called sandwiches were actually (very oily) wraps with a small slice of cake. Service was also average (not as friendly as I'd expect though I must pity them because they sometimes had to deal with a tough crowd of fliers) and can be inconsistent across flights and even within a flight. For instance different kinds of snacks served sometimes a paper menu is used while other times it isn't. That said I appreciate the free amenity kit for the red-eye flights. The booking website was also a pain to use sometimes with outdated information or links that failed to work. New Doha airport which serves as QR's hub - looks new but unfortunately isn't customer-oriented. Now to the specific flight sectors / planes. The A380 is newer and very spacious with comfortable seat pitch and seat width. I will definitely fly their A380 again. The 787 ""Dreamliner however belies its ""dream"" qualities: I did not feel the narrower seat width until I had a man next to me poke his elbows into my ribs for hours while using a laptop on the DOH-SIN leg. I never felt this uncomfortable on a long-haul flight before. For the DOH-LHR leg I was ""upgraded"" to upper deck economy class due to a full flight and as I was a (rival) BA Avios member. Such seats are unavailable for normal reservation except for QR FFP members. That said I was a little unhappy with being ""upgraded"" to a seat without a window which I had originally reserved and requested. Overall I might fly QR again if the price and timing is right for in general they have performed above-average. Potential deterrent factors would include their 787 their buggy website and Doha airport (woe betide anyone with a long layover).",Passive

All flights on time all cabin crew polite attentive and thoroughly professional. Refreshments meals and drinks all appropriate for the flights and times of day. It was a pleasure to fly BA after 5 flights with AA. Just one small attitude problem with a ground agent at LHR while boarding for DXB. We were snapped at and told to wait while other passengers (presumably business class) boarded. We were not in the business class 'line' but just happened to be standing near one of the two gates where boarding passes were checked. The ground agent obviously thought that we were economy class passengers trying to board early. Overall a 99% satisfactory rating for these flights.

"  Houston to Amsterdam with United. Flight attendants were in a rush to serve dinner on this 8 hour flight. No smiles - just get it served and get it picked up. Since I spent 250,000 if my hard earned points to fly business on my first trip to Europe since 1986 I was anticipating a bit of a happier mood throughout the business cabin. Also, this was the vaunted new Polaris class which in my opinion was far from great. At 6'4"" I should have been able to stretch out flat, but because of the shape of the pods that could not happen. The seat was also very uncomfortable. This was some of the worst food I have ever been served on United. Thank goodness our flight back was on Air Canada which was a wonderful experience. Rest assured my new travel card will be Bank of America and where I not only earn more millage than with my current Chase card but also will not be stuck flying United again.",Detractor

"After a positive experience in economy recently I decided to fly them to China in business class due to a low fare plus the business class seat had looked very inviting when I walked past it on my previous flight. Indeed from LHR to CAI the seat was very nice although the service was very spotty just small things such as the cabin crew forgot to serve dessert to the last two rows of the cabin. Also if you serve a cup of tea with sachets of sugar perched on the saucer is it too much trouble to also include a teaspoon? I queued for ages for the forward lavatory before the milling flight attendants bothered to point out that there was also a lav aft. Basically an OK flight but with some weirdly amateurish omissions. Lounge in Cairo was a disgrace I spent most of the transit time crawling around on the floor of the ""business centre"" trying to get one / any of the computers to work (also wifi was broken). CAI to PEK was the long sector which I planned to make the most of the flat bed and sleep so imagine my disappointment to find that on this flight the seat was a much more old-fashioned ""Lazy Boy"" recliner and that after the doors closed the cabin crew upgraded all their friends which rather undermined the exclusivity of the cabin. Not worth paying for if crew use the business class cabin as a perk for their friends nor if the airline are deploying flat beds on short flights (LHR) and unsatisfying old seats on long flights (PEK). Had high hopes but totally disappointed by crew hard product and Cairo lounge. Not worth it.",Detractor
We flew LHR-Toronto outbound via Halifax and return via Montreal. Overall experience was positive with genuinely helpful and kind cabin crew on all legs decent IFE selection and all flights arriving on time even after one was delayed so they could find a bigger plane to accommodate a previous cancellation! All the connections were well managed too by calm and well organised staff. The LHR-Halifax flight is clearly not a prestige route and the older 767 along with some rather informal cabin crew and one bordering on 'doddery' did give the feel of something closer to a motorway diner than an international airline but we enjoyed it anyway. Where Air Canada does have big room for improvement is the food. Meals were given on both transatlantic flights but all were decidedly average with breakfast before landing at LHR a single piece of cake! Many have complained about the 3-4-3 seating layout on the new 777-300ERs and yes it is busy boarding and there are sometimes queues for the toilets but I'm 6'2 and even with my long legs it was manageable for 6 hours if not luxurious.

" Paris to Brisbane via Singapore. Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer.

"  Amsterdam to Casablanca. I flew with a group of fellow travellers from Amsterdam to Bamako in Mali with a stopover in Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc told half the group to receive their boarding passes for Bamako in Casablanca. They did not, because to aircraft was severely overbooked by returning Muslims from the pilgrimage to Mecca. With trepidation, I booked Amsterdam to Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. Without any notice, Royal Air Maroc cancelled my return flight and we were booked on an earlier flight. This made me put Royal Air Maroc on 24-hour death row watch with the help of from Amadeus. Amadeus informed me that my return flight was reschedules again. 49 hours before the flight I tried to get my boarding passes, but the web check-in was still closed. Exactly 48 hours before the flight I started the web check-in to print the boarding passes, finding out that only three seats were still available on this flight. All others were already allocated to other passengers before the web check-in even opened. My wife and I could not sit together. I called Royal Air Maroc but they confirmed this was not possible to be allocated a seat before the web check-in. Sure. At the airport check-in counter, I asked to sit together. The staff member asked her colleague to release seats with an ""R"" for us. Her reply: no. At the gate, we asked it again and promptly Royal Air Maroc gave us seats next to each other. On board the 737 we noticed about 20-30 seats empty. Very strange. We asked ourselves if there is any link between the departments of reservation and operation. The flight went well and the service was good. Amadeus informed us in time that our return flight would depart 1 hour earlier, due to the temporary Ramadan time zone shift. Royal Air Maroc did sent an email message, when we were in mid-flight. The flight was on time, the service was good and the meals tasted nice. Conclusion: in the last 60 years, Royal Air Maroc has learned to fly aircrafts very well. In the new departments of internet reservation & communication, Royal Air Maroc is still struggling as a newbie.",Detractor

Male attendant took out a book and sat almost immediately. The crew made faces when passengers spoke to them. Passengers asked about snacks and told they did not have any, however front staff were eating. Final straw was when they took out garbage bags and were making balloons with them and popping them.

They don't wait on people much outside of the organized mealtimes but it doesn't bother me to get up and fetch a drink as it's an opportunity to stretch my legs. Boarding at SFO was quick as there were several airbridges and we were boarded first. The problem came from the transfer at CDG. AF changed our flight to Nice because SFO-CDG was leaving later (due to delayed arrival) except they booked us on a flight out from Orly the other side of Paris. The check-in guy at SFO airport managed to change us to a flight out of CDG.

This was our first time using them. We went to Mazatlan Mexico from Jan 16/15 to Jan 23/15. I do not know if we had an exception to the rule but Sunwing was excellent. Great check-in people coming and going great flight staff and great on the ground people at the resort. A few things we did not like were: we used their Elite Plus service which was great to get a emergency exit but man the seats seemed hard. Maybe not used to flying as we only fly a few times a year sorry but Air Canada has a leg up on the seating department. You do get a free meal but it was really bad going down but an above average coming home. They only play one movie for the whole plane out of roof TV's I would rather have a seatback selection like the other airlines. Small thing but when stuck on a plane for 5 hours it's nice to have a selection. Would we use Sunwing again? For sure if going to the west side of Mexico.

" Vancouver to Edinburgh via London was the worst travel experience I have had. I was travelling with 2 seniors (+85 & +70) we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving. We actually had to beg for help. The distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors. In our way from London to Edinburgh it was a nightmare. The flight was delayed and we got to London about an hour late, on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no one seemed to care. The 2 seniors had to walk all that way. It was not only the walking, it was the rush they had, as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours. On our way back from Inverness to Canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance. Once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate. Again we had to beg for assistance and the British Airways staff did not seem to know or care about this. They said that they called the buggy and that was all. We said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no one seemed to care at all. We were lucky I asked a gentleman who was driving one of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 (in London) and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point. This gentleman who is not British Airways employee provided a great service. Summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance I asked and he decided to help us out. Seats were another problem. We did the online check in (24 before) and we had the seats already chosen 12D for one senior (isle) and 18D (isle) for the other senior. When we got to the counter in Inverness Airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats. Then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats. So once again, more walking for them, problems to get in/out the seats, and of course problem to get to the washroom. - luggage another problem! British Airways in Inverness said that the luggage goes directly to Victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in Vancouver. Surprise surprise! We went through customs and when we got to Westjet counter for the connection to Victoria they asked for the luggage. They said we had to pick it up before going through customs. There was no way to go back to the carousel, so we had to wait for the Westjet staff to contact somebody from British Airways to get us to the carrusel and take the luggage. So nightmare again!! And another rush to us to get to the next fligh. According to Westhet agents they said that British airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection. What can you expect from British Airways? If It doesn't even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance. We can only thank Westjet staff who provide the assistance in Vancouver.",Detractor
"  Bodrum to Istanbul.

Was first told that it was no problem, then the counter agent contacted her supervisor/colleague which first said that there was availability and that she could process my request but then strangely asked for my name, I could hear the whole conversation over the radio. I guess unless you are a local VIP your commercial value is of little importance. Then suddenly a barrage of invalid excuses followed. First she suggested that my fare class did not allow a last minute upgrade, when I pointed out that was untrue, it was unavailabllity bucket class C, which is also untrue according to M&S rules, finally she said there was a problem with their system, a TGS classic, I was handed out a seat in 6A and did not pursue the matter any further as a line began to form behind me. Not that of a big problem for a 50 minute flight but having had worse problems before, I was reminded once more how TK's ground services and customer service attitude on the ground, bar TK Do&Co, is a total mess. The flights to BJV and to IST were excellent in the air. On time, friendly and attentive cabin crew and detailed flight deck announcements. I wish it was good on the ground as it is in the air.",Passive

We flew into Australia from the US in the last month and took several flights with Qantas from SYD/BNE BNE/SYD SYD/MEL/HBA HBA/MELB/SYD and we were absolutely impressed with the entire service. Qantas has excellent lounges in BNE MEL and SYD. I had a barista in each lounge except HBA there was also an excellent selection of snacks light meals and premium wines. The flight attendants looked polished while maintaining that down-to-earth friendliness. They were able to accommodate my dietary requirements (vegan) on every flight with either a tasty snack or delicious meal even on those 1 hour flights between HBA/MEL. Admittedly we were sitting in business class so as to be expected the service was excellent.,Promoter

Had 3 flights to/from Gatwick - to/from Faro Larnaca Lanzarote over the past 3 months. The Faro flight was very uncomfortable as it was so hot and stuffy - and you cant escape it but after talking to a helpful person in Norway I was assured the other 2 flights would be properly air conditioned which they were. Always prefer airlines where you can adjust seats and that was the case re Lanzarote. The short films would be better if we had headphones and could listen too (or simply listen to music). The free wifi just about allows for emails to be received or sent but you need a well charged device to take full advantage of wifi (or provide a charging point). Slightly confusing in regards to 'flight mode' regulations as clearly it only works if your device is not in flight mode! This is the one airline however where the food and drink options are too limited and lack 'healthy' choices or good veg options - (Easyjet are best for food/drink). Unlike any of the other airlines we have to remember to bring own snacks etc. Finally no hassle with hand baggage which used to be a pre-flight concern with extra stress when flying with Ryanair or Thomas Cook. Easyjet has the best and clearest policy here 'if it fits it is free'!. One tip for all airlines - boarding should start with those seated at the back so front passengers do not hold up others when storing hand luggage. Ratings apply to last flight.,Promoter

And they are just trying to put both my cancelled flights as one so I don't get my money back! I have talked on the phone for hours and hours with these people.

"Paris CDG to Madrid with Vueling. Their app lets you check in but wonÂ´t issue any boarding pass. You still have to print the actual sheet with the scanning code. If you decide to check in in a time frame that Vueling considers too late (2 days before!) then you will only be able to do it at the airport as the app will not assign you any random seat but you will be forced to pay for seat assignment. How mean and stupid is that? Their seat space is the worst, even in their so-called emergency exits (15 Euros for the privilege of sitting on one of them!). Attendants are stressed, refreshments expensive (10 Euros for a sandwich and a coke) and they normally have run out of half of what is listed in the menu. TheyÂ´re not that cheap either.

It is almost laughable that AA is a part of Oneworld when the service standards of AA are not even close to its alliance partners. I flew LAX-NRT yesterday - disinterested and poorly-dressed cabin crew small and uninspired meals and an entertainment system that could have been considered to be state of the art in 1990.

"Phnom Penh to Los Angeles via Guangzhou. Was pleasantly surprised with the service, food and comfort of my flights on China Southern. The food was eatable, with one meal of beef particularly good. The service was decent, but the drink size was rather small. They did offer red and white wine, but the serving sizes were tiny. The inflight entertainment was not as good as compared to United Airlines intl flights, but was very respectable. The seats seemed bigger than United, and there seemed to be more room between seats. My biggest complaint with China Southern was the difficulty of getting my frequent flyer numbers attached to the flight. I did it when booking, but that seemed to disappear. I also did it I first flew to South East Asia, and that worked for my first two flights. But this data was lost yet again on my flights back and had to request mileage for those flights. If they could get small annoying things like this fixed, I would have rated the flights 8 or 9 out of 10.",Passive
 Accra to London via Lisbon. The worst experience ever. Do not be fooled with buying a cheaper ticket with TAP Portugal. No flight entertainment on both short and long term flights. They change travel to without informing passengers. Staff on the ground need training in customer service. Very robotic and some rude in mannerisms both Portugal and Ghana. On both journies there is only one person checking through security. Due to plane being far away from terminal and security you are bound to miss connecting flights if there is an hour apart. Ground staff appear not to be able to communicate together so the left not talking to right causing miss direction for travellers. You then get pushed from pillar to post and not given any options of your next connecting flight as stated in in their air passenger rights leaflet. Never again will I travel with them.,Detractor

 Auckland to Gold Coast. This is an excellent airline in the premium cabins. They are however woeful in economy on the trans-Tasman. As they only fly to the Gold Coast with narrow body aircraft there is no premium cabin and the best you can get is â€˜Works Deluxe'. We had expiring Airpoints so decided to use them for this product. There is nothing deluxe about the economy experience. The meal was disgusting and not fit for human consumption. Not that they care. They just clear it away as though it's nothing out of the ordinary that the food remains untouched. Beverages are served in tiny plastic cups that you can drink in two mouthfuls and you are continually requesting refills (complimentary alcohol on this fare class). The IFE is pitiful in content. Two crew members were obliging the others made you feel it was beneath them to lower themselves to serve you. Based on the flight I can see why this airline makes record profits - the inflight offerings are pathetic and would cost them very little. Unfortunately Kiwis are blindly loyal to this over rated airline and therefore they continue to get away with a sub standard product. Do not believe the hype on their website - it's mostly misleading garbage to make you think this is a glamorous airline.,Detractor
BA179 Jan 6 2015 LHR-JFK. First. T5 is great for the first class experience with check in security and straight into the Concorde room. The lounge and spa facilities are a great refuge while flying especially the dining room. The 777 has more room in the cabin than the 747 flight to London which I appreciated especially when it came to my bed. Seat 2A is private and roomy. It was a full flight so service was efficient and friendly if not a little rushed. Overall the service was at the great BA standard. What was lacking was the meal was lacking the freshness and taste which was disappointing. There was major (1hr) delay in planing at JFK which was not BA's fault but really made this flight much longer than it should had been.

I had the Lamb that was quite good they had Pepsi Max (I do prefer Coke Zero) good white wine the crew was always around looking that everything was fine covering your legs with the blanket and helping to put the sleepers before taking off.

"I'd heard the Spirit Airlines horror stories, but assumed my friends were being needlessly dramatic (they were not, as it turns out). I paid the fee for my carry-on online, and I do think they were rather transparent on that front. When the emails about flight delays started showing up around 10 AM, I knew I was in trouble. They continued throughout the day, with a final delay of nearly 4 hours. No one would tell us why there was a delay, and different passengers got different answers. I was told mechanical issues, and another passenger heard personnel complications. There was no monitor in the terminal, and the gates changed haphazardly and with no notice. If I had no been checking other gates out of paranoia, I never would have noticed the unannounced gate change. The seats were terrible",Detractor

We travelled Newcastle-Dublin-Chicago early October and chose Aer Lingus because of the option to do Immigration in Dublin. What a disappointment. At US Immigration in Dublin we were handed Customs Forms. The guy handing them out had no idea what they were for or who had to fill them in. The Immigration process however was fairly straightforward and much quicker than we've experienced in the US. Once on board what a disappointment. We waited almost two hours before the flight attendants came around with the drinks trolley. They only came around once in an eight hour flight. And we had to pay for the drinks. This is the first time we've had to do this on a Transatlantic flight. They never came around with complimentary water or juice. I asked the attendant for some water which she brought to me but when the lady in front asked for water she was told they'd stopped serving drinks!! Lunch was pretty grim and afternoon tea was a flapjack - pretty hard to swallow when you're thirsty! On a positive note when we landed in Chicago we collected our luggage and were on our way pretty quickly. The return overnight flight was no better then our flight from Dublin to Newcastle was delayed because of an incident in Dublin airport. We were sitting in a very cold aircraft for over an hour. The pilot said he would start the engines to warm the plane up - the propellors turned twice! When we got home I had a query and needed to speak to Customer Service.

Food wasn't anything exceptional though but I should mention that Singapore airlines does go through excessive lengths even in economy class, for instance providing menus.

Crew were varying. The ones that greeted us at the entrance were extremely pleasant but the ones in the rear economy class section were very serious and I saw barely any smiling.

Once on board I got settled in quickly and was really impressed with the extra legroom I got in Main Cabin Extra and some of the lockers are designated as reserved for these customers. The inflight food and beverage offering is the same as everyone else in Main Cabin. But I can't really grumble. I got a drink and a sweet biscuit within an hour of departure.

Amsterdam-Warsaw-Tbilisi 29 May 2014. Tbilisi-Warsaw-Amsterdam 1 June 2014. LOT offers very attractive fare on this route with pretty short connections in Warsaw. They operate new Embraer-195 aircraft which is very quiet and feel quite spacious despite of just 2+2 abreast seating leather seats with a comfortable pitch. The leg Tbilisi - Warsaw was however operated by one of their old 737-400 with very tight pitch and narrow seats. Flights were on- time most of the crew were friendly. The service is limited to serving water and a wafer bar free of charge the rest of food and beverages can be bought from their Sky bar. I bought a sandwich / coffee combination which was less than 4 euro I think it's very affordable. The short connection in Warsaw (I had 1 hr 10 min between the flights) can be tricky if you need to change flights from Schengen to non-Schengen zone. There was a bottle neck with long lines to passport control and security check at the Warsaw airport so I really had to run to catch my flight to Amsterdam.,Passive

"In reading through other reviews, I can see that my experience unfortunately is not unique. Customer service is lacking. This summer we took 8 flights with Turkish Airlines â€“ starting in LA and going to Istanbul, then traveling around the country also with Turkish Airlines, roundtrip to Denmark - and then back to LA. Quite a lot of time, money and interactions with the airline in June and July 2015. The initial trip was good, and we enjoyed the entertainment that helps make the 13 hours bearable. The food was not great. My request for vegetarian food was only honored on the trip to Istanbul. Lost luggage, rude interactions with Turkish Airlines staff at the check-in counter and onboard, zero accountability and initiative. Our luggage was lost 2 times during the 8 trips â€“ first with a connecting flight from Istanbul to Izmir. The plane was delayed from Kayseri so it wasn't a big surprise â€“ despite the fact the agent at the gate ensured us it was on the plane when we boarded. After1.5 hours the luggage appeared. And we got to our destination at 1 am in the morning. The second time â€“ on a direct flight from Copenhagen to Istanbul â€“ one suitcase was lost, remained lost for about 2-3 hours with no explanation â€“ and very little care from the staff at the lost and found office. After continued pressure they suddenly produced the suitcase, and we could get to our hotel. No explanation, no apology no care whatsoever. The following day we left for Los Angeles on our final trip back. We inquired, when checking in, if there was anything they could do to make our trip back a bit more comfortable due to the issues and time wasted earlier. In total we talked to six different staff members â€“ first to a supervisor in the check in area â€“ who said â€œnoâ€ and that was that. At the care Point â€“ the staff couldn't care less, the moment they were confronted with a problem, an unhappy customer, it appeared their command of the English language was lost, they gave us a blank stare and pointed to the gate. At the gate, we had the most unprofessional and rude encounter and staff said no. I was left with the impression that, no one cares, no one feels responsible and accountable, there's an acute lack of training and proficiency in the most basic part of customer care. If Turkish Airlines wants to deliver on the brand promise â€“ Europe's Best Airline, they need to embrace a better approach to service â€“ caring goes a long way when you are traveling, a smile, empathy and helpful interactions would have made a world of difference.",Detractor

Recently travelled AC Rouge to/from Cuba. This was a short flight of 3.5 hours. The seats were comfortable but not roomy. My husband and I left the arm rest between us in the upright position so did not feel as restricted. There is no on-board entertainment but I-Pads could be rented for $10.00. We had researched the airline and were aware of the lack of entertainment so we were prepare with our own - book cross stitch music crossword puzzles etc. The food provided (charged to your credit card) was fresh and tasty. The flight attendants were very young and needed a bit more experience in customer service. TIP - book your seat prior to flight and near the front section of the plane sometime run out of food choices by the time they get to the back part of the plane. Would not want to take AC Rouge on a much longer flight. There is not a lot of room between the seats and almost nil when the person in the seat in front of you reclines their seat.,Passive

"I do not mind flying Ryanair as long as it is much cheaper than the competition. Choosing your seat is cheaper than choosing a seat with British Airways. Plane seats are acceptable for short haul flying, the cleanliness could improve. Cabin crew do not bother you, but quick to react if you want something to eat. I ordered a 5 euro lasagne which was adequate for the flight. I avoid their drinks as they are overpriced so bring my own water. What ruins the Ryanair experience the most is flying into Stansted Airport. What a joke of an airport, it is enough to make me avoid flying Ryanair unless they are at least 30 Euros per leg cheaper. Any less than that, and I avoid flying them mainly due to the disgrace that is Stansted Airport.",Passive
"The new La Premiere First Class cabin offered by Air France is perfect. I liked the choice of colors and materials, it looks bright and relaxing, and the seat is very comfortable. About the food, there is not Champagne brands like Dom Perignon, but the food and beverages were delicious and well presented. It could be a bit more crazy or novel. But, the best experience was the bed with a great mattress. I generally never sleep for a long time in a plane, but the bed was large and comfortable. The idea of a curtain for privacy is simple but very efficient. So, indeed, my feedback is very positive regarding all these changes made by Air France. La Premiere product is really good.",Promoter
On March 2 2014 we flew back from Puerto Vallarta on Air Canada Rouge (flight A/C 1819). Was it a good experience? No. It was an awful experience. Rouge makes us see red. The seats in the plane were so crammed up that we felt that we were in a can of sardines One of us is 1 m 90 tall Consequently his knees were stuck in the seat in front of him with no way of stretching his legs. Many passengers with mobility issues had a hard time getting out of their seat (e.g: to go to the washroom). Rouge is a poor service and shame on Air Canada for offering it. It shows disrespect to the clientele. We'd rather pay more money to get a better service and have more space. We expect a better service.,Detractor
" Norwich to Rio de Janeiro via Amsterdam. I was recently charged Â£90 by KLM for just being 2kg overweight on one of my suitcases even though underweight on another? I have no issue with paying for excess baggage, but I feel the loyal customers are being ripped off at Â£45/kg!! The excess baggage fees are applied at the airport and do not appear on the KLM website. Beware of this dreadful scam!

TLV-SVO and SVO-RIX. TLV-SVO was on a new A330. As is typical of the former USSR the boarding announcement was met by a scrum of people rushing the boarding gate. No attempt made by the crew to regulate boarding and as a result it took nearly an hour. Once onboard the flight attendants were generally sour and the food was stale and lukewarm. In-flight entertainment was surprisingly good but still a step down from Delta and similar airlines. Despite TLV-SVO being an overnight flight the cabin lights were never dimmed and the service was staggered in a way that essentially prevented all sleeping. Could not figure this out. SVO was pleasant enough and SVO-RIX was an easy short-hop on a new 737. No service and no complaints. Would take Aeroflot again only if the price was significantly less than other European carriers.,Passive

" Detroit to Minneapolis. I've flown Spirit several times (at least 10 times in the last 3 years), each time mediocre at best but that's the standard Spirit reputation. As we all know or other reviews have said, there's no food, no drinks, the seats seem to get smaller each year, and the only bag you can have is a personal item (which also gets smaller each year). It's always cheap and rarely reliable but you get what you pay for because you get there eventually for a cheap price. I've never understood the people that say, wow I'm never flying Spirit again because you knew what you were signing up for. However, I've finally joined them. The last time I flew the flight was delayed by over 4 hours for no reason given which is nothing new but was a little inconvenient than previous instances. However, good ole spirit gave us a $50 voucher (nice, right?) and I rearranged my schedule. Before we all get too excited let's not forget this is Spirit. The voucher expires in 60 days (reasonable) but you can only use it for the base flight payment (don't forget to read the small print) and there is no way to use less than the voucher amount on the flight. So an exciting voucher that made me think - wow, I've been delayed so many times with Spirit without receiving a voucher but now that I have a voucher, I'll definitely keep flying with them! Turned into wow, Spirit you win again. Long story short, they price their base flight fee right below the voucher amounts to make them irredeemable. No amount of discussion with their phone ""help line"" aka computer that routes you to a person after 10+ minutes of trying to enunciate numbers into a phone will allow you to consent to losing the majority of the voucher if you can just use $5 to $10 of it.",Detractor

IST-BKK a flight we were looking forward to but which disappointed. Our domestic connection was very late but we were given no help at all at Ataturk to transfer to the international terminal in fact an airport staff member tried to prevent us taking the fast route through. The Bangkok flight was listed as only 10 minutes behind schedule so we did not get to the reportedly wonderful lounge but stood in line to board and waited and waited. Flight eventually took off nearly two hours late. Priority boarding OK and a very helpful ground staff who checked that our baggage had been safely transferred. Clean and comfortable Business cabin A330 300 with flat beds and 2x2x2 configuration. Full cabin tiny loos. We sat at the gate for more than an hour with no explanation or apology from the flight deck and took off just before 10pm. Cold drinks before take off champagne after take off dry tepid towel offered. The meal was good but not fantastic and each course took so long to come. Not to use trolleys in a full cabin may look good but slows things down so much. No proper wine glasses we were given our second requested glass of champagne in a large water tumbler! This lack of style and training was obvious at all times. FAs were friendly and obliging but not confident or capable as on many other premium airlines. One had so little English she could not understand us or we her. Good choice of entertainment but the amenities bag was awful. Posh bag very little inside no face cream and the slippers had been used and recycled. Poor storage and FAs had no idea what to do with pillows and duvets once passenger luggage was in the racks. Completed breakfast orders were not collected but we handed ours over. The hot part of breakfast was worse than any premium cabin we've flown in: flabby white toast inedible unseasoned eggs. No announcement from the flight deck about our lateness of arrival or apology/explanation of why. No local time check either and when we asked a FA he got it wrong by an hour!

My wife and I flew from SEATAC to Midway near Chicago with a stop in Denver. This was round-trip so there were four flights in all. Not one flight left on time. You would think the law of probably would ensure that at least one flight would be on schedule but that was not so. We flew classic plus so we had one free checked bag one free carry-on and a free drink during the flight. I feel sorry for those that had to pay for those things. When did we have to start paying extra for customer service? Since you have to pay extra for everything everybody tries to make all their luggage carry-on. This slowed down the boarding process and only made the whole experience worse. Everything but the seat you were sitting in was extra and it seems that if federal guidelines would allow them to pack more people onto a plane by doing away with the seats they would do that too! The flight attendants were courteous to your face but since we sat in the front right next to them we could overhear them talking about passengers in the back and previous passengers on other flights. Very unprofessional. I would not recommend this airline to anyone expecting a decent experience. If you don't mind being treated like you are cattle being led to slaughter then this airline is for you. I wouldn't fly Frontier again no matter how low the fare is.,Detractor

" Dublin to Rome Ciampino with Ryanair on 2 non priority tickets. We had bought 2 seats across an aisle together as they were 2.50 each and actually the plane had plenty of empty seats so we ended up sitting together. Had they been dearer I wouldn't have bought the seats and instead more than likely sat at opposite ends of the plane due to that crazy seating algorithm that needs to go! Boarding at Dublin swift and efficient and staff were very nice and courteous on outbound flight. On time arrival into CIA. Due to not having priority boarding our bags were taken off us at the aircraft and we weren't waiting long for them at the terminal. On the way back, a similar pattern, really nice staff on board, highly efficient and pleasant. Interestingly they turned off the cabin lights and toned down the service after about an hour which was really welcome. I have to say the constant selling is tiresome but on this flights the hour and half with dimmed lighted was very pleasant and appreciated by all passengers. Small delay on take off as wind was 15 knots which was too strong under Italian aviation law but we were well updated by flight deck. More notifications as we flew right over Paris and over Heathrow I wouldn't have any problems flying Ryanair again but play by the rules. If you want an allocated seat and carry on luggage take a priority ticket.

"  Semi-frequent flyer of Cathay Pacific, so not surprised service was as on par as usual. Red-eye flight between Hong Kong and New York Kennedy with a stopover in Vancouver. Transit passengers from HKG boarded prior to passengers departing from YVR through a gate with partition in between. Boarding for YVR-originating passengers was a bit hectic, and gate agents were running around trying to get priority boarding completed before general boarding began. I was granted priority boarding, thanks to the benefits of their frequent flyer program. I was greeted with enthusiasm and warmth by the purser, a great way to start a trip. Business Class was very empty, Premium Economy was almost full, and Economy was 80% full (a lot of the middle seats were empty). Personally, I felt like the crew were able to provide a more comfortable service, as there was no hassle to get through the meal service. Choice of food were either rice with chicken in a black bean sauce, or braised beef with mashed potatoes. I went with the rice option, and needless to say, it was one of the best meals I've ever had on CX. Flight departed YVR and landed in JFK ahead of schedule.

However on the way back I was directed to the kiosk checking only and I got annoyed because I wanted to check in with a person so we could change our seats. They refused and said I had to use the kiosk no exceptions. They said I had to go upstairs after security at the actual gate. So I went up there and asked them to arrange the seats so each parent could sit with a kid but they said the flight was full and they could not change seats.

"  Firstly, Sunwing does not state any hidden costs involved when you arrive or depart the airport. When we arrived to Punta Cana, we had to pay $10 USD as their arrival tax. When you leave, you must pay a $20 USD departure tax before you can check in. We read online about this tax and usually other airlines would incorporate it into their flight or bigger airlines might just waive this for customers. If this tax is not paid, you cannot enter the airport or get checked into your plane. Secondly, there were long line up's to check in - it took us 90 minutes standing in line. There is no online kiosk available and even if you check in online, you still need to line up to drop off your baggage. Sunwing partners with DR's tourism company Nexus - which they arranged for shuttle buses to drop you off and pick you up - which is a plus. However, there is poor planning and scheduling. They drop off all the passengers on a plane at the same time - hence causing the 90 minute wait. (We were the only airline that had a long line up for the 90 minutes we were at the airport and we were there 2pm not the middle of the night). Not to mention - there were only two clerks serving customers checking in. Lastly, there was a long delay coming back home - what would have been a 7 hour flight became 11 hours. We needed to make a fuel stop from Punta Cana to Hamiliton, Ontario because they stated that they need to change crew and also get fuel and refresh their supplies. This is a huge inconvenience to the customer as we are left like prisoners stuck on the plane waiting for them to change crews. It is definitely not necessary to have a fuel stop as we flew from Vancouver to Punta Cana direct flight. So the only reason they did a fuel stop was because the flight attendants timed out and they needed to change crew. This caused a different and much longer flight route and delayed us. This was very poor planning and scheduling on Sunwing's part. This was the worst flying experience I've ever had. Do not choose SunWing.",Detractor

Worst part was the cabin crew, they only smiled when passengers were getting off from aircraft as if they waiting for that to happen. I have traveled with Air India on domestic sectors earlier and the crew was far better. Nevertheless, the overall experience was good. Reasonable price, comfortable aircraft, food was OK, not much choices in beverages.",Passive
"  Minneapolis to Guangzhou via Detroit and Beijing, returning from Beijing via Detroit. Departing flight was fine, Delta spend a few more bucks for better food, refreshments, and bottled water was generously given out. This made a 13 hour flight more pleasant. The downside was the arrival at Guangzhou on a China Southern Airlines domestic flight, had to depart plane only to get herded into a stand up bus, then to door to get luggage. It was hot, and after a 26 hour flight time makes one grumpy. Return was fair, food was fair. Real downside was a delayed departure from Beijing to Detroit and then boarding the plane in Detroit to Minneapolis to be treated rudely by attendant for being late after I practically ran from getting my luggage to go through customs then to the boarding gate. The late departure was Delta's fault, faulty equipment. Several times I have witnessed passengers treated this way going to Minneapolis on the night flight.",Detractor
" Bangkok to Dar es Salaam via Addis Ababa on B787-8 aircraft. Bought a promotional ticket and enjoyed all the privileges fully. This airline suits me well and is excellent when there are no logistic problems. Checked in on-line with some difficulties â€“ had to reload the pages several times. Printed BPs accepted throughout though the airport and replaced by â€œoriginalsâ€ at the gate. Flights on time. Miracle Lounge in BKK opposite their departure gate D4 is very nice, had a shower. Cabin 2-2-2 configuration in business slightly cramped â€“ they gave me two seats so I felt comfortable. Food and drink offering onboard was good and exotic. Given dinner (3 choices) at around 2:30 a.m. and again breakfast before landing despite the flight lasts only 7Â½ hour. FAs are kind but much less professional than for Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines. Special meal accommodated. IFE excellent. The airport in Addis needs expansion and tends to be very crowded and messy. Lounges in Addis were full, though with good food and Wi-Fi. Smokers area like a pig-stall. Gate for second flight changed 3 times, including flight number. Poor signage and information at most gates made frustrated and panicking passengers. Nice airline, deserve roughly their SKYTRAX 4 stars but no more. However, we are very far from getting the 5th compared to downgrade to the 3rd.",Promoter
" DÃ¼sseldorf to Bangkok via Abu Dhabi. I will not use this airline again. I don't recommend Etihad and will personally stay away. They charge up to 30â‚¬ for your online check-in, because they charge you for the seats you choose. This is not acceptable. For the first flight, it was mandatory for me to show my payment card at the counter, so online check-in was off the table anyway. It's probably some law or security measure, but inconvenient nonetheless. In addition, Etihad has sent me at least 20 Spam E-Mails. I want to know which genius in this company thought it would be a great idea and a sure way to convince people to upgrade to Business class, if you spam their E-Mail Account. Just stop sending E-Mails. Flights were alright, second leg was delayed by 3hrs and I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted. They ran out of beer on the second leg, too. Not that it matters that much, but a little inconvenient. I am tall, and legspace is a big issue. Seats with more legroom (i.e. emergency exit) cost about 130â‚¬ (for my booking class). Anyhow, seats are very uncomfortable, because of the back pocket in the seat in front of you. It is huge, it is sharp, it is right where my knee caps are and stuffed full of unnecessary advertisements and other stuff that no one needs. Food was good.",Detractor

YVR-TPE-BKK return. Outbound leg on March 30th and inbound on May 10th. Our YVR-TPE leg was delayed by an hour or so due to avionics failure on the B747. The captain and crew were very professional about it kept us informed of the reasons and troubleshooting progress as we waited on the tarmac. Other than that flight was very great for this leg and all other outbound and inbound legs. I found their cabin crew extremely professional courteous safety-oriented and well groomed. Inside the cabin the planes were clean and fresh. I had ordered Moslem Meal and to my delight the meals were very good quality on all flight segments. I wish they had used Airbus jets as I am not a fan of the 3-4-3 or 3-3-3 configurations (prefer to sit 2-4-2 on the side having two seats). EVA falls short on one thing - IFE. Their music collection can be vastly improved and widened. My first time with EVA and certainly won't be the last.,Passive
"Los Angeles to Guangzhou, and for the past three years I'd been increasingly flying China Southern, partly because of the prices and offers (majority of those flights were personal) in comparison with other airlines, and it offered direct link between London and Guangzhou when I was living in London before moving to Los Angeles. I used to fly quite a bit of domestic flights with them but they didn't impress much. I would still be picky about their food and beverage choices as some were far from authentic or delicious, and a poor selection of wines. Most staff did their job but some seemed over enthusiastic and this sometimes can be a bit annoyed. In general they are nice and helpful. In this price I couldn't have asked more but without those offers and say if I need to pay the full price I would say they have a way to go.",Passive

BKK-HKG on a busy Saturday afternoon in July on an ageing A330-300. The plane looked and felt old and the shell- type seats are not my favourites - but on a full flight they guaranteed a little more privacy and leg room.

Moreover the white wine they serve on their short flights is awful and always warm. A very hectic and chaotic experience with a very hard-working staff.,Passive
MAN-AUH-BKK. 777-300. Reasonable priced flights no issues with delays or with change over at AUH. Food volume and quality was acceptable as was the IFE. However the seating was very poor we were in a row of 3 as a family and could not get comfortable. The seats had the wrong profile were too hard and too narrow and the leg room was shocking. Travel to Thailand and the US regularly and of all the airlines we have used these seats are by far the worst. Even Ryanair has better seat and we all now how much they like to cut costs. It would put me off travelling with them again however the key factor for us is price.,Passive
I travelled business class SQ218 from Melbourne to Cebu flight was great and comfortable. Had the new pod seats. Upon my return travelling home to Melbourne SQ237 was disappointing. The Business seats were tiny old and seat was at a very uncomfortable angle. A couple of hours into the flight my back was aching. I've flown a few times business class with this airline but this would have been the worst I have experienced. I think it's time the old planes are upgraded and the seats are refurbished. For the money we pay I think all passengers deserve a comfortable trip.,Detractor
Travelled with United on 6 flights from 23/05/2014-08/06/2014 Heathrow to Las Vegas to Hawaii and back. On the 6 flights we were only fed two meals from Heathrow to Houston and Washington to Heathrow. We queried this with the customer services and were told in Washington that they do supply food on interior (domestic) flights shame we were not informed of this before we flew with them. We changed our flight from Newark New York when we arrived at Heathrow at the start of our holiday because they asked us if we would obviously New York was overbooked which resulted in us missing our connection to Las Vegas. They were unhelpful at Houston and put us on Standby. We thought the cabin crew were scruffy unhelpful and lazy. I asked for a small bottle of water to be told that they did not have enough so could not give me one. They did serve enough drinks on the flights so what were they doing. I will never fly with them again.,Passive

17 September Bucharest - Krakow with a stop in Warsaw. The plane left 40 minutes late from Bucharest causing us to miss the connection to Krakow. In Chopin airport LOT personnel had no idea what to do. We had to wait 3-hours until to the next flight - the service on the planes are similar to a low cost airline. They offer a glass of water and chocolate. The plane to Krakow had a delay of 35 minutes so we reached Krakow around 1am instead of 9pm. Return 26 September 2014 the same scenario repeated. The plane from Krakow to Warsaw had 35 minutes delay announced at the time of the boarding. We had only 40 minutes stop in Warsaw. Luckily for us we weren't the only passengers missing that flight since they had other passengers coming from Gdansk and other cities with LOT with delays. LOT connection to Bucharest waited for all these passengers. I will never fly with this company again and I would never recommend to anyone. Better fly with low cost and at least you know what to expect: bad services no food delays noisy and old airplanes.

HKG-Bali-HKG in Economy class on 777 (old shell seats). Flight time from HK to Bali changed twice prior to departure from 10.30am to 22.40hrs the evening before. Flight out only about 100 people on board so had plenty of room to spread out return flight full. Crew very attentive on both legs meal good and entertainment excellent Only complaint is the 'Shell Seats' I know Cathay are phasing these out and I can understand why these are not comfortable in the slightest and this flight was only 4.5hrs so I would dread to think what it would be like on a Long haul flight. Legroom for Economy was actually quite good at 6ft 1in I had no problems evening when I reclined the seat (which slides forward to the seat in front).,Passive

Unfortunately due to a problem with my reservation which I made through BA check in took a long time but was eventually sorted out by the very Cathay Pacific agent at HK central. Due to the delay I had to proceed straight to the gate once I reached HKIA. Boarding was done quickly the aircraft a Boeing 777-300er was spotless, was shown to my seat 1A with drinks and amenities provided. The seat is fantastic with lots of floor and storage space. Meal options/orders taken prior to departure departed on time and once airborne service started quickly. The food and service provided was first class, the crew very experienced chatty and available. I managed to sleep for 4 or 5 hours during the flight using the flat bed seat and a very comfortable duvet. When I was awake I used the Inflight entertainment system which was clear and offered lots of variety. Crew provided snacks and drinks throughout the 12h 20min flight, dinner was offered about 2 hrs out of London and again service and food was extremely good. Flight arrived around 15 min late due to airport delays but once off, bags were waiting and I was out of T3 within 20 mins. The service provided by Cathay Pacific Airways have really opened my eyes to the the service experienced by the airlines I normally use.

Finally, it took 46 hours in total to reach Amsterdam (includes delay, overnight stay, flights in transit) from Auckland. Better communication to stranded passengers would have resulted in an ideal outcome as we were unsure as to how long we would be stranded in Bangkok and the location of our luggage. In saying that, the Thai Airways staff on the plane were friendly, food was fantastic, and the ample refreshments were great. We enjoyed the flight service better than the ground service.",Passive

Since the plane was not full, I asked if it is possible to relocate my seat, because I would like to sit next to my spouse.

On a scheduled return flight from our vacation Sunwing's representatives never contacted us at the hotel to inform us that our flight was delayed. Their online site stated that the flight was on-time. When we arrived at the airport we waited for 3 hours to be told that they would not let us check in and no one was there. It wasn't until 17 hours later that our flight arrived. Horrible communication! No communication! Other passengers were informed to some degree but 30 of us were not. Would never fly Sunwing again or recommend airline to anyone.,Detractor
"I travel frequently with Ryanair mostly because its destinations and schedules are convenient. The airport teams are efficient to the point of being distant/abrupt while the flight teams are busying and friendly. Altogether I find Ryanair best of the low-budgets. However its constant and repetitious announcements inflight could really improve. On Stansted-Karlsruhe there were 11 announcements before take-off and 11 during the one-hour flight (22 announcements within 75 mins!). The content covered safety refreshments and fund-raising. On 5 of these occasions when the announcement was the first time announced it began ""Once again...."" on 7 occasions the completely unnecessary request was to ""sit back relax and enjoy the flight"". Am I the only person who finds this really irritating?",Passive

At boarding time we were notified there would be a 30 minute delay because there was no first officer. Then there was a delay until 7 am. That was followed with delays until 8, 9 and 10 am. finally, they notified us that the flight was cancelled and that we should go down to their rebooking line. (The fact that they even have a re-booking line should have been a warning). The line was several hours long. By the time I reached the agent the soonest they said that they could re-book us was 2:45 pm the next day. They were not even going to provide a hotel or food vouchers until we complained because we live only 50 miles from the airport. The customer service we received was the worst that I have experienced. They kept us in the dark the entire time as to what really was going on. While sitting in the airport I could see on the departure board that several spirit flights had been cancelled. I will never use this airline again.",Detractor
Amsterdam to San Francisco in a B747-400. Check-in was quick and easy the waiting was not so long due the amazing airport. The waiting time at the gate was not long. When we had boarded and found our seat we had a small delay due to seating problems. In the air we got beverages and delicious food. The personal entertainment system did not have amazing movies but that was because there weren't good movies that time of year. A good detail was that you could not look at the screen from the person sitting next to you. After a small amount of time they where handing out warm meals. I chose chicken with a beverage of my choice and after they collected my empty tray I got a bucket of vanilla ice cream.

" Las Vegas to Chicago via Milwaukee. Our airline was late due to a flight attendant being late to board the plane, the flight was delayed a total of 3 times putting us approx. 45 minutes behind. We did make up some significant time on our duration and got off the plane with about 20 minutes to spare, we ran across the airport to our gate where we learned that they gave our seats away due to us. It being there, the funny thing was they also informed us that they oversold our flight and gave our seats to those people.

"  Denver to Quito via Dallas/Ft. Worth. So we planned an awesome trip to the Galapagos and made the mistake of purchasing plane tickets to Quito Ecuador on American Airlines. I made the horrible mistake of screwing the time up and arriving at the Denver airport with only 45 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave. When we got to the ticket counter the American Airlines (AA) ticket agent told us that they closed acceptance for luggage 5 minutes ago, so they don't let us on our flight because of 5 minutes! This is where we really got shafted because we asked them to find us another flight to get to Quito and they did, but they gouged us for an extra $2500, which was $1500 more than the original cost of the tickets, we were furious, but with all the other reservations and time taken off work what could we do but let them take advantage of us, so we paid. The ironic rub to that flying out experience was the return flight from Quito, which AA delayed over 3 hours and only gave the excuse that it was ""legal"" issues. When I complained to them in an email they admitted that they didn't plan well enough in this computer age for a flight that had been scheduled for months to be able to have pilots that were rested enough to make that flight according to the FAA, so they held the flight until the pilots were legally rested. So this corporate giant wouldn't hold our outgoing flight 5 minutes so they could load our luggage, but they didn't mind messing up every passengers connecting flights on our return flight because of their own lazy planning. I'm never flying on AA again and if you can avoid it you shouldn't either.",Detractor
"  When I lived in Hong Kong, Cathay was my favorite airline. The quality of meals and service have not advanced as far, this year, as Emirates, Etihad, and Turkish â€” the airlines I have most used of late. But my biggest gripe with Cathay is with their customer service. I flew home to the US to care for ailing relatives. I had bought a very economical economy seat and I knew the ticket was non-refundable and that there would be a fee should I have to extend my stay but the $650 Cathay wanted in order for me to change my return flight by one week was more than I paid for half my round-trip ticket. I told their phone rep the family's medical reasons I needed to stay, but it made no difference. When I suggested that I might as well look for a one-way flight cheaper than Cathay's change fee, she said only that I should call them if I wasn't going to use my ticket. ""Why?"" I inquired. ""There's no refund, right."" She replied that no, there was no refund, but that that would be the polite thing to do. Cathay Pacific has not been very polite to me. Never again, Cathay.",Detractor
"First time on FR in 6 years, as FR only option non stop MAN-STR. FR do ssem to be trying to improve both their onboard image and website functionality. Booking process easier, booked seats on return but not outbound as limited online access travelling on alpine holiday. Booked 1 hold bag and away we went. Check in easy at MAN, no hassles over cabin bag sizes and the hassles and stress seemed more passenger driven than airline provoked. Didn't join the queue 60 minutes early at the gate, not only were we assigned seats together, we also got overhead room easily as well. Flights a bit late but that's European air travel. Crew fine and we were in the STR rental car building in 25 minutes on arrival.

" San Francisco to Atlanta. Coming from SFO, I had a layover in Atlanta before arriving in Burlington. My flight was scheduled to land at 10:20pm but we did not get to the plane until close to 11pm. After getting off the plane, I waited for awhile and I did not see my luggage. By the time my luggage was located at the service desk, it was already 12am and I was told that my luggage did not get delivered and was still in Atlanta. It was freezing cold in Vermont, I did not have my luggage or any change of clothes. I had work in the morning and was notified that my luggage would arrive by 10am. My luggage did not get delivered to my hotel until 5pm the next day, which surpassed the 6hour. The company did not compensate my loss with anything. No extra miles, ride to my hotel, or anything to help me get through the freezing cold weather. By the time I found news of my luggage, everything was closed already.

They ask me to pay a full price one way ticket at $800, instead of the $102 it was supposed to cost. I sent a letter after the trip and ask explanation and reimbursement. They replied after 1.5 month. They said they made a mistake with the code share partner and apologised, but they didn't reimburse the difference between what I was suppose to pay and what I paid without having any choice at the airport. In short they made a mistake but don't take responsibility. I have stopped using this airline.

"  Gatwick to Krakow. I usually had no issues with EasyJet, as a single person you can deal with no thrill on short flights. However, now as a parent my needs and requirements have changed and i do not think Easyjet takes care of this customer base at all. On a bright side - staff was nice and at points very helpful. However my stroller was not delivered to the aircraft at my destination - not an airport restriction as even Ryanair does this - I had to wait for my stroller more than people for their luggage (not easy with active toddler) - on the way back in Gatwick again I did not get the stroller and when I asked if it will be at the top of the sleeve was told it will not be available until baggage claim. That is a very long walk carring a toddler and waiting for passport control. I was told that 'maybe' i can find a yellow pushchair that i guess are used to lower the cost of service. None was available to anyone on this flight - not only me. If easyJet wants to use this system than i should have an option to prebook this chair or have enough available for all. Otherwise they cant claim they provide the service. - at the end again I had to wait until most of the luggage rolled off I fly a lot with my toddler - low cost and not - but never before I have had to endure this inconvenience. It may not be a problem with older kids but with toddler it really makes a 2 hour already challenging journey terrible.",Detractor

Also one of the restrooms is broken and you can't use it, so there was always long line to use the restrooms. Don't expect too much about the food. Once landed I could't help myself grabbing my belongings and rushed as fast as I can out of this disaster place.

When we presented for check in 2 hours prior to departure the lady told us the flight was overbooked and unfortunately we won't make it she was not able to give us any other information. After a 30 minute discussion a manager came to us and we must admit he was quite efficient.

Toronto-Helsinki-Milan return. Starting off with my flights to and from Milan they were fine. Went off without a hitch. Service was fine no complaints but I did find the one skimpy little sandwich they fed you for that 2.5 hr flight was pretty mediocre. My flights from and back to Toronto were another story though. It wasn't the service that got me but the type of airplane they used (a Boeing 757). The 757's are meant for short to medium-haul flights so why they use it for a long-haul 8.5hr flight is beyond me. It had next to no entertainment leg room seat width or seat recline. It was like being a sardine. So my advice: for European domestic Finnair is perfectly fine. For specifically Toronto-Helsinki though don't fly Finnair unless they change the aircraft used. You would be far better off flying indirect with another airline.,Passive

"  Melbourne to Las Vegas via Los Angeles. All things considered, United offer a good business class service for this long-haul flight. Plane left on time and food served promptly after departure. Food quality was fairly good. Movies and IFE were also good. Service was prompt and attentive. Seat reclines flat and allows you to get a good sleep. In terms of full-blown, memorable personalised service, it probably is a little below the level of other airlines. Also, there's some cost cutting aspects which became apparent after a while. I asked for another bowl of nuts some way into the flight and was told ""We're out of nuts."" I asked for a snack and was told that they put out sandwiches and snacks, but only at the half-way point of the journey. So it seemed that they have some limitations, presumably to ensure that the cost per passenger per flight doesn't exceed a certain amount. The seats were good an modern. Possibly not as overly comfortable as some other airlines, though I slept very well on the way back. Wifi was good, when it worked! I have to say that I was generally happy overall.

Upon arrival in San Francisco I learned that was not the case. I was told we had to wait a few hours and was going to Houston where I would be connected to Baltimore. We arrived in Houston and was greeted by another rude employee telling us the delay caused us to miss the connector to Baltimore and would get us a later flight putting us in Baltimore around 10pm and that was our only option.

This smacked a bit of low-cost airlines, but I guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double-decker plane. The first cabin on the A380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space. The dividers seemed higher, too, giving better privacy. The fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus. Cabin crew were friendly, attentive and thoroughly professional. Food was good, too, and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly.

" Los Angeles to Baltimore. I travel a lot and this was by far the worst airline I have ever been on. As a first time spirit airline traveler, I wasn't aware that you would have to pay for a carry-on bag. At the ticket counter, the attendant clearly saw my carry-on but said that everything was okay.

When I asked what my alternatives were, she said I could wait and fly in two days and pay for the carry-on at the ticket counter or not take my bag with me. In addition to that, the flight was overbooked causing delays as they forced an elderly woman off the flight to give the seat to someone else. I will never fly with spirit airlines again and will tell all my family and friends not to fly with this airline either.

"  Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option. Emirates is very much a last option for myself now.",Detractor

Attempts by staff to re-boot the system failed so I had to cope with two 12-hour flights with no entertainment. On the flight out my table was broken. When I raised this with the crew, I was told that a previous passenger must have ""bounced a child on it."" Dinner was very good but breakfast was appalling. There was only congealed egg and bacon. When asked if I could have a Continental equivalent, all I got was a stodgy choc chip muffin and some fruit juice. The plane looked generally tired. We had to share one inflight magazine between us. The pillows and blankets were a very uninviting brown colour. My partner's entertainment system did work but she did have to get a stewardess to use a spoon to release the handset from its position in her seat. I certainly wouldn't pay BA's rate for Premium Economy again.",Detractor

Flew QR on 3 Feb to Cape Town. The Dreamliner was most disappointing. Noisy Cabin. Narrow seats no leg room. And if you are above 5'10 you will struggle to squeeze in. Food portions were very small plastic fork and spoons mediocre and slow service. On a 8+ hour flight only served drinks once. Flights on all sectors were on time. Ran out of non-veg food on two sectors. Crew seemed amateur and clumsy. Except on the Jo'burg-Doha sector which was a daytime flight where the crew were cheerful and friendly they were grumpy on all other sectors. In between meals snacks were just a small packet of chips or chocolate. Snack with drinks only given on the Jo'burg-Doha sector were tasteless small bread sticks with a horrible salsa. Nuts would have been a 100 times better. Old hindi movies and very limited choice on TV channels. Never again on QR.,Detractor
"Liverpool to Berlin. We booked to go to Berlin outgoing on 29th of October and all went well till the departure gate when we were told one item of hand luggage was over sized and we would have to pay extra for it to go in the hold and the price would be Â£45. We elected to pay with a card which didn't please the female staff member as she didn't have a card reader and with my wifes card on display for all to see she wrote out a receipt giving every passenger in close proximity a clear view of the numbers. When my wife objected to this it was made clear to her that this was frowned upon and we could be banned from the flight. For our return on 1st November the staff in Berlin were totally different and my own bag was put in the hold free of charge to free up cabin space. On checking I have found that along with others easyJet changed their policy on hand luggage a while back and while I accept we were wrong, the company and it's employees ignorant attitude and primitive methods leave a very bad taste and we will not go with them again.",Detractor
" Amsterdam to Ankara via Istanbul. Turkish Airlines is a difficult airline to review with varying ups and downs. Business cabin is pretty good with comfortable seating but without an all-aisle access layout that misses window seats for this. IFE screen size and selection is very good but there was a problem with my system which had to be rebooted for 3 times and I could only start a movie near the end of the flight, and I could not finish of course. Although not perfect, cabin service is good, but ground service is undeniably terrible. I barely could catch my transit flight after a very long, chaotic and totally unassisted sweaty rush from one side of Ataturk Airport to the other. Many airlines, mostly from Asia, set the bar to a very high level recently which clearly pushes Turkish into a way lower tier for such treats. I would not pay a dime extra for Business and straightly prefer Economy class with this airlines, especially for short and mid hauls.",Passive

Flew from JFK in New York to Madrid. The 10.05 pm flight took off at 2.20 am. Flew from Barcelona to Madrid. The 12.05 pm flight took off at 4 pm and fortunately the 5.35 flight from Madrid to JFK was also about an hour late so we didn't miss our connection. Needless to say the experience was terrible and the on ground support was poor. Nobody could explain the delays or even when the plane would be ready to take off. The messages posted about departures never change so that regardless when the flight boarded and was scheduled to depart only the original information appeared. In addition our dietary requests - made far enough in advance were ignored on the flight to Spain but honored on the return trip.,Detractor

Seat is usual economy seat, it's a joke they sell this product as business class. No entertainment and a disgraceful meal on business class. Service was very fast. Overall experience in this flight was no any better than economy class - it's a complete joke they call this product ""business class"" - you just waste your money.",Detractor
"  Sofia to Brussels with Wizz Air. Without a doubt one of the sneakiest airlines out there. Very unclear baggage allowances and whenever your bag is even a few centimeters too long they immediately smack you with a very high 'fine'. They are either not interested in creating clear guidelines or live off of the fines they hand out every flight. I had to search for half an hour on their website before I found out exactly how to make sure I would not have problems at the boarding, but I saw several passengers being sent back to pay more. Boarding crew was condescending and sneered answers instead of replying normally. Flight crew was lazy and appart from the fake smile at the entrance not friendly either. Definitely never flying with them again, horrible airline.",Detractor
" We bought return tickets for 2 seats. The idea was that each of our kids would sit on our laps for the whole flight. We had problems with check-in because since our seats are side by side in a 3-3-3 seat configuration, oxygen masks that drop in an emergency is 4 per 3 seats. This means that one parent and child sharing a seat can have a mask, along with the two other customers. The solution is to move the third customer in the row of 3 seats to another available seat, or separate the parents into two different rows of the plane. To avoid confusion at check-in, and to save them the trouble of having to shuffle customers around at the last second, we offered to purchase a third seat today for our return flight. We were declined and told we had to cancel our tickets and buy new tickets. This was poor service. As a result, we are stuck with the stress of possibly being separated for the flight back. It shows the blatant disconnect and lack of knowledge between the people you talk on the phone, and the products they offer. To clarify, they did manage to keep us together for our flight here (they had a customer in the third seat beside us.) Had we known about this over the phone when we bought the tickets, we would have bought the third seat in the first place.",Detractor
We flew direct from JFK to Casablanca. This airline is definitely not up to par with other airlines. The plane is shabby with many of the overhead lights and call buttons not functioning. The bathrooms are dirty and not maintained throughout the flight usually no soap and runs out of toilet paper early on. The outbound and returning flights were on time and actually arrived slightly early and our bags arrived intact. On the return flight there were 2 young girls travelling as unaccompanied minors seated across from me. The flight attendants did not check on them throughout the flight. In fact when the meals were served the flight attendant was very brusque with them when asked to choose which meal they wanted. The flight attendants did not show any extra care or compassion for these young girls travelling by themselves. Interestingly we also took a domestic flight from Casablanca to Marrakech and this flight was excellent! The plane was very clean and modern and the service was decent.,Detractor
" Knoxville to Spokane via Minneapolis . I am not sure why I keep trying to fly Delta. I know this time it was to try to get home a little earlier. I seem to always regret it. This time I gate checked my bag to have it left on the tarmac. When I saw it, the employees would not give it to me saying that they could not give it to us because they didn't ""know"" that it was mine. Never mind that I could identify the bag and its contents!! Instead, we had to leave the terminal and claim it at baggage claim (how do they know it is my bag there when they have ripped off the tag) and then go back through TSA (always fun) to try to make my connection. The last time I flew Delta they wanted my 5 year old son to sit 10 rows away from me. Thanks to a kind fellow travelers, we were able to sit together. Delta simply said ""sorry"".",Detractor

Announcements at the airport are made in Polish and English. There weren't many seats at my gate but I was fine standing. Boarded about 10 minutes late via a bus to the plane, a little crowed but luckily the ride was only a minute. Flight attendant at the entrance of the Bombardier Q400 greeting in Polish and English.

That's why Qatar is a 5-star airline by all accounts. On time arrival.",Promoter
"YYZ-LAS return on as part of an AC Vacations package. I'd read the negative reviews online but thought I could suffer the inconvenience for the 4-5 hour flight. Got onboard and was greeted by smiling cheery FA's dressed like they were going to a high school prom as opposed to being professionals but as has been said they were friendly. I managed to squeeze into my seat (15C-aisle) which was not much fun and the plane hadn't even moved yet. I'm 6'3"" and even with legs crossed one knee was in the aisle and the other was encroaching into the space of the middle seat. There is no inflight entertainment (IFE) which is fine as I always bring my iPad anyway but to see the FA's trying to flog rental iPads for $10 was in my opinion a bit tacky especially considering the limited numbers. The FA's appeared very young and generally inexperienced. The dreaded return flight home was equally as bad and I was even looking for alternative routings which would allow me to avoid suffering another 4 hours of discomfort and general amateur performance. Unfortunately I was not so fortunate and flew back to YYZ on the 'red eye' departing LAS at 2330Hrs due to delays (flight was due to depart shortly past 2300 hrs). Again the inexperience and amateur behaviour of supposedly trained FA's was on display with one looking as though he'd just spent all night in a casino as he wandered up and down the aisle with a dishevelled uniform tie loosely done and top button open. Once the initial drink service was completed I expected the main cabin lights to be dimmed so people could sleep but no the lights remained ON during the entirety of the overnight flight which I couldn't understand but of course given the rest of the performance it wouldn't have surprised me if the FA's didn't know how to turn down the lights! Overall Rouge is a discount product being offered as a full fare premium product which is wrong on so many levels. I've flown many low cost carriers in various parts of the world and they all share the same features (or lack thereof) as Rouge yet they're openly advertised and priced as 'low cost' and 'no frills' which is something Air Canada is not doing with Rouge. Never again will I fly this pitiful excuse for an airline lack of legroom not withstanding and if Air Canada does not smarten up and listen to its customer base I will be moving all of my business elsewhere.",Detractor
"  Newark to London. My first impression when checking in the staff seemed friendly but pushed for time meaning the service was quickly over, although it was fast it came across rude when they would hurry me and my travelling friends along. When boarding the aircraft we were welcomed by a lovely set of crew that were happy to point us in the direction of our seats, I was confused as to why there were not any other crew members in the centre of the aircraft welcoming us, like on other airlines I have flown with, all the flight attendants seemed to be in the back galley chatting amongst each other. After takeoff the flight attendants started the service offering drinks, smiling didn't seem like an option for many of the crew I was confused as I noticed across the middle seating that the other crew members were bright and cheerful. The inflight meal was rather poor, I had two options one that I was told was pasta and the other chicken, that's about as much information that I was given so I chose the chicken - it was hardly chicken when there was about four smaller pieces of chicken inside and some bread and a side dish the cheese sauce was vile as it was getting cold by the time the cart had reached me. During the flight two medical emergencies came up with the group I was traveling with, the flight attendants were quick to react and made sure that both passengers where okay. They asked for any medical professionals to step forward and the matter was resolved within around an hour after departure when a travelling nurse was able to help. I think the inflight entertainment system was really great to occupy those who couldn't sleep. Before landing the flight attendants brought out breakfast, this was disappointing because there was so little.",Passive
"  Vienna to Amman with Royal Jordanian. They sent me an email 2 months before my flight from Athens to Amman to inform me that it was cancelled. I called their call center and was advised to visit their sales office. The sales office was very helpful and provided options for the flight to Amman or a refund. I accepted to be re-routed through Vienna to Amman. The check-in agents at Vienna were very nice and helpful. The boarding process was efficient and the flight left on-time and arrived early. The meal consisted of three options (meat, chicken and fish). I opted for the chicken option (chicken with mustard) and it was good. The flight attendants were all very nice and attentive. Overall, I recommend RJ despite the inconvenience of having to transit at Vienna for the flight to Amman.",Promoter
"I was to fly this airline from Santa Rosa to Los Angeles on Nov 13th. The flight was canceled do to weather. Because I had a flight back to Germany at 3 pm that day, I needed to get to LA. They rebooked me from SFO to LAX. I paid 25 dollars for a Bus company to get to SFO from Santa Rosa. When I got there I had to repay a baggage fee I already paid Alaskan Airlines. I got in. Now I got back and I am trying to get reimbursed for the bus fee and the extra bag fee. After waiting 30 minutes to get to the customer care. I was told they would reimburse my bag fee, but not the bus fee or any other fee I incurred. Not happy with their approach to this, nor the ladies attitude on the phone. I expected to be treated fairly. I paid a high price for the ticket to fly out of Santa Rosa. I could have booked the flight that I eventually took and paid 150 Dollars less. I know this cancellation was weather related. But I would have expected the airlines to pay a bill for 25 Dollars to help the excess cost that I had to take upon myself because of this situation.

Gisborne-Christchurch NZ8652 and NZ0525. Wonderful experience travelling with two pre-school age children from Gisborne to Auckland and then on to Christchurch. The whole way was a pleasure with the pilots making our kids day by waving to them from the cockpit and the air hostess that let my daughter handout the sweets.

The plane was new, with redesigned interiors, softer colours and LED lighting. As I am about 1.90 m tall, legroom is very important for me and I felt satisfied with my seat, as I had enough space to stretch my legs. The cabin crew were nice, welcoming and funny, so the flight was pleasant except for the commercial announcements that were very frequent during the journey. The flight was very cheap (around 20 Euros), so onboard sells are a source of profits for the airline. A good no-frills flight with an incredible value for money.",Promoter
"Frontier Airlines. Beware: limited flights schedule changes = stranded for 2 days. Frontier delayed our flight by 5 hours due to ""equipment changes"". Naturally I missed my connecting flight to my destination. Frontier graciously offered to book me onto the next connecting flight - 2 days later. The delay was not because of full flights. It was not due to bad weather. They simply had no scheduled flights for 2 days (48 hours). Frontier provided no offer to book on another airline no offer to refund my ticket except for the single connecting leg no offer to compensate for costs on another airline. No voucher no flight credit. I contacted customer service 3 times. I received 5 hours to sleep in a run-down hotel a half hour from the airport and $15 for an airport dinner.

As someone who had a connecting flight, I had little time to waste to play a guessing game to figure out which direction to go to find the correct gate. I stopped to ask at one of the desk and got the gate information, but that cost me time that was unnecessary. At check-in , I wasn't asked about seating preference. When traveling with family members, without having to ask, we are usually seated in close proximity.

Flew from BOS-SFO-BOS and continue to be impressed it's definitely a cut above the competition. Nice new planes with comfortable leather seats and cool lighting. Crews are always friendly. Good selection of both free satellite TV and pay per view. Also love the online ordering on the seatback TV but wish they stocked just a few more fresh food options (usually you get a choice of a couple of light options such as wraps and salads but wish they would have more substantial choices to choose from). Also the powerports at every seat really makes a difference. One small detail that is easily overlooked but which I greatly appreciate is the Google Maps feature that tracks where your plane is.

On the way over they told her nothing was ordered and were the most rudest people to her about it, they offered her nothing to eat as an alternative and actually told her go and complain about it!

"Extraordinary treatment of passengers by Ryanair. Departing from Stansted very early on Wednesday morning the weather was horrible and raining very hard. The aircraft was off jetty so had to be boarded by steps front and rear. 2 passengers were in wheel chairs and clearly unable to walk at any great speed let alone climb stairs. Boarding commenced with passengers having to walk quickly to the aircraft steps only to find at the rear that one of the elderly was making very slow progress up the stairs. A queue quickly formed as she progressed excruciatingly slowly with help from family members up the stairs. In the meantime, without any cover, passengers waiting to board became totally drenched. I got to my seat as with many others looking literally as if I had just stepped out of a shower fully clothed. Is it really beyond their wit to either have as high loader to facilitate wheelchair passengers onto an aircraft that is off jetty, or if this cannot be managed, hold back general boarding for just 5 minutes while all passengers needing assistance are able to board, thereby avoiding the angst and drenching!",Detractor

"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",Passive
" Toronto to Sydney via Vancouver in Premium Economy. In deciding which airline to take, we put weight on using AC on a direct flight with my partner having 50k Elite. The flaw in this was assuming 50k elite meant something and that a direct flight with one stop was fool proof. After booking the flight, we found we could only select seats available for both legs. So with no twins in a 2-4-2 formation available for both legs, we were forced to select an aisle and middle seat. (though different twins were available on either leg). Call centre and ground staff were unable to allocate different twins available for each leg as it's one flight / boarding card. We bid online for a cash upgrade and initially had money taken from our credit card only to have it returned to our account within hours. A request at the gate in Toronto for a seat change on either leg was answered with ""ask in Vancouver"". An on time departure but a poor meal service. Neither my partner or I got our choice of meal. A very average stew of veal was provided followed by drinks. On spotting an IPA ale on the cart appearing from club, I was told the IPA was a premium beer and not available in PPremium Economy. The service just feels ill thought out with a meal before a drink! At Vancouver, we were told we couldn't swap seats as we should have asked in Toronto! My partner was initially upgraded for free to biz as Premium Economy and Economy were over-sold which was then withdrawn when a connecting flight ran late and all classes suddenly available. Another average ""slop meal"" followed by drinks followed served by a very capable and very senior crew. After this alleged enhanced meal, service morphed into Economy with standard mid flight sandwich and an inedible breakfast. A late arrival was followed by late bags. The day before our return we were informed of a four hour delay. On arriving at the airport we checked in fine, and my partner invited to the Air NZ lounge as a star alliance gold member. (no invite for me as it's it's another airline's lounge) Despite the 4 hour delay the base manager wouldn't budge and bizarrely - no vouchers for food were issued despite an 4 hour+ delay. On boarding, we found out the original crew ran out of hours in Vancouver and it operated 12 hours late to Sydney with a spare crew who needed minimum rest. In terms of upgrades (again), we bid the max for an online upgrade and still didn't' get it. An ok meal served with drinks again served after. On arrival in Vancouver 5 hours late, we found the second leg had left on time with another aircraft and we had been bumped to other flights. (no announcements before arrival into Vancouver) At the gate, we were given PE seats and split up BUT on the original aircraft (with a new flight number in view of our original twin seats) Others from Sydney were in the same position a lot of angry customers feeling let down. Another average meal and drinks rounded off my most average Premium Economy experience ever. On the plus side, all crews were great with plenty of drinks runs. The fundamental design and architecture of this route is flawed. The inflexibility is annoying though when it suits AC, they will split the flight in two to maintain punctuality. Checking back, it is clearly most unreliable AC flight in their entire operation Upgrades were also harder on credits as it's treated as one flight. I would never do an ultra long flight with AC again where so much of the experience is fragile, mis-conceived, late and inflexible.",Detractor
" Istanbul to London Heathrow. The plane itself was old, I found the food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane back, had to be checked in for security purposes. This meant that when I was at Ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks. 1 before check in, one after check in and one before getting on the plane. Because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane. Norwegian offers free wifi so I could check my phone on the plane. British Airways need to improve their service levels.",Detractor
"  Lisbon to Rome with Ryanair. Boarding was simple and fast and although it was an evening flight, we left on time. Cabin crew was helpful and friendly. Boarding was completed in a very short time and the plane left with no delay. The airplane was kept very clean, and it was a pleasant flight. Almost 3h in a low cost airline is something I would expect to be a bit dreary but it was nice. Seats were comfortable and with enough legroom but it was spartan (no pouches to store belongings) and shoulder room was a bit cramped but that is a characteristic of the Boeing 737-800. Quiet flight, simple and efficient service and very fast disembarking. We arrived a bit late but the difference was negligible. It was a good experience and an amazing value for money.",Promoter

" Kiev to Toronto. My flight arrangements allowed me to have 2 carry ons, one 5 kg, and another 7 kg. when I was checking in my suitcase, no one bothered to check, or weight my hand luggage. I passed passport control and customs and, of course, went shopping at duty free. I had 3 plastic bags with duty free purchases. In order not to overwhelm myself with too many bags, I squeezed in all my purchases into my carry on. Before on boarding, 2 wicked staff members started sifting through the passengers to find reasons to rip them off. I was no exclusion. They demanded to put each bag into measuring box, and stated that they were over sized because the bag pockets were protruding from the box. I offered to take out my duty free purchases, but they stated that they would be considered as a hand luggage too, as well as my purse! Any further into that argument, and they would make me to pay for my wallet! All in all, they made me to check in my 7 kilo carry on and pay for it CAD 222.39 (USD 162.21). The wicked staff members were obviously taking pleasure as they were cornering passengers with no escape and no room for solution other than additional payments.",Detractor
"Singapore to Brisbane and Qantas customer service is very poor. The food is dreadful, most of what we ate should not be served to customers. The cabin staff mocked us when we brought this to their attention. Having taken five flights with Emirates in December 2015, we had become accustomed to their excellent service, food and cabin comfort. Flying with Qantas from Singapore to Brisbane was one of the longest seven or so hours of my life. The cabin staff were arrogant, disinterested and in denial regarding the food quality. When I called Qantas the next day to complain they could not care less, a real waste of time. I always think a good test of the quality of any company is how they deal with customer issues, Qantas were very poor in this area.",Detractor

The online checkin was smooth and the check in staff at BKK and LHR helpful. Flights were on time and the aircraft was clean and well maintained on all sectors. The ICE system kept me entertained for hours and I noticed they have changed to new square softer headphones. The transit in Dubai was smooth and professionally controlled. I did not eat anything so I cant comment on the food. The crew were charming, I have noticed a massive shift in crew attitude over the past 2 years.

"I have not even flown with Spirit yet and they are already the worst airline for customer service. I'm trying to do online check-in. This can only be processed in the last 24 hours before the flight (why not 36 or 48 hours before?). Their website is down meaning that I cannot complete online check-in for myself or for my bags, nor print out boarding passes. So, I call them on the phone. First their computer sends me through a maze of options none of which really apply. When I finally find something that is close, they say it will be a 15 minute wait. 15 minutes ends up being 20. Then, when a real person actually answers my call she says that she cannot hear me (of course, I'm waiting on speaker and doing other things while waiting so it takes me a few seconds to pick-up the phone) and she hangs up on me telling me ""for better service"" to call back the very same number that I had been waiting for on hold.

" Berlin to Cincinnati via Keflavik. My nightmare with WOW starts the 26/10/2018 at Berlin, not only because I was traveling for almost 2 days without any support from WOW air what so ever, but also because my bags are still lost somewhere between Berlin and San Francisco. It all start in Berlin when my flight to Keflavik was delayed by almost an hour, from 12.25 pm original time to 13.45. That meant that my connecting flight was almost impossible to reach. Before boarding, I got another email stating that my SFO flight was also delayed but only by 40 min (WW161 KEF-SFO 26OCT18 original time was 15.10 delayed to 15.50) Once landed in Keflavik it was imposible to reach my flight, even when my boarding to SFO was announced I was denied to cut line in customs by WOW personal. They stated that I had time. So when I lost my flight, I went to the WOW counter and was given the solution of flying to Cincinnati even when there was a flight from another airline to SFO that same day. The flight to Cincinnati was at 21.00 the same day. Also, they didn't give me a connection from Cincinnati to SFO, they stated that they where working on it and that we where going to get help by a WOW representative once we got to Cincinnati (other people where in the same position). This never happened, no WOW representative was there once we got of the plane, simply because WOW cease to exist in Cincinnati a few days ago. So, I never got a confirmation of a suppose connecting flight to SFO (some people did and others like me didn't. Their connection was from Cincinnati to Newark to SFO adding a 10 hour plus journey also there was a DELTA flight directly to SFO but was denied by WOW costumer service - I talked to WOW support to try to fix the situation but it was helpless, they even gave me a wrong booking number for my supposed connection, it was named to another person. Luckily I was helped by the United counter, an after an hour of back and forth, they could figure out what WOW messed up. Of course that I had lost my chance to get into the 6 am flight to Newark, so I had to wait for the Cincinnati- Denver 9.25 am flight, and then catch the Denver- SFO at 11.55 am local time (both of this flights where on United) And also, another layer to this nightmare, is that my bags are still lost. They never arrived to Cincinnati in the first place. So to summarize, I was traveling for almost 40 hours, with my bags still lost, and of course the total abandonment of WOW (no food vouchers, no personal, no nothing)",Detractor

Travelled to Cayo Cocco July 3rd 2014. All great except for check in at Toronto Pearson. I had paid $50 extra for the premium package. This gives priority boarding and check in. There is a woman employed by Sunwing that goes along check-in line checking tickets. She told me I was in the wrong line and was to go to the regular line or pay $40 dollars more to stay in the priority check-in line. I knew this was false as the same woman had done the exact thing to myself and my sister in April 2013. At that time I did not know the difference and paid another $50 on top of the $50 already paid. This latest episode by said employee was very embarrassing as she flat out told me loudly I was wrong and to move. I did not move and the girl at ticket desk apologized and assured me that I was indeed in the right line. So beware if you have purchased Premium package and someone tells you that you are not to be in the PremiumElite Plus line and to pay more. I am travelling to Cuba again next month so it will be interesting to see if the same thing happens.,Promoter
"Arriving at Toronto for a tour of Canada, we had no luggage. Air Canada told us it was delayed. So it has been for the 10 days of our stay. Inefficiency and lack of will to solve the problem at Toronto Air Canada baggage desk.

Departing from MontrÃ©al, the first decent and willing to help employee of Air Canada we met managed to retrace our lost suitcase in Toronto - got it redirected to Montreal, and put automatically on our flight back.

Bangkok to Oslo on 787. Paid extra to choose a window seat and brought a packed lunch. I was really delighted with my flight. I'm 6 foot and what really makes a long haul flight good for me is how far forward I can put my feet and how much wiggle room I have for moving my legs. Loads of space here I could cross my legs while the person in front had their seat reclined. This flight easily beat quite a few airlines that I've flown similar routes with in the last couple of years on that alone and that does it for me entirely. I think it was a more upright seating position and less recline in the seats than other airlines maybe not for you if that's what does it for you I could sleep when I wanted no problem. Plus a big fail to Oslo airport who had several hundred international transfer passengers cueing in a corridor to one x-ray machine and expensive beer.,Promoter
PRG-FRA-SIN-FRA-HAM both trips with late evening departures. Compared to other airlines on the route Lufthansa is downright boring but absolutely efficient. The short-haul A320s have zero IFE and only a bare minimum in terms of onboard comfort but the handling and service is flawless. My 19.30 flight from PRG was delayed which would have prevented me from making a tight connection in FRA. Instead baggage drop-off staff already awaited me with a new boarding pass for an earlier flight which was delayed as well and rushed me through fast track to comfortably make my connection. LH even serves sandwiches on the 35min hop to Frankfurt. Both Singapore legs were on the A380 which is always a treat. The cabin is extremely basic and the AVoD is just average but the service is snappy and organized meals are good crews are friendly.

"Having heard lots of horror stories about Iberia long-haul, I was eager to try them given that the reviews did not match the quite satisfying experiences I have had with them on a couple of intra-european flights I have taken with them, and I was pleasantly surprised. It is important to understand that Spaniards talk loud and do not like to beat around the bush, therefore, it sometimes appears like they might be angry or aggressive, while deep down they are more than willing to help! Boarding was carried out in a very organized way. Standing at the door, were a couple of flight attendants welcoming passengers politely. Other members of the crew were helping passengers find their seats and stow their bags. Once airborne, kids received entertainment kits, and passengers got earphones if needed. IFE had a wide range of choices from movies to games and IB information, WiFi and GSM were available, but I did not try it. Meals consisted on pasta or beef, but flight attendants came around a couple of times in case anyone cared for more bread. Coffee or tea was offered. I asked the flight attendant if I could have another glass of water, he mentioned he was busy, but that once he was done, he would bring it to me. I did not wait for more than 2 minutes, he came back with an unexpected glass of water for me in the middle of his tasks! Another flight attendant was equally enthusiastic and happy to help. Overall, service was carried out in a professional and genuine way: no patronizing and no fake smiles. Really looking forward to my return trip on the A340-600!",Promoter

The IFE was pretty extensive, offering movies, TV shows, games, etc, There was a choice of English or Spanish. The air fare was about $650 r/t, but they charge $25 per segment, for an advance seat assignment.

Trip to Fort Lauderdale and back to Toronto on April 12 and 19th. Boarding was disorganized.

Our luggage was off loaded in Fort Lauderdale but nobody announced which of the 13 carousels it was coming down at and the signage at Fort Lauderdale doesn't indicate it for Sunwing. The Fort Lauderdale check-in happens at the west side of terminal 4 the plane is loaded from the east side of terminal 3. Yes a different terminal and the opposite side too. It's a bit of a walk but doable if you don't have much carry on. In Toronto the plane touched down early but nobody was available to guide us to the gate only a 10 minute wait to get to the gate and another 5 or so for the door to be opened. Luggage came out an hour later. Staff near the luggage carousel were unable to find out what the delay was or do anything other than apologize once the luggage did start to come out. Meals - On the way down I had a breakfast muffin. It was warm on one half cold on the other. Soggy pizza about the size of a cheque book on the way back.

And I can't seem to get one contact and one email from anyone to answer. It's now going back and forth since 14 emails and 2 calls and I have not received a response as per why they did what they did. Very disappointing.,Detractor
 I booked a return flight from London to Medellin in Colombia with KLM (and LATAM domestic flight from cartagena to medellin). Due to unforseen circumstances i was unable to make my outbound flight and was forced to rebook the outbound leg. When it came to return to London I checked in for my LATAM flight no problem however the KLM website would not allow me to check in. Upon phoning the customer service department i was told that KLM have a policy that if you miss your first flight they are legally allowed to cancel all of the other flights you have with them. They are not required to inform you that this will happen or provide you with a refund. I was forced to also rebook my return flight with another airline.,Detractor
"  This is the third time we have flown business class from Auckland to London via Hong Kong with Cathy Pacific. The new A350 on the Auckland / Hong Kong leg makes a big difference than the old A340. The crew were most friendly and professional. The window seats for us are the best features / direct aisle access but most of all the privacy from other passengers is what you are paying for. IFE was excellent on the A350 not so clear on the 777-300. The only disappoint for me is the food presentation and quality - its not that flash and could be better. But for us, its the cost and Cathy Pacific prices are far more competitive than than the likes of Air New Zealand, why pay 7000 NZD more each to reach the same destination and sit in inferior business class with no privacy.",Promoter
On Dec 6th our scheduled flight from Vancouver to Nanaimo took off as planned. We had been informed that Nanaimo Airport has a critical density of fog but that they would try to get everybody across. The landing could not be done due to the fog so they flew us back to Vancouver. By that time it was close to midnight. All passengers were asked to go to a nearby service desk. Every single party received a voucher for the Fairmont Airport Hotel and everybody was re-booked for the first flight to Nanaimo the next morning. Very smooth! Very generous!,Promoter
" My husband and I booked our flights months in advance because they were such a great price. Leaving from Pittsburgh, the flights were only 299 USD with cancellation protection. It is a month before we are scheduled to leave and WOW air cancels both our leaving and returning flights. Most airlines that I fly with offer you a lateral alternative so that some indemnity is given to the customer. Not in this case. WOW air only presents customers with two offers: to cancel for a full refund or to cancel and receive a gift certificate worth the cost of your trip and an additional 25%. Although this seems like a nice offer, the tickets to fly out of Boston or New York (as they have cancelled all of the flights from Pittsburgh) are twice the price of what we originally paid. I think WOW air is betting on the fact that customers will have made reservations and would be hesitant to cancel. What a racket. My best advice would be to never book with this company as you will waste time and money in the end. I made some non-refundable accommodations that will now go to waste but in my mind its better than playing into WOW air's deceitful marketing strategy.",Detractor
" Excellent service all the way from Stavanger, first with SAS to Copenhagen, then on to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. I choose Singapore Airlines for the entire trip from Stavanger - Singapore - Melbourne - Mildura- Melbourne - Perth then back to Stavanger via Singapore and London Heathrow mainly because they are part of the Star Alliance Group. All flights left on time and arrived earlier that scheduled. The service was excellent throughout. I particularly enjoyed the trip from Copenhagen to Singapore where I met a delightful young lady who was a member of the cabin crew. She took time to chat even though they were quite busy. I have flown with Singapore Airlines several times before",Promoter
 Atlanta to Paris. I always thought that Air France is a good airline. I used them several times and I want people to know that crew on board the plane is fantastic no problems there whatsoever.

I've never being humiliated in that way in my life.,Detractor
"  I just had the most inspiring journey with Garuda Indonesia on the way back home to Bali from Osaka. All the flight was normal until the meal service. The cabin crew ran out of options during the meal service. The options were japanese chicken rice and the other one was fish with rice, yet only the fish left. The crew showed me the fish rice, which personally I must say very not appetizing. Then, he took initiative to try to find me the Japanese chicken rice, which was completely finished on board. Finally, he went to the galley, and offered the crew meal, which was chicken with indonesian yellow rice. I agreed to take this. I was amazed by the crew's action to go beyond my expectations. I must be very honest and say that the crew meal tasted much better.",Promoter
" We had a short 1.5 hour flight from Vancouver to Calgary with a quick 30 min. layover in Kelowna. We got off the plane, and the next flight was delayed (we were suppose to board the same plane, but just pick up some passengers in Kelowna.) They come on the intercom and say the plane is broken so we need to call a number to re-book our flight to Calgary or get a partial refund. (Yes, it was our responsibility now.) We needed to get to a wedding reception, so time was of the essence. All 4 of us were on the phone trying to re-book the next flight, and we were put on hold. And hold. And hold. Then they came back saying they got us tickets, then put us on hold again. Finally came back and said ""sorry the next flight is now full"", but they have a flight leaving in a few hours with a layover in Edmonton and to arrive in Calgary around 9pm. We needed to get there so we jumped on that flight before it was full, we got new boarding passes, and went to sit at White Spot for some drinks. We waited about 2.5 hours and then that flight was now delayed. About an hour later they told us that the flight was now cancelled. So we just wasted hours in the airport waiting for nothing. We tried calling customer service but there were no more flights that evening and the next one was at 7:30 in the morning. FWe had called to ask for a refund so that we could jump on a flight with WestJet, but they said that was ""unlikely"" to happen. So now we were trying to get hotel vouchers, nobody would give us any sort of solid information. Every person we talked to told us to go talk to another person, or to call a different number. One guy had told us that all their hotel vouchers were ""exhausted"". So not only did they royally screw us for the entire day and night, but we weren't even going to get any sort of accommodation. The only good person we dealt with was an amazing lady who finally pulled some strings to get us a hotel, and she was helpful and knowledgeable. If anything goes wrong they make you fend for yourselves when having to re-schedule your flights in a city you are unfamiliar with.",Detractor
Traveled from Trenton NJ to Fort Myers week before Thanksgiving. It was one of the most pleasant flights I've had in a long time. They have a small terminal in Trenton not like dealing with Newark. Check-in staff were nice and security was quick. They have a tiny store in the small waiting area to buy snacks/drinks. Plane was about 30 minutes late but once it got there they had us boarded and doors closed in about 15 minutes. They boarded from the middle to front and middle to back - common sense! Flight crew very pleasant. I didn't like the idea you could only purchase drinks or snacks or TV with a credit or debit card no cash. The plane was very clean restrooms spotless flight quiet and comfortable. In Fort Myers I went to the first baggage claim to find my luggage already on the rack. I spent less than five minutes in Fort Myers airport! Return flight was on time and flight crew was also fun. Boarding was organized: first 4 rows then those who had carry-ons that would fit under the seat. I got on then and everyone with bags for overhead got on quickly with much less stress than the Continental flight I took in May. Return flight the same as the first quiet and on time. I had to pay $25 for my luggage each way but not for carry-on. For me this was a great value: $178 round trip and $50 total for baggage. From the comments above some encounter problems with Frontier but it seems to be mostly on connecting flights. I will definitely give Frontier another try as my experience this time was very good!,Promoter
Returned recently from a trip to SEA from ANC and SDF (on Am Eagle) to ORD then onto ANC. All flights were well run affairs with fine crews and great service. I flew First and when I get upgraded I always enjoy the experience. I am however more than pleased when I do not move up as the rest of the plane service crew does a fine job.

I have about six more flights scheduled in the next half year and I plan to fly them every time. Please keep it up!,Promoter
"Madrid to Bogota on new seat configuration for A340/600. Awful experience! Seats are crammed and uncomfortable staff are rude food is so so. If you can avoid Iberia. Only good thing is the tray table that can be pushed aside so that you can get up which out having to clear it first. The new seat configuration has certainly gained for Iberia a few more seats but this means for the traveller an incredible loss of comfort. It looks like you are in a cage and keep bumping with everything. When seated on one side of the seat there is an unmovable table which takes up so much space and one of your arms cannot move freely without bumping into it. Under this table is where the feet of the fellow victim behind you are resting. When laying down be careful when trying moving your feet! You will bump into the tray of your fellow passenger in front of you and it will hurt I can assure you. Regarding inflight entertainment earphones are far from noise cancelling. Movies are only available in Spanish or English. They say they have up to 50 movies but I could only find 2 of interest. My TV set crashed and it took 30 minutes for the flight attendant to reset it. But I understand them there were only 4 of them for so many rows of business cages to take care of. This does not explain anyway their bad attitude. One lady asked for the complimentary beauty kit when she boarded the plane and the flight attendant told her ""not now!"". Food is served in a rush smiles are rare and far in between. After serving food staff just disappear. Food is so so. On a 10 hours flight they gave us only one meal and wine choice is limited to five Spanish wines and one champagne (Spanish cava). It has to be said that the wines are good. Some of the starters were nice but the main dish was not. Presentation is extremely poor as table is not laid out for you but food is served inside small plastic boxes on a tray. Very little difference with what you get in economy class. The hot towel was coldish and did not serve its purpose. Bathroom was never cleaned soap and toilet paper finished one hour before arrival.",Detractor

" I was very frustrated, not to say shocked with the apparently new Austrian service plan. First, Austrian puts 10 seats in one row of a 777 (3-4-3), while other airlines fly with 9 seats per row only. That by itself makes it hard to feel comfortable, since you are always in direct contact with the neighbour's shoulder. The worst however is the service. The food consisted of a 2 cm by 2 cm large piece of meat, a spoon of mashed potatoes and one carrot (see photo), served in a disposable triangle. Drinks were only offered once, following the new service plan of Austrian. When I complained about food and service one of the flight crew members told me that this is the new service directive and food service from Austria. The crew were not happy with it either and indeed felt embarrassed about the quality. All these little extras, that make a flight a little bit more comfortable are missing on Austrian. The nuts and drinks prior to the dinner, the hot (paper) towels prior to dinner and breakfast, nobody went through the cabin offering drinks. I emphasize, that I do not blame the crew. Indeed, they were all very friendly and helped as much as they could. But what can you do if there is not enough food/drinks on board and the company asks you to reduce the service to an absolute minimum. Well, I made my decision. Austrian long haul flights, never again.",Detractor

 Absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced. My flight out of Chicago left a few minutes early which I thought was great as it would leave me more time with my layover. Somehow we landed over 30 minutes late which left me rushing to my terminal. By the time I got there they had already finished boarding. I immediately rushed over to the customer service stand and explained my situation. As I'm trying to get something worked out I can see my plane for the next 15 minutes still sit at the terminal. I was told there was nothing they could do as it was out of there control with the plan being late. That they could offer suggestions on where I can get a hotel for the night which I would be paying for out of pocket until the next flight over 12 hours later. They couldn't offer any food or hotel vouchers. Whole time this conversation is happening the lady helping me was talking to her co-worker also laughing in my face. When I asked to speak to the manager because at this point it was beyond acceptable the lady she was laughing with and talking to instead of helping me chimed In she was in fact the manager and there is nothing they could do for me. All of this adds into the horrible customer service which led me to having to cancel two round trip tickets previously for my daughter and myself due to the hurrican hitting south Carolina and me having to change my plans. On those I didnt get reimbursed I only got a partial credit. I will never fly spirit again. This is unacceptable treatment of their customers.,Detractor
" In the old days Ryanair meant ""Low fares simple"". Now it means ""Low fares with loads of hidden costs"". Very poor and unprofessional service from boarding to flight attendants. All starts at boarding where a tag with limited liability is attached to your hand luggage if you don't pay ""Priority"" (which btw, seems to be bought by half the passengers nowadays). The ""fake receipt"" is then glued onto your ID which once resulted in one staff member actually breaking my plastic ID card. This tag is so made up you can just rip it off and try your luck getting your hand bag into the cabin. If you are traveling with your SO or a child, expect to pay just to sit together because it will purposely ""randomly"" allocate you as far as possible. Inside the cabin, you'll find the worst flight attendants the aeronautic industry has to offer. Those who often bump into everyone and will actually hurt you when you have an aisle seat, obviously without any apologies, that keep selling lottery tickets enhancing the flea market spirit even when turbulence requires all passengers to be seated. They sometimes forget to perform the safety procedures demonstration from start because they're on the phone. I once even heard one of them screaming when we ""bumped"" into some turbulence! Good luck trying to sleep if there are constant announcements over food, perfumes, tickets and other diversified sales. Also, Ryanair seems to think they're above EU regulations, no beverages are offered in case of a significant delay. Now the plus: It's simple and sometimes very cheap (although it often requires you to waste tons of money and pay exorbitant train tickets to reach its remote airports) Ryanair keeps growing without proper scaling and training, disregarding its customers and aiming towards maximum profit only.

"April 28 YYZ-NAS. I booked Rouge Premium. We boarded fairly quickly and efficiently were offered juice and water while still at the gate newspapers as well pushed-back and took off on time. FAs were friendly perky and a bit informal and their service throughout the flight was courteous and efficient. Food and drinks were exactly the same as Air Canada mainline Business. The big downside of Rouge are the seats I'm 6ft 3 and weigh 220lbs. I had just enough legroom so my knees did not bang into the seat in front of me and I was able to cross my legs no problem. There is definitely less legroom between the Rouge Business seats and the Air Canada Business seats. The seats are pitiful on the recline only 3 inches and is pretty useless. The seats on Rouge are called ""New Slimline Seats"" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some. No inflight TV screen on the seatbacks just the foldaway meal table a-la 1970s aircraft seats along with a couple of pockets. My Rouge flight was only half-full so as I said service and food were up to Air Canada mainline standards in Business class but the Rouge business class seats comfort and space are a definite step down. I paid the same airfare for less legroom less comfortable smaller seat and less space as I paid 4 months ago for a standard business class seat and space on the same route with regular Air Canada.

"  Gatwick to Melbourne via Hong Kong. Pleased with Gatwick on lunchtime departure. Just check for South Terminal at F Gate, Nice casual boarding [unlike the demeaning line up and wait at Hong Kong]. Cabin staff always welcoming and helpful. Every seat taken - seems a Cathay method. Typically a polite crowd to travel with, majority Chinese, a few Australians and British. I had a low calorie meal on order, so got served maybe 30 minutes ahead of others and by personal delivery. Out of Gatwick the main was delicious fish - very good even if no choice and no menu. Captain message as usual on this airline was English name and well spoken. I rate this airline for having British pilots - gives me confidence in basic skills and also the ability to communicate clearly in the event of difficulties. I told myself the A350 has been in service on this route for over a year, and is used intensively, flying into Gatwick after 11 hours from HK and ready to return at lunchtime. The Cathay themed seats in aqua green are starting to look tired, as also the furniture in the toilets [Try liifting the lid and some stain on the rim]. I require several breaks from sitting as I rarely get to sleep. So I found a small space near the aft toilet where I could pass 30 minutes doing easy knee and toe exercises without being hassled by the crew. [This used to be easier on the 747 with its extra space]. The allocation of toilets was just ok, I counted five located midway and aft. The nice thing about the A350 is that it is not carrying huge numbers, easier to manage. The meals are only average, lacking some extras such as hand towel and block of real cheese. Wine [red or white] comes in a plastic glass - gone is the mini bottle. On boarding, there is no welcome juice or hot towel. The seats feel spacious but are short on supportive cushioning. I actually bolster the seat with the blanket and pillow to support low spine and thighs. The choice of movies is good but falls short of the Qatar Airways range. I enjoy checking the route out over Lowestoft and north to Denmark and the baltic states before an amazing great circle route over Russia through to China. I enjoy the live video cams showing take off and landing. Fortunately daytime on transit in Hong Kong Airport [It is depressingly closed there on night time transits] found a western style breakfast cafe. But kept wishing it was Singapore with its fantastic restaurants. From there Cathay lost points by transferring us to a tired looking B777ER and lining us up like cheap people for 30 minutes before boarding. They could do this much better. Deperture 30 minutes late was not made up. On attempted touch down in Melbourne [shown on video] the pilot aborted landing at the last moment and took off for another attempt. He blamed cross winds for this but I suspect the speed and decline were out of sync. Arrived 4 minutes late turning 11.05 pm. Just one thing to remember, on arrival at Gatwick the Cathay gate is very remote and there are no airport toilets for that sudden need, for maybe 20 minutes hard walking. Impression, love the airline its helpful crew and the route but will have to compare Qatar on price and miss the comfort of Singapore Airport. Disappointed by the B777ER on the Melbourne leg.",Promoter
"Without question, the most unhelpful ground staff that I have encountered and I travel almost weekly both internationally and domestically. The aircraft cabin crew were great. The aircraft was an old (very old!) Boeing 767-300, and the ""Premium Economy "" seats were a joke. The aircraft was delayed by 3 hours in Newark because of ""the inbound aircraft not being available"" and when the aircraft finally did arrive, it developed a ""computer fault"" that further delayed departure by another hour. What I found incredibly frustrating was the complete lack of customer service by United staff at Newark. They obviously view customers as a hindrance. Never again.",Detractor
I bought a so called business class ticket from Sal Cap Verde to London via Lisbon. It was over 1000 euros one way and a night flight leaving at midnight arriving via Lisbon change of plane at 10.30 am. It was appalling! So called business class seats were ordinary economy seats on both flights. Food was very ordinary. No biz class check-in or priority boarding. Change of plane at Lisbon was awful with buses everywhere business lounge wasn't signposted and had to go through security twice at 05.30 am. No inflight entertainment to speak of just a central few screens and no headphones offered.,Detractor
"Dublin to Bristol. On time and good value - what more can one ask for on an hours flight ? There is rather a lot of queuing to get on and off and the seats are not very comfortable.

"First time taking Air France premium economy. Seating configuration was 2x4x2. The seat was a fixed seat which reclined by sliding downward and forward along the shell of the seat. Leg space was generous with a retractable footrest. A personal adjustable reading light was useful in addition to the overhead lights. Each seat had inbuilt noise reducing headphones which significantly reduced engine noise. The inflight entertainment was excellent with a large selection of movies and music. The interactive moving flight tracking map was fun to use. Catering was excellent with a good choice of entree, starter and drinks. On the whole, the extra â‚¬350 spent for premium economy is worth it for a long haul flight.",Promoter

" Detroit to New Orleans. When we boarded at 6am they gave us a boarding pass with a gate number for our connecting flight, we had 20 minutes in North Carolina to get to our connecting flight to New Orleans, we ran and made it 10 minutes early to gate, lobby was full of people waiting, we thought plane was late but after waiting half hour asked someone and was told gate was changed! There wasn't anyone there to let people know or a notice put up, nothing. We were then told that the new gate flight had already left, they changed it during the 2 hours we were in the air in our first flight. We complained and they insisted it was our own fault because they said they never print gate numbers on their tickets, when I showed them my ticket with a gate number on it that they had given me 3 hours previous they said it was still our fault for not looking at the monitors. They also said we should have known when no one was waiting, but lobby was full of people waiting. I went to speak to manager and she rebooked my party of 5 on the next flight 8 hours later so we waited and we had a non refundable tour booked in New Orleans that we were now missing. The manager said she could upgrade 4 to 1st class and would write notes to put me on stand by for 1st available stand by so I could be with my family. When we were boarding I asked about my stand by and he said there were no notes and he had no authorization so he called and she had left for day, so manager lied to us! Also we had paid extra to have seats together which now were not together and were told we would get refunded that extra, on our statement they refunded and then recharged again so in truth there was no refund! They took no responsibility and had the worst customer service. They were very rude to us after they inconvenienced us. Thank God our cruise was leaving next day because we would have missed our cruise too. Also it costed $210 for 3 pieces of luggage which is ridiculous.",Detractor

The lounge monitors were inaccurate and the CIP lounge staff incompetent. No information, no announcements, no service. They refused to rebook onto other airlines and failed to deal with customers properly. When we finally got on our way we arrived 34 hours late. As to the long haul flight: avoid the A330-200.

"We recently flew from Honolulu to Vancouver on the red eye - not because we chose a red-eye but unless we flew to Alberta we did not have a choice!

The same issues noted on previous reviews existed - cramped seats old shows/movies minimal cabin service inconsistent temperature aisle space must only barely meet standards reading lights not working (quote from an attendant ""working reading lights are not an airline safety requirement"" which was the response I got when I finally tracked down 2 attendants who initially both said they would check out why the lights weren't working or get me a mobile reading light and who never got back to me). We have decided to use our remaining Aeroplan miles on non- Air Rouge flights and then book with Westjet or US airlines for future trips. In addition to our recent negative experience another consideration to drop Air Canada was an Air Canada employee on a previous interaction said that no one likes Air Rouge but do not expect Air Canada to make any changes. Why would one stay with an airline who doesn't value their economy customers. AC would have to make some significant improvements to show that they actually care about customers to have me even consider flying with them in the future!",Detractor

I especially loved the sesame chicken with tabbouleh salad and sesame soy dressing - so delicious! It was also a nice touch before departing Sydney a menu was handed out detailing the food to come and at what time during the flight it would be served. The inflight entertainment system was fantastic with so much to choose from, including films that had just been released in cinemas. And finally the cabin crew - were professional and friendly.

"Flew Air India Dubai to Delhi return. Boeing 787 with a spacious cabin and excellent leg room. The service is a bit lethargic and inflight entertainment is not the most engrossing compared to other airlines. Food and beverages were up to the mark. The staff seems a bit unprofessional as it took loads of time at check-in at Delhi. Even the cabin staff seems drained out and it's not the most cordial staff you would encounter on a trip. IFE can be improved as the content is not enough, and is pretty slow and primitive considering it is a new aircraft. On the flight from Delhi to Dubai, the cabin crew ran out of vegetarian food which resulted in chaos and people just getting half the meal. Air India was a better option to fly to Delhi over competitors mainly due to the cabin and food.",Promoter

Departing from Vegas couldn't have been anymore of a nightmare. Flight originally leaving at 5.25 pm, with a delayed flight until 9.55pm, actually didn't leave until after 1am. Explanation?

In the past 6 months, I have had one flight delayed by 3h, one flight cancelled within 1h of departure with no explanation and with alternative flights offered 2 days later. Like we have not got jobs to go to. I have complained directly to them to claim the european inconvenience payment of â‚¬400 per person and they claimed 'extraordinary circumstances' in both situations. We went through a law firm and they managed to get our payment for both cases. Recently, they have also changed the luggage on board rules and supposedly, they take all small hand suitcases to hold. We boarded the plane among the first 10 people and our suitcase was taken to hold. There were at least 30 suitcases (we counted, and we stopped counting after a while) which were taken on board after we boarded. So what is this s#1t? If only a certain number of suitcases are allowed on board, why don't they offer to allow people to check their hand luggage in advance? The staff have always been incredibly condescending and there seems to be a lack of training across the company as we have always been given contradicting explanations for the concerns we have raised. They really need to get their act together. I'd definitely recommend paying a little bit more to buy a flight with any other airline.",Detractor

The stopover meant an extra 4 hours added to the journey, which meant I missed my connecting flight. On landing in Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific staff were waiting to assist passengers with connecting flights. Amazingly they had already sorted out onward flights, new boarding passes and for those who had onward flights rearranged for the next day like me, they had already organised overnight accommodation and transfers. I didnt have to ask for anything! Every detail was explained and sorted out for me before I'd even stepped off the plane. That's why its worth paying a few pounds more for a decent airline, giving you peace of mind for if and when unexpected situations occur.",Promoter
" Turin to London Gatwick. Rubbish check-in service, as bad as Ryanair. I show the staff my mobile boarding pass, checked website that I have 2 x 32 kg bags checked allowance. One bag was over 23 kg (27/28), they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me I will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in. They were so rude and unhelpful. Boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner. Flight was delayed without the checked-in agent saying anything, after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather. At the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait.",Detractor
"  Flew from Phuket to London Heathrow via Guangzhou on Feb 25th and cannot fault anything. Having always flown Emirates I was slightly apprehensive but it was one of the best flights I have been on. It was really quiet, no announcements every few minutes and the cabin crew were polite and nothing was too much trouble. We flew with my 11 year old daughter who had a kids meal spaghetti bolognaise so she was happy and ate the lot - the food was generally very good. They ran out of omelette for breakfast and were so apologetic. Not much bar choice - red and white wine and beer, lots of soft drinks and the coffee was good. Inflight entertainment was limited but we slept most of the flight anyway. Would definitely recommend China Southern.",Promoter

Had my first experience with Air Canada Rouge and will never use it again. It was by far the worst flight experience I have ever had.

"  Chicago to Punta Cana. Normally I am not a type who would write reviews. But we were really wowed by the in-flight service we experienced. In February me, and my sister decided to take a trip to Punta Cana and meet up with our brother and his family who flew in from Europe. My sister was in-charge of booking the trip, and at first I was not happy with her choice to fly with Frontier Airlines. Frontier being a budget airline, and the reputation of nickel and dime'g by the budget airlines was kind a turn off for me specially flying international. From the moment we settled in the seat I was wrong about the perception I had of Frontier Airlines. The seats were very comfortable and one flight attendant was exceptionally friendly and kind. Hardly ever experienced the kind of friendliness and welcoming attitude from a flight attendant ever before. We constantly bugged him to buy more drinks and nuts and he was always there with a smile.",Promoter
I recently made a lightening trip to and from New Zealand to attend my mother's funeral. I did get rather confused at Heathrow and ground staff at Heathrow were extremely helpful they must have notified ground staff at Abu Dhabi as someone was there to meet me take me through security on to a lovely lounge and escort me back later to the aeroplane. This also occurred on my return trip when I touched down at Abu Dhabi on Fri 24 April. I will use Etihad when possible in the future.,Promoter

Traveled from Regina SK. to Puerto Vallarta on Feb 22nd. I was a little worried after reading all the negative reviews but I thought that Sunwing was great. The flight crews on both our flights were very nice and provided good service. Granted the food onboard wasn't great but what do you want for airline food. We booked the Elite Plus and I am happy that we did. The extra leg room was a huge bonus. We also avoided the long lineup at the airport coming home. The only things that I didn't like were that the transfer bus from the airport didn't have a list of names of people that should be on the bus. I have no idea how they knew when they had everyone of if someone was missing. I also didn't like that you had to see the Sunwing reps the morning after arriving to book the shuttle back to the airport. We ended up waiting quite awhile to see a rep as people were booking excursions. If hotel transfers are included in the package price you shouldn't be required to talk with a rep.,Promoter
" I've been flying Cathay Pacific London to Hong Kong and back for nearly ten years now. Here's why. I started off flying Virgin because I'd already accumulated air miles with them and the price was right. However I soon found out that their airline staff are overworked and tired, food was mediocre and, worst of all, I still couldn't acquire enough points to get into the Business Lounge despite frequent flying. A quick calculation showed that if I joined Marco Polo club I'd go Silver after a few flights and I would get to book extra legroom seats free of charge with the advantage of extra luggage allowance plus being able to check in and queue for the flight using Business Class. No brainer then! Over nearly a decade Cathay have kept up their good service on-board. It seems like the airline staff can't do enough for you, including serving snacks and noodles and drinks throughout the flight. Meals are good (and much better when they upgrade me to Premium Economy or Business which happens when the flight is full), the entertainment system is excellent and the extra legroom seat option is a bonus. Having said that, relatively recent changes to the seating has resulted in less padded seats with a recline method that is uncomfortable, making it difficult to sleep, so deduct a star for that. Overall I'll continue to fly Cathay simply because the staff make a 12hr journey so much more pleasant than many other airlines.",Promoter

Traveled from NY (JFK) to DEL (IGI) in May 2014. The ticket was slightly more expensive than other airlines but the flight was half empty. The plane was a Boeing 777-300ER with a very nice cabin and a 3-3-3 configuration (unlike 3-4-3 on most other airlines). I requested the air hostess to move me from the front row to some empty seats behind and she happily did so. I was in the center aisle and both seats besides me were empty I could sleep (laid on 3 seats) all the way through without any disturbance. The food was excellent staff was good and the in- flight entertainment was nice (not the best but you will like it esp. if you are an Indian). Flight was on time.

Hot food served (some kind of chicken tortilla) with box of Godiva chocolates. Very smart and modern design of drink glass ( like iceberg).

Seat next to should be kept empty like other airlines do.

"Like many of the reviewers, I am not a novice at traveling. This is a good thing and this is probably what ""caught"" me. I have never had to read the fine print to enjoy my flight. Like many, the biggest tip is read the fine print. You will pay for everything. Every piece of luggage, pay for your seat reservation in both directions - if you want to be sure to sit next to your loved one, and even a glass of water. I did not do this so my experience was horrible. No reclining seats, no food and the airline personnel were not friendly. So, what I thought was going to be a cost savings ended up being a bit more then if I had flown an airline that I have more frequently used where I would have been more comfortable and they would have at least given me water and some nuts. I traveled from the U.S. to Colombia so it was not a short trip across the U.S. If you are prepared for all these things and the trip is shorter, then you may be better prepared.",Detractor
PEK-LAX. New 777-300ER was completely full a very young crowd so much excitement during boarding. Once underway the passengers were very well-behaved. Crew reasonably friendly and immaculately presented. Two hot meals - one soon after takeoff and another about 5 hours before landing. After the second hot meal sandwiches were distributed for passengers to snack on for the remainder of the flight. Entertainment was a good selection of movies on individual screens. Pushed on time to the minute and landed forty mins late due to headwinds. Only complaint is almost all pax on Air China are Chinese and hence all have visas which means each pax takes longer for US immigration - which can be interminable at the best of times - will take an hour unless you're one of the first off the plane. For me it took 1h20m to clear immigration which was also the case when I flew the airline PEK-LAX last year. Other than that charming and professional will definitely fly Air China again.,Promoter

  Manila to Melbourne via Sydney with Qantas. Check in was swift and polite request to change was done with any issue at all. Lounge in MNL was basic but good. Boarding a bit late but priorities respected. The first flight was an A330-300. Crew on this flight were like chalk and cheese. Some were extra charming and professional but others were extremely rude. Flight departed 30 minutes late. Had issues with IFE that took nearly an hour to fix. Food on Qantas was pathetic and stingy. So called supper served on a 8pm flight assuming passengers do not need to be fed. Dessert had a cheese plate which actually had one piece of cheese. During dinner service one of the male crew was so rude to a kid that his father had to speak to the purser. It was disappointing to witness this. Seats on the newly refurbished A330-300 are comfy and fantastic for a good night rest. Short flight time meant arrived in Sydney before time. Being one of the first flights of the day immigration and baggage claim was very fast. Second leg to MEL was a Domestic Configured A330-200. Usual run of the mill flight. No complaints. Good flights but behaviour of some cabin crew is not acceptable.,Passive
"DXB-MEL, 12.5 hrs, second leg of CAI-MEL on Qantas ticket but first leg operated by Emirates.

Aircraft new and well kept with comfortable seating. Boarding was fine and departure on-time. Although seats quite close together for such a long flight the leg room was good due to IFE being kept out of the way. Meals were pretty good and staff came around offering snacks and drinks regularly. IFE excellent - I found a good range of films and my kids were kept happy for the whole flight as well. They did most things well, but a few little things let them down: - Not enough immigration forms for all passengers. (Honestly, they know the number of pax on a flight, it can't be that hard) - When I asked for an amenities kit about 1.5 hrs before landing, they told me they had run out. - Flight path maps weren't working so it was hard to tell where we were.

" Kigali to Ho Chi Minh City via Doha â€“ both flights on time â€“ I sat in seat 2K on both flights (B787-8). Lounge access smoothly provided in KGL and DOH and they were both excellent. All Boarding Passes issued at Check-In in Kigali. Online check in possible but constitute a nuisance as the BP issued are not respected/valid in KGL. Flights from Central Africa are derouted from KGL to DOH which cost some 2-3 hours additional flight time due to flight ban over UAE. Pre-departure drinks offered on both flights. Inflight entertainment was not working properly so had to change seat (1st flight). FA and service onboard good, but food is poorer than before. E.g. no beef or fish are available. Lamb chops appeared to be some tough meat. Drinks are fine but sparsely loaded (they ran out of 2 beer brands and remained with Heineken only). No ice-cream. Doha-Saigon leg was a perfect flight, the FAs were fantastic, very proactive and truly caring. Food was much better on this leg as compared to the previous. Got a delicate cod as main dish.

Flew from IST to ESB on A321. The Business class configuration is typical of the European short haul flights with the middle seat left empty. Legroom is limited and hardly an improvement over Economy. Aircraft was showing its age and as with all TK flights I have been on the air was stuffy and stale. Flight attendants came across as aloof and did not seem to be interested in engaging with the passengers beyond the most basic requirements of their duties. Good meal service for a short flight. There was moderate turbulence throughout the flight resulting in spilled drinks. The FA's did not bother to clean up the spill on my table even though it was evident at the time they collected the meal service. The crews on TK really need to improve their English skills as their announcements are barely understandable and would represent a real concern in the event of an emergency. As well my experience on all of TK flights leave me questioning the safety culture of the FA's as they tend to ignore basic in-flight safety breaches such as passengers standing up while the aircraft is taxiing and leaving their tables down during takeoff and landings. The flight left late due to congestion at Istanbul airport but was otherwise uneventful. Their domestic service is clearly superior to North American and many European carriers and is certainly good value for money. With some attention to cabin service and improved FA performance this airline can easily maintain its status as Europe's best but has a long way to go to compete with Asian and Middle Eastern carriers on long-haul routes.,Detractor

" MÃ¼nster/OsnabrÃ¼ck to KrakÃ³w via Frankfurt. Half an hour before departure there was an announcement that the flight to Frankfurt of 6:35AM was cancelled. So, we went back to the check-in desk. There we were put on the 2:40PM flight, 8 hours later. They did give us 10 euro per person for food and drinks, which was sufficient. After 8 hours of waiting it was finally time for boarding. However, this didn't go as planned either, because we had an aborted takeoff due to an overheated engine. We had a bit of hope that it would be fixed in 10 minutes, but after we were told that the luggage is on the carousel, we went back to the check-in desk again. This time we were put on the flight of 6:20PM, and also got an additional 22 euro for food and drinks per person. That quickly became 7:10PM after a delay. Then, 13 hours late, we finally took off to FRA on the 30 minute flight. Apart from this all, the flight was smooth and uneventful. FRA is a huge airport with lots going on, yet it is quite easy to find your way.

You have to download their Air Canada app to watch streaming entertainment on your tablet/mobile. The overhead bins in the 767's were super tiny though. About as small as the bins in a regional jet. Food was average - but serviceable. Would totally fly with them again especially to Morocco since there is a laptop ban from flights from Morocco directly to the USA!",Promoter
" I booked and paid for a direct flight from Manado to Denpasar in January 2018. then in April I got an automated mail that my direct flight had been cancelled and switched in a flight to Jakarta followed by a flight to DPS, adding almost 3 hours of extra travel. No apology, nothing. When I complained to Garuda, I didn't get an answer to my mails. Garuda in the Netherlands answered after a considerable wait but just confirmed that by Indonesian law I needed to accept this. Garuda's response was unsatisfactory especially knowing that we paid a significantly higher price for the direct flight, have lots more travel time and now due to Garuda were late for meeting with our friends. because we were informed last minute, all other flight options from other airlines had already been booked so we were left with no alternative. Garuda send us 2 days in advance e ticket boarding cards for the direct flight which had been cancelled. when we complained on this the answer was that it was just a mistake. an airline which sends boarding cards for non existing, cancelled flights? From Manado to Jakarta (a 3 hour flight), the inflight entertainment system did not function no communication was made during the flight why this occured. The second flight I got a chair without a left armrest it was broken off meaning that the chair could not be reclined and the headphone sound didn't work with the inflight entertainment system.",Detractor
August 16 2013. Supposed to travel to Punta Cana that day from Cincinnati. We were told there was a slight delay and we would depart an hour later. That hour turned into a 20 hour delay reason being said because someone on the returning flight got very sick and the solution (IV bag) was used on that person and they could not fly us back out until the solution was replaced. They had no other plane to put us on and we would fly out the next morning. Yes they gave us a voucher to use at the airport but by that time everyone had already eaten and also the airport stores were closed. They gave us free hotel rooms near the airport and a shuttle service. Needless to say we arrived in Punta Cana a day later and they did reimburse us for a small amount of the daily room charge.,Detractor
"My first time flying Vueling Airlines and both flights (Seville to Palma return) were fine. Both flights were on time, actually arrived ahead of schedule on return flight. Older A320 feels cramped and worn, but the newer (winglets) A320, with Recaro seats, give more knee room. The all-female cabin crew were friendly and efficient, both ways. Check-in was also no-hassle. Offered ""window or aisle"" seat, without asking and tickets were issued at the desk, free of charge. I would rate Vueling about the same as Easyjet - a similar level of service and value for money. I will use again.",Passive
LGW to ALC: Excellent no fuss quick and easy check in. This experience was also matched by the boarding process and inflight service. Very good communication and friendly approachable cabin crew. There was a screen and although no headphones it certainly occupied you with something to visualise upon at least. Incredibly quick flight in lovely comfortable seats. Sat in row 1 with plenty of leg room. We have no problems with this airline and are looking at their long haul service.,Promoter
" Bogota to Toronto. There was no Spanish speaking staff on the flight. I had to translate for the passenger seating beside me. The crew spoke a lot over the PA about things that were not important (creating memories, and other irrelevant information) and did not provide information like length of flight, temperature on arrival, etc. The pilot never greeted the passengers with information about the flight. They have an app for their entertainment system and the choices are outdated and extremely limited. There is no radio option to listen to varied music. The flight left in the evening and instead of offering a dinner, they offered a breakfast. I was starving when I went on board and I was offered only a candy bar and chips. Nothing till around 4 hours after and it was a breakfast choice. The ground crew were extremely disorganized on check in and boarding.",Detractor

No other airline has delays or cancellations in the country either, other airlines are going to the same places that I am and are still going.",Detractor
"London Heathrow to Albuquerque via Dallas Fort Worth. The staff at Heathrow and on the flight were helpful, seats in economy were comfortable enough (would pay for main cabin extra next time just for the leg room), and the food satisfactory for a picky vegetarian like myself. The same goes for my domestic flight to ABQ, where everything was smooth and pleasant. I had some issues on my return flight, but the staff couldn't have been better. My flight from ABQ to DFW was delayed by 2 hours, which meant I had 10 minutes to make my flight to LHR on arriving at DFW. American Airlines staff at ABQ bumped me to main cabin extra so I could be one of the first off of my domestic flight, and put me on reserve for a later to flight to LHR if I missed my designated flight. Of course, they were sceptical about my luggage making the same flight given the allotted window, but talked me through the procedure for delayed luggage. I actually made my flight on time, and miraculously my luggage was waiting for me at LHR when I arrived. A great trip with excellent service.",Promoter
Incheon to Chicago business class. This was the best business experience I have had on routes to the US. Check-in at Incheon was fast and efficient and lounge at ICN was immaculate.

In-flight service good, with a notable improvement in the quality of food, i.e., courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp. IFE lagging behind that offered by competitors, with small screens and limited movies. Breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual.

When I tried to explain I didn't have to take that specific route, just somehow I needed to get back home to Orlando. In Beijing, I explained my flight was delayed, they completely ignored me, spoke among each other, and handed me a ticket with a middle seat when I specifically requested an isle seat. I asked where my flight was from JFK, several times, and they just yelled ""booked! Booked! Check JFK""! I get to jfk, didn't know what airline I was flying home from or at what time, and I found they intentionally gave me the worst seat on that flight (fortunately Delta is courteous enough to let you choose your seat, so I was able to fix this).

" Let me start off by complimenting Air China for the good value for money service provided during my flights from Singapore to Beijing and Beijing to New York on 14th December. For the cheap fare I paid, the flying experience wasn't bad. However, the same cannot be said for my return flight from New York to Beijing on 7th January 2018 and Beijing to Singapore on 9th January 2018. My experiences were horrible. 1) I reached JFK Airport at 12.30 pm on 7th January to check in for my flight CA972, which was scheduled to depart at 3.50 pm. The check in process was messy and chaotic. There was no clear organized way and I was only able to check in a few minutes before the departure time. Quite a number of Passengers were still to be checked in after me and I believe that this was the reason the flight got delayed. 2) First, we were told that the flight got delayed for 2 hours. This was acceptable. We were also given 20 dollars worth of meal vouchers, which wasn't bad. Then, for no clear reason, our flight got delayed by almost 12 hours and we only took off at 4 am the next day. We were not given any further meal vouchers after the first one. The delay time was ridiculous. I would surely miss my connecting flight to Singapore. 3) The flight was actually pleasant and I reached Beijing at 8 am local time on the 9th January. The employees at the Air China Transfer Counter changed my ticket to Singapore on another flight 8 hours later. I was tired and asked if they would be offering any hotel. They did. However, instead of directing me to get a 1 day Visa in Beijing, they directed me to international transit. They told me that I would be able to find Air China employees there (inside the transit area) who would help me to with the hotel. All this time, I could hear them cursing in Chinese, muttering under their breath. I am not Chinese (South Asian), but understand the Chinese swear words from my stay in Singapore. When I confronted them about it, the became very rude and started avoiding me. Frustrated, I left for the transit area. Once I got in, I could not find any Air China personnel in the Transit area. I was stuck there tired with no hotel or food or lounge access. I could not go back out to confront those employees. The flight back to Singapore was pleasant. But they forgot to update my Kosher meal preference. I was too frustrated at that point to even respond. It had been 2 days on the road and I just wanted to come back home. So far this is my worst experience ever. I have nothing against the in-flight crews. They were very nice. But the Air China ground staff in Beijing were extremely rude and intentionally unhelpful. I was seduced by their low fares, but I will not be flying Air China ever again.",Detractor
Jeddah from Manchester via Cairo. Flight was delayed by 2hrs. B737-800 aircraft was too small for this busy 5hrs flight. Very uncomfortable seating. Poor inflight entertainment. Food was very bland. Transfer at Cairo was smooth. A330-300 aircraft used for the Cairo to Jeddah section was good but food was again the same. Return journey from Medan to Manchester was just as bad. When I arrived at my allocated seat it was already taken by another passenger. Flight attendants could do with more customer care training. Cairo airport has inadequate passenger facilities.

" London Heathrow to Bangkok in Premium Economy. Check in at LHR T2 very quick and easy. Flight was about 20 minutes late due to the late arrival of the incoming flight due to the re-routing caused by airspace issues over Pakistan. This caused a late arrival in BKK and missed connection there but no fault of EVA Air. Seat was comfortable, I am 1.83m but no issue with legroom in premium economy. Cabin crew service was very efficient and the food was quite good, I chose the grilled chicken with noodles and it was quite tasty and moist. Drinks service is quite minimal, with small plastic cups for the wine, but not really an issue. I found the cabin a little cold for this overnight flight although the blankets provided were quite thick but a little small. Overall a good flight.",Promoter

PRG-ARN-TKU TKU-CPH-OSL-PRG in SAS Go within a single weekend. There's nothing to complain about in terms of seat comfort - be it a small 737-600 or an A320 the comfort level is pretty much the same and quite decent at that. The cheapest fare gets you tea or coffee while the snacks for purchase are rather pricey and all in all not that attractive. The ARN-TKU was on a Braathens-operated Saab 200 turboprop. The ride is definitely bumpier but even here the legroom is above standard. The most cramped aircraft by far is the CRJ900 though that's mainly due to the narrow cabin while the seat pitch remains comfortable. My only major issue was the somewhat misleading information by the crew suggesting that people claim their baggage in Stockholm for customs even though it is checked directly to the destination. This made up for 40 minutes of wasted time at ARN. As a whole however I wouldn't hesitate to fly with SAS again.,Passive
" Las Vegas to Montreal via Toronto. I have upgraded to business class on every flight I have taken on many different airlines and never had service as bad as we had on this flight. We upgraded 24 hours before, as I always do, and once in the plane, all they gave us was a bag of peanuts telling us that we cannot get food since we upgraded at the airport and it's too last minute to provide food (which was wrong). I know the upgrade details mentioned that we might not get the business class meal for free, but why were we not offered it for purchase, as we saw people in coach purchasing that same meal (which was for purchase on their inflight menu). Once we asked, the hostess became very rude and told us well have more drinks! Besides, the seats were way less comfortable than any other airline, especially Air Canada. So be careful when purchasing your tickets if you care at all about comfort because you will not get it, no matter how much you pay on Rouge.",Detractor

"I flew United Airlines from LHR to MCO via IAH in Economy Plus, on their Boeing 787-8. United Airlines Economy Plus product is simply the economy class seat but with an additional 3 or so inches of leg room. The economy plus product is only worth buying if you want that extra room but in my opinion I don't believe there's much difference between that and the economy product. I flew economy back and didn't really find it much different. My wife, son and I are all average height and weight so don't require any extra leg room. The main problem is that the seat is far too thin and as such doesn't provide much support. I know this is a design improvement to lower the weight of the aircraft, but it doesn't help your back on those long flights - LHR to IAH is 10 hours or so. I normally fly business class for work for transatlantic flights (SFO and JFK) around four or five times a year on BA's 747-400 or Virgin's A346 or 747-400 and flying the 787-8 is by far the best craft I've been on. I felt the freshest and the least dehydrated on this craft. In summary, I don't think economy plus is worth the upgrade cost but if you have an extra $150 dollars or so then go for it.",Passive

" Khartoum to Dubai. I have just stepped off a Fky Dubai flight which was delayed from Khartoum to Dubai by over 3 hours. Delay is acceptable - it happens but how an airline deals with the situation is critical. I was traveling alone and was assisting a fellow traveller who was travelling with a baby (3 months) and a 1 year 9 month old toddler who was asleep when we arrived and they had missed a connection flight to Oslo. The mother had handed over her pushchair before boarding the plane at Khartoum and despite knowing that our flight was 3 hrs late and many travellers had transit they were not prepared to deal with tired and anxious passengers. I asked for a pushchair and was ignored by several staff. Staff were rude, insensitive and had an attitude with all the confused passengers. They had no information and when I told them the woman couldn't speak English and I am actually entering Dubai, I was simply told by a manager to â€œjust go into Dubaiâ€! The staff where just as rude as the manager. After holding this sleeping baby for an hr and being delayed over 4 hrs to enter Dubai and go to work, they came with a pushchair that was in the back!! Delays happen but it's not fly Dubai staff have to accept that passengers are unhappy and assist them. This is what customer service is about. I have vowed to never travel with fly Dubai with my children as this experience has shown me that they are insensitive to passengers with Children.",Detractor

I had a great flight (DY 7045) with Norwegian from LGW to Fort Lauderdale (FLL) on Friday 13th February. Perhaps I chose the wrong day as the good flight experience was marred by awful ground handling at Fort Lauderdale. Firstly we had to be bussed from the aircraft to another terminal with no priority for Premium Class passengers rather treated like cattle and pushed on to the bus. No cattle would have been better treated! Usual chaos at US immigration with no control of passengers although I cannot blame Norwegian for that. Worst experience was waiting 2 hours after arrival for the luggage to appear with no explanation no apolgy and no Norwegian ground staff present to offer any indication of when the luggage would be delivered. Again no priority in the luggage delivery for Premium Class passengers just an intermittent free for all delivery. A great flight was ruined by terrible ground handling.,Passive

Not only has this negatively impacted my business, it has also affected the impression that others have of me. Lateness has become an acceptable trend with this airline.

" Together with my wife and my two kids (3 and 10) we were going to Copenhagen for a weekend trip. We booked Ryanair from Stuttgart because the offered price was attractive. I'm flying quite a lot for work and I am used to normal flight practices. However, what Ryanair is doing is just fraudulent and absolutely unacceptable. For the flight to CPH we checked in through the internet, printed our boarding passes at home and everything was ok. In Copenhagen we stayed in an apartment without access to a printer. Also, I didn't know checkin had to be done a minimum of 2 hours in advance through the internet, as this was not mentioned at all on the Print-outs of the e-tickets. Upon arrival at the checkin area, we were informed we had to pay 60 EUR per person because our checkin was not done on time (we arrived there 1h and 50 minutes before flight time), which meant an additional Eur 240 for the 4 of us. We were not the only ones concerned and just next to me was a handicapped couple, which also needed to pay. Such kind of business practices are just unbearable and fraudulent, because this information was not mentioned anywhere. Apart from Ryanair I totally do not understand how airport staff can accept such business behaviour, because at the end it's them who force the people to pay. These people are no Ryanair employees, in fact there is no Ryanair office, nor Ryanair employees in the whole of Scandinavia. Also in Stuttgart airport there are no Ryanair people present at all. I would feel ashamed pushing through such policies on the back of the customers and I do not understand how people can go to work every day under such circumstances, because obviously they have to deal with many unhappy and sometimes angry passengers, who just feel nailed by such business practices. Well, I learned from this experience that I will never fly Ryanair again, neither for work, nor for holidays. And for sure my two kids will never fly Ryanair again either. So they have lost two potential customers immediately and two future potential customers. I honestly hope more and more people will boycott this company so that it disappears from the market.

"  Shanghai to Beijing. Chose this airline as it was cheaper and the timing gave me half a day more in Shanghai before moving on to Beijing. The aircraft type stated during booking was a Boeing 787-9, however, they changed this a few days before the flight to an A330. Luckily I had a point to check my flight booking consistently, as the seat that I selected (33A) was a premium economy seat on the 787, but an economy class seat on the A330- managed to move to seat 32A, which was a premium economy seat. The seat itself was identical to the economy class seat, with the exception of a different colour and generous legroom - I could stretch my legs fully without even touching the seat back in front of me! Before take-off, the cabin crew served drinks to the passengers in premium economy - a welcome service, but perhaps the standard of a premium economy class cabin, given that this was my first time flying premium economy. The flight was delayed-the boarding time was supposed to be 5:25pm, but the aircraft did not even come in until about 5:35pm! In the end, we landed in Beijing 30 minutes late. The cabin crew were quite friendly, giving out drinks quickly and clearing them fast enough. A meal was served on board, but I found it to be rather small compared to other full service carriers. The IFE screen, though touchscreen, was a bit small and the selection was quite limited. However, what I really found weird was the ban on all electronic devices - being used to being able to use smaller PEDs (with communication features turned off, of course) on other airlines, this was a surprise to me.

MSP-JFK-MXP and return 4 days later. Economy comfort. First time doing this route as I prefer going into and out of Linate - Milan but short notice trip forced itinerary. Very surprised and pleased with the 767 leg (JFK- Milan) wider seats and quieter cabin than the A330's used on MSP-AMS. CRJ 9XX on the way out a bit small for a 2.5 hr flight A319 on return bigger but noisy. JFK transfer a bit of a hassle with on-going construction but new terminal is nice improvement. MXP was a pain to exit on return. Overall Delta experience is improving and remains a decent choice from MSP to Europe. I still prefer Linate over Malpensa at least for now.,Promoter
" Chicago to Lviv via Warsaw. We came from Chicago to Warsaw and in Warsaw airport worker said that our carry out bag is too big for a plane, they have full plane, so we need to put it in a trunk. It was weird that only our bag was too big, the plane was half empty (we noticed that after)and our bag could be easily put under the seat. Also in Chicago we didn't have any problems with bag. After we got our bags and arrived home we saw only empty boxes with no bracelet and charm in. It was a gift, and unfortunately not very great. We don't feel sorry about money that we spent. The fact that someone's hand was in our bag is horrible. We are very disappointed of the work of airlines and airports.",Detractor
Flew on an award economy ticket RDU-LHR-RDU a very convenient route if you live in NC/SC or Southern VA. Both flights on time the food edible the service efficient if not enthusiastic the seats cramped and uncomfortable. AA deploys a 767-300 on this route a fine 20th century workhorse but woefully inadequate for the 21st century in passenger comfort and technology - only cabin ceiling monitors for in flight entertainment. The new AA/US combination will need to work hard in the future to match their partner BA and the others competing with them offering US to Europe non stops.,Detractor

Las Vegas to Mexico City with Aeromexico. It was the longest waiting time for me ever - we experienced 6-hour delay and it was the worst communication process from airline to customers in order to inform what was happening and the real delay time. I just receive a message from the airline when we arrived to the airport 2 hours before departing time. We had to go back to the city after checking in and we had no hotel obviously but the airline did not offer anything in compensation for this delay (lunch would be nice at least) and was not clear about the real waiting time.,Detractor
"  Dubai to Toronto via London, and I tried to check-in online. However, this was blocked and upon enquiry to BA's unhelpful Customer Contact centre, I was told it was a â€œrandomâ€ security hold by airport authorities. When I questioned that the supervisor changed the story to one of needing ETA for travel to Canada. When I informed her that could not be the case as I was a dual UK-Canadian citizen, she changed the story to one of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website. Only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my Canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of BA's control. The second joy I had with lovely BA and staff was at Heathrow during transit. As I had a 6-hour layover I elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at T5 arrivals. Upon entering departures, I was stopped by one of BA senior managers who forced me to check in my carry-on luggage (despite it being cleared by BA in Dubai) but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through. Perhaps she is the model random manager BA aspires to for future leadership. In any case, this â€œmanagerâ€ was so eager to check by carry on in, that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check-in agents location. Such is the competency and class of this â€œmanagerâ€ but then again one can expect no less from BA either. Finally, at Toronto, the checked in carry on came half-hour after the already delayed regular checked-in luggage â€“ adding salt to wound. I flew to London from Dubai several times last year on Emirates, and on KLM/Delta/Air France to Toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry-on from any of them. Finally, I called the UK ""Customer Relations"" center from Toronto, but I gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes. They are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too. I wish I could give this rotten airline 0/10, but the minimum is 1/10 and I am happy with that.",Detractor
Business class pax travelling from Perth to Madrid 1st June. Check in smooth and efficient lounge at Perth good. Boarded flight and welcomed by crew.

I got rebooked today for flight again from PHL to LGW. However, my seat was downgraded from Saga premium 6A to economy 9A.

"London to Dubai via Bahrain return on Gulf Air. Upgraded to Business Class on the London to Bahrain leg. Good check in, lounge okay at Heathrow Terminal 4. Comfortable beds with plenty of room in the cabin - only 18 business class seats. Service was good with excellent food and a good choice of quality wines. Cabin staff were very attentive. Only criticism is the IFE. In both classes, it was very mediocre to say the least. Bahrain to Dubai leg was in economy class. Not a seat free in a very cramped aircraft (A321). The only blessing on an awful flight was that it was only 50 minutes. The return leg was in economy class. Fortunately, we got exit row seats with plenty of leg room, but looking around, the A330 economy experience did not look too bad - food was fine, staff friendly enough and plenty of drinks if you asked. Given the price, Gulf Air was not such a bad experience. Would probably use again if better alternatives were at the then same extortionate prices.",Passive

My husband and I each fly over 150,000 miles per year and this was one of the worst flights. I was cold (no blankets to be found, apparently you have to request them) and luckily we had our own headphones as no headphones were passed out. There were no waters given for a five and a half hour flight as on other airlines we fly and the flight attendants only came through for drink requests once before the flight left and once during dinner service, other times I had to request refills of my water.

LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies. Have a good flight if you are considering this airline.,Detractor

"  Singapore to San Francisco via Shanghai with China Eastern Airlines. Got an exit row seat at no charge. Flight was 2 hours late arriving into PVG and missed its takeoff slot, so an extra hour on tarmac. Ground staff were not able to supply any information as to why the flight was late. In fact, there were no ground staff at the gate. My vegetarian meal wasn't available (I had ordered it), but the staff improvised and I ended up with boiled cabbage and rice. I was starving but grateful. The cabin staff brought me an iPad with a roster of vegetarian meal orders to prove that my order wasn't on it, and I was therefore to blame - never mind. At least they offered me food. Plane seemed rather old, no inflight entertainment, no charging and no wi-fi. But it got us to SFO safely. Not the most comfortable experience, but I paid $580 for a round trip from SFO to Singapore, so I recommend China Eastern to anyone on a budget.

" While the overall trip was amazing, many aspects fell short. Upon checking in, I learned that 5 out of 8 passengers in First class had upgraded. As a full fare F passenger, I was disappointed because not only I ended up paying a lot more, but also I'd be in a packed cabin translating to less personal attention by the crew. The difference was full fare F passengers were personally escorted to the lounge and onto the plane. The lounge at LHR was very crowded. I had a reserved table waiting for me at the lounge and I was able to use the shower for free. However, champagne was not complimentary and I had to pay GBP6 per flute if I order one. Boarding was fantastic as I boarded before it began and I was offered champagne right away by the fantastic crew. They had 2 types of champagne on offer and I ended up trying both during boarding. I saw my neighbour had red and white wine - so I assume you can pretty much order whatever drinks you'd like. It was obvious the crew were slightly overwhelmed as 1 crew kept on addressed me by the wrong name on 2 occasions. She was apologetic and I had no problem with it. I received a kit with very mediocre content (worse than the kit I got when traveling GA J a year before). However, upon landing, I was given the proper F kit by the ground staff and I was informed they ran out while in London. This might sound trivial, but I ended up noticing things like these when I was flying First. The service was nothing short of spectacular, crew went above and beyond from preparing a wine tasting session (GA had 6 different wine) to sharing holiday stories. Meals were also good. I found the seat to be very comfortable for lounging and sleeping (a duvet was provided for turn down service). IFE could use more selection on movies and complete seasons of TV shows. Arrival service was another major let down for me. Despite receiving a confirmation prior to the trip that I could use their J lounge for a shower after landing in Jakarta (they could not grant me access to their F lounge which was odd considering they granted passengers access when they have a connecting flight even on non-GA flight), I was disappointed to learn upon landing that I could only use the arrival lounge. It was barely a lounge, it was more of a room with small seating areas for F/J pax to wait for their luggages plus 1 shower stall. They did not have a towel in the shower room and nothing could be done by the clueless staff manning the lounge. Overall, GA's F was a very solid product, but I would not pay full fare to fly on it.",Passive
"Paris to BogotÃ¡, I was curious how the Premium Class is, as some reviews are rather critical. First my agency told me it will cost +400â‚¬ but at least they charged me 600â‚¬ more just for one way. It was great to enter the gate and the aircraft by the ""sky priority"" lane. The first optical impression of the premium class cabin was good, big IFE-screen, fine noise cancelling airphones, reading lamp, space for water etc. The service was fine and better than in standard Economy, the Duck and goose foie gras terrine was like in business, the Salmon fagottini pasta not. I did not taste much of the salmon. I had a long day-flight and for this purpose the Premium Class is a good choice. But I cannot recommend it for sleeping. You have a fixed seat without a real inclination. You just can glide some 10cm more in front of you and thats it. But you have enough legroom. Whilst the Business Class and Economy were almost full, the Premium Class was not sold out and so everybody who wanted had a free seat beneath which of course always is more comfortable. Compared with KLM Comfort Seats its too expensive.",Passive

Comparing the Boeing 777-300 and the A380 models in China Southern, I think the facility isn't enough to protect guests' privacy here. There is not much advantage except the first class is more comfortable than the business class. This time, stewards did not hastily distribute meals for us as usual, instead told us provide meals at any time. The pajamas on the plane is very comfortable, I can see the smile of the flight attendants.

"Return journey with Ethiopian Airlines from Joburg to Mumbai via Addis Ababa on 22nd November. Check in at Joburg was a nightmare, the staff member took more than 45 minutes to check us in.

However, despite repeated reminders to the attendant at the booking counter, this time however we were not provided with a baby cot / aisle seat. My 10 month old daughter was restless almost the whole flight and at times it became very difficult to attend her.

After a 2 hour halt, had a connecting flight to Mumbai from Addis Ababa at 11 pm local time. Again a nightmare, this time in terms of the flight. How can they think of operating a Boeing 737 to Mumbai for a 5 hour flight? Completely cramped flight, no option to even move your hand, forget reclining the seats. Veg Meal was the worse that I have had with any airline. Only plus sign was again they served drinks as often as we wanted. Veg food was an insult, sweet rice and sweet chick pea curry.

The difference is stark and it is hard to reconcile paying the same money for such a different offering. As usual with Qantas on time and uneventful flights with great cabin crew and satisfactory service offerings. The bottom line is that 31 inches in international economy is simply not competitive for a full service carrier.

And sure enough, most people on our flight had one carry on bag (same size or bigger than ours) and a briefcase, backpack, handbag that fits under the seat in front of you. I guess they were able to check in online and bypass the nasty ground staff. For some reason, Norwegian wouldn't let us check in online, maybe because we have a connection to a US flight. The thing that was also troubling is that Norwegian uses the same ground services company for luggage, as the one that lost our suitcase several days prior. I have never had such a problem on other European airlines, nor on US airlines. Lastly, we are connecting onto a flight to The US and booked the Premium cabin (Norwegian's discount business). However they still nickel and dimed us on the connecting flight, charging for water. Lastly, why do they have their checkin at Terminal D, but then make you walk to the opposite side of terminal A for their gates at SXF, and then make you take a bus to the plane? When changing planes at LGW, they tell you you have to be at the gate 1:20 before the flight time. This is also ridiculous. It doesn't take that long to board an airplane.",Detractor
I read some poor reviews prior to my flight 19.12.12 and was worried about travelling with 3 young children. However on the 12 hour flight LX038 from Zurich to San Francisco our family was looked after really well. The cabin crew were polite and attentive checking on us to make sure we were ok from time to time. The plane was fairly new clean the food was ok and the entertainment (though I rarely get to view) was good. Overall it was one of the best economy flight experiences I have had.,Promoter
Flew out to Majorca from East Midlands on 24th May returned on 7th June to East Midlands flight should have left on 24th May at 11.35 departed at 12.05 due to I think a seating problem. Seems 2 sets of people had been allocated same seats I think the problem could have been solved earlier as 2 people boarded flight some 20/25 mins. After flight should have left. We had a great flight home arrived a little earlier that was spoiled by having to walk 300/400 yards to passport control in pouring rain. Everyone was sopping wet by the time we got there very shoddy service at East Midlands.,Passive
BLQ-CDG and return. Very quick flight great check-in both way and helpful desk. Both flights were on time operated with A319 not really tidy and clean.

I flew from Cape Town to Johannesburg and from Johannesburg to Sao Paulo. I fly this route at least 2 times per year with South African Airways. What I always find strange is that when you board the plane the crew is all in the back shouting loudly and laughing. They do not come out to the cabin to welcome you on board - this happens in most airlines. All you hear is them speaking loudly to each other and laughing in the back. Is this the South African welcome? South African Airways prides itself on being the best airline in Africa - but is there really any competition? The service is very poor. I get the feeling that half of the crew really dislikes their job. We had one very rude flight attendant who seemed annoyed when you went to the back of the plane to ask for water or use the toilets. The entertainment of the flight did not work for the first few hours. The food is ok but normally they run out quickly of one of the choices. There were no snacks served between meals. The toilets and the plane were pretty dirty and smelly. Unfortunately SAA is the only option from Brazil to South Africa.,Detractor
The relatively short commute between Durango CO and Cleveland OH was the worst trip I have experienced. I have never had any trip since the inception of Denver International Airport that has gone without an aircraft maintenance problem. This recent trip held me hostage on a small aircraft and at the airport for 8 hours. I have never seen such an appalling record of mechanical breakdowns as I've seen with aircraft at Denver's airport. Both the departure and return trips were plagued with mechanical problems. The return trip was on board an aircraft meant for short duration flights of less than 1 hour and was used for a trip spanning over 3 hours. When we were supposed to circle the airport for a short period of time we had to divert to Cheyenne WY to refuel. The plane was too small to carry the necessary amount of fuel. As a result I missed my connection and waited 7 hours before taking off to my final destination. On the outbound trip we had to return to DIA due to a mechanical failure of an engine. We had already flown 45 minutes and instead of landing in an airport we were close to we had to fly back 45 minutes wait for another plane and take off in the middle of the night. We landed at 12.45 am. I have flown from different cities (Manhattan KS and Albuquerque NM) to Alaska three times and not once did I experience any problems with aircraft. The main difference was that none of these trips included United Airlines and Denver International Airport.,Detractor
 Las Vegas to Kansas City. This airline is terrible! We had the worst experience ever with them! Coming home from Vegas and went to check in for flight and find out they cancelled our flight. We waited an hour for them to start calling us up! When we got up there she told us we should have an email. They rerouted us through Delta and we had to fly to Atlanta and have a 3 hour lay over and then fly back to KC! She also told us we would get refunded for any charges for the flight that got cancelled. I had purchased a checked bag (50$) and fast track check in (14$). Today I called to find out when my refund was coming and they informed me they could not refund my money! That I should of gotten the refund while I was there! Then proceeded to tell me the only thing I could do is go to Vegas and ask for my money back or file a complaint online! They basically stole 64$ of my money because of their own mistakes! I will never use this airline again!,Detractor

" Great daytime flight from Shanghai to Oslo via Moscow SVO. Despite some apprehension from other reviews regarding bags going missing at SVO transfer, everybody and their bags arrived earlier than scheduled at the final destination. Transfer from SVO Term D to E was a quick walk and uneventful. A well supplied lounge at Term E was quiet and relaxed during the short transit time. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful with perfect English language skills and the meals above average, with four main course options on offer and each was tops. Plenty of wine/spirits were available during meals and the flight generally. IFE was well stocked and adequate for a 10 hour flight. The lie-flat beds were not tested on this occasion.",Promoter
"  New York JFK to Delhi via London and Kuwait. Flight delay at JFK by about 45 minutes, no announcements at airport so advised to stay close to gates. I had read reviews for poor service but the 24 year old A340 was ok condition. Old seats with non working monitors but seat space is good. Staff good at services. I had booked AVML so special meal was served. JFK-LHR sector had one set of crew. Deplaned at LHR, went through whole terminal and screening to board same aircraft after 1 hour. The new crew was attentive and service was good. Again no inflight entertainment and no alcohol as per Kuwait airways policy. Both sectors were almost 6-7 hours long so carry your Ipad, music with you. At Kuwait stopover of 3 hours, airport is crowded and almost no place to sit. No wifi. Again a long boarding queue, another A340 similar 24 year old aircraft without entertainment system. Again crew was helpful but passengers were noisy. The only reason for flying Kuwait Airways was cheap fare. If you are happy going from point A to B in old aircraft but with good service, then go for it.

"  Me and my wife had a bad experience with Jetblue's staff on a flight to Cancun from Ft Lauderdale. Our 21 month old toddler was crying a lot with no clear reasons why. My wife and I were trying our best to calm her down. The air hostess comes over and says that we need to calm her down because we were disturbing other passengers! Of course we don't want our baby to be crying and do NOT want her to be distressed. We were trying our best to soothe her down but nothing was helping. This was totally unexpected. When the airline was contacted, they did apologize, but at the same time, they reiterated that the air hostess did not do anything wrong.

"  San Francisco to Osaka via Shanghai. Flying with China Eastern was the worst airline experience I've ever had. On my way back to the United States from Japan, I was told at check-in that although my reservation was supposed to be Osaka > Kunming > San Francisco, that I would actually be stopping in Shanghai for a quick plane change before going to Kunming. I asked them if I needed a 3rd boarding pass for that in-between time or if they could provide an itinerary with the times and they said it would be unnecessary because it wasn't a full layover and staff would help us once we were in Shanghai. When I got to Shanghai, we had to go through Chinese customs. All of us with this route were taken together by staff. However, I was the only non-Chinese citizen and was held back. They said they needed my new boarding pass or an itinerary to let me through. I went to the China Eastern desk in Shanghai to see if they would provide this, they refused, so I went back to customs. Basically I kept being sent back and forth between customs and the China Eastern desk for hours that I eventually got left by staff and all the other passengers were taken to Kunming and I was left stranded in Shanghai with no clue what to do. After about 6 hours of this they finally re-booked me on a direct flight back to San Francisco from Shanghai. But the staff was extremely rude and yelled at me for not forcing my way through customs (although all they needed to do was print my itinerary for me and it wouldn't have been a problem). After being re-booked I was taken to another area to wait for another hour for a shuttle to take me to a hotel (it was about 1am at this point). The shuttle finally came and it was an unmarked van driven by two casually dressed men. I waited in the shuttle for an hour with no update about where we were going and when we were leaving. Eventually other passengers started being loaded in. They filled up the van completely, with people standing in corners (and once again, this is just a normal van, not a bus or anything meant to be stood inside of). We got to the hotel and the hotel told us that we were going to have to share rooms with other passengers. Luckily there were some Chinese people in the group who knew they were just trying to scam us and talked the hotel staff into giving us our own rooms. Therefore, it's clear what sort of sketchy hotel China Eastern had chosen for us. Luckily the next morning I was able to get out on my new flight but only after about 8 hours of being mistreated by their staff. I will never fly them again no matter how cheap and would never suggest anyone else do either.",Detractor

As I went to drop my bag at the check-in desk, a barrier was lower, so I took a shortcut and stepped over it. Straight after staff come up to me and with a intimidating attitude asked me: is everything ok?! At first I didn't realise, but then I told me in that I should not step over the barrier as a matter of security. Honestly I felt very embarrassed, so I apologies. Few seconds after I saw some older guy doing it, but staff looked away. Then another guy did it in front of him, and staff smiled away. So I asked staff why it was ok for some people to do it and not for me? It was then become aggressive and rude, so I decide to let the argument go. He should be fair with all, no just pick arguments with foreigners so that he can feel good and embarrassing customer in front of all. I hope Indigo can address this with staff and provide him with a customer service training. He is the face of Indigo when people arrive at the airport, and people like him can ruin the reputation of Indigo. Then on the flight they didn't have changed for cash payments and instead wanted me to buy more things.

They said the system was down and they were going to try and book us all flights on other planes because apparently the one plane Spirit owned in Seattle was having maintenance issues (mind you I had to ask three different attendants before anybody told me this).

Only one person in our party of four got a re-booked flight (we had all purchased our tickets together) and it left Seattle at 7 pm that night, had a six hour lay over in Oakland and then arrived in LAX at 7 am the next day - we would have missed our reservation and only one of us would have arrived. Our party ended up driving down to Portland where we got a flight by 4 pm on Alaska to LAX.

" Terrible. This is the cheapest airline I've ever flown with and they want to charge you for everything and at an outrageous price! To check in one bag with Frontier was $45.

We know you can afford to give everyone a free drink and some crackers and no charge for it. I've never been on an airline where they charged for all items and was actually in shock. Lastly, the seats do not adjust at all. You want to lean back a little and take a nap? Not going to happen! I actually fell asleep sitting up and my head landed on the shoulder of the man sitting next to me so my fiancÃ© had to move my head onto his shoulder. The seats were hard and covered by plastic/leather material and not cloth so that just added to the uncomfortable part, also made me cold! Frontier is an airline I will never fly on again.

"Heathrow to Bangkok with British Airways. Fast check-in by friendly staff at LHR. The Galleries lounge was as always were busy but seats were comfortable and the food ok. Boarding started approx. 50 min before departure with boarding through L2. Unlike most of the Middle Eastern airlines we were just pointed in the general direction of our seats rather than shown to them. Aircraft was an older 777-200 in a 3 cabin configuration and the age was showing and while generally clean the trimming was coming apart, the IFE screens were small and the seats felt a bit cramped. Very much like Virgin Atlantic's Upper Class seat, these were great for sitting normally or fully flat but everything in between was a struggle. And the ying-yang seat configuration is akward to say the least but the centre seats are great if you travel as a couple. Welcome drinks were eventually served and we took off only slightly delayed. Dinner was painfully slow and it was a good 3 hours after take off before dinner was finished. Starter and dessert were ok, but the entree was far too overcooked for my taste. Also there is no dine on demand facility, you eat what you are given when it suits the crew. The crew were friendly but painfully slow. It also took more than an hour after dinner before the cabin lights were fully dimmed. Breakfast was served 2 hours before landing and the crew were transformed. It was a quick and efficient service, a shame it took them 9 hours to get to that point. Breakfast was not great but edible. We landed at Bangkok on time but no fast track cards for immigration were given. Bags arrived on the belt only minutes after we had passed through immigration. It is clear that BA have been cutting costs in their premium cabin and it shows in spades when compared to the Middle Eastern 3, the Asian airlines and even the US airlines. They could benefit from cutting the very generous bagage allowance and use the money saved on fuel on getting a new hard product (seats and cabins) and improving their soft product (food, service, etc), especially given their current price point.

I have flown Ethiopian Airlines 3 times in the last 4 months (DC to various countries in East Africa via Addis). I love that the airline has a direct flight to East Africa but I am getting tired of a few things that will likely make me use other airlines that pass through Europe. The tickets are good value for money but the more you fly it the things it doesn't do well start to grate on you. The food! Like someone else said it's bad. They have maybe 3 entrees on rotation (a curry chicken seems to be the most common) and it gets old fast especially if you connect on another flight and are served the same entree you ate a few hours ago. The desserts are often a soapy flavored mousse. The middle of the night snack is the worst- it is all carbs and bad! A muffin or croissant a white bread roll and a fruit cup. Essentially it's cheap and not good quality (in terms of airline food quality). Also they don't serve enough water throughout the 12-16 hour flight especially because you can't bring on your own water at the Addis airport unlike you can in the US. That makes for a long thirsty flight. I just got off a flight today where one of the bathrooms was completely out of commission and another had a sink that didn't drain. That's bad and I am not convince that these things get fixed between flights. If you need a cheap flight to Africa go for it but if you are like me and traveling for work it gets old very quickly. I want to save my NGO money and so Ethiopian Airlines is an economical option but honesty not sure that I can tolerate it much more. Also between November an February they did not change the films which meant that my 2nd round trip was a long flight without entertainment. That being said the system is good when there are programs and films you want to watch.,Passive
Frankfurt to Toronto. Positive: Customer service was efficient and courteous spacious clean and comfortable aircraft. Negatives: Horrible food - absolutely atrocious - We were served a hot meal shortly after departure and because the flight was booked they ran out of different meal options so by the time they served the back of the cabin not only was the food cold but we were not given any meal options. Apparently there was a chicken dish available but we were served a disgusting pasta Bolognese dish. The roll was stale and the side was some form of potatoes which had been reconstituted from potato flakes. Apparently others on the flight had similar issues with the chicken dish which tasted like rubber and a salad which had wilted. It was extremely disappointing and I did not eat any of it. Later on we were served Air Canada's 'signature' tortilla/wrap by Monty's which also tasted horrible and is worse than a pizza pocket. The meals and food in general were terrible and I pretty much went the entire flight without eating anything. I hope that Air Canada revamps their meals and offer healthier options instead of meals that look and taste worse than 'TV dinners' or those you would get from a can. I understand that many individuals have varying dietary requirements and allergies but perhaps Air Canada should invest in a dietician or nutritional consultant to encourage healthy eating on the go while meeting the needs of their customers.,Passive
" Barcelona to Cologne. I have never seen such a horrible airline before. At first you see that, the price of fly is unbelievable cheap. After booking or at the airport, you will be forced to pay around double due to their internal rules. On the other hand, the seats are horrible and you get null service either in airport or by the fly. Farther more, the staffs of the airline at the airport (in Barcelona) were very rude.",Detractor
Newark to Hong Kong in Economy Plus. The flight left early and arrived late which made for a 16.5 hour flight. It was a very smooth flight and the fasten seatbelt sign was turned off 2 hours after take-off. I asked for a glass of red wine and was told that United began charging $7.99 a glass on flights across the Pacific Ocean on Jan 1 2014. No hot towels were provided. The meal came with plastic tableware. The individual in-flight entertainment worked well on the 777-200. 2 hours before landing there were a couple of bumps and the fasten seatbelt sign was on for the remaining 2 hours of the flight. On a 16 hour flight it is nice to use the toilet to freshen up before landing. No toothbrush or socks were provided. I purchased the more expensive W ticket because I had an upgrade but the business/first section was full two weeks before departure.,Detractor
Flew from USA to Europe round-trip 4 flights as connection through Lisbon. First flight the Atlantic portion they ran out of soap in the bathroom and the last hours of the flight some toilets not working/flushing. One of our seats was broken and would recline the adjacent passenger's screen was not working so he would look across the aisle at another screen. We were about 2 hours delayed so while we didn't miss our connections others on board did. The return flight better except again no soap in the bathroom. The entertainment on the screen was terrible unless you consider one war movie and the following movie Mulan good choices for an 8 hour flight. The flight left timely although the other passengers (about 5) we spoke to said their other flights were late. The food was fair/good. Would avoid this airline for future travels.,Detractor
"  I was so excited to be flying Cathay Pacific and in Premium Economy flying from Hong Kong to London. It was a very surprising and disappointing experience, one I won't be repeating. 1) Food - awful - I had gluten free meal and the same exact meal was served twice - once at the beginning and again for breakfast. It was pretty inedible the first time. There is so much great gluten free food out there, poor job Cathay. 2) Entertainment - wow, compared to flying Qantas the leg prior Cathay was again way down the list. Hopeless selection that was hard to sort out. Even the TV screen wasn't easy to use. It just felt all over a cheap airline that skimped. I was so surprised as I'd heard Cathay were good.",Detractor
 Sydney to Houston via Dallas. First time flying Qantas after many years. Have cancelled my Qantas frequent flyer membership. Will never fly again. Nor will I be bothering to accrue any status. What sort of airline issues status credits that expire after 3 days. Qantas does. Nice way to keep people on lower tier status. Flight delayed leaving and arrived late. Missed the connection although one of my bags went on the plane I was supposed to be on. How does that work when you have to retrieve your bag on arrival in Dallas. I would not recommend American Airline eithers. They offer first class tickets and no lounge access. Or they offer lounge access but no complimentary drinks. Love it when an airline suspends drinks service due to turbulence that never eventuates. I feel for Qantas it must be difficult having to compete with airlines that offer customer service and modern planes. A380 business seats should have been replaced years ago.

The crew used the ""dine as you like"" as an excuse to never come around and check if passengers needed anything. When walking down the aisle, the attendants made sure to avoid eye contact.

Dubai - Hong Kong - Sydney. I have flown this route with Cathay now 3 times in the last 5 months in the new business class. It takes me an extra six odd hours on this route with the stop over rather than with Qantas direct however that's where the negatives stop. Considering the price which is consistently 2000 dollars less expensive return and what I regard as a better product than QF (seats all have aisle access much more privacy etc) it's a no brainer. Cathay every time as the saving/product far out weighs the extra travel time. The inflight service food and all round package has for me Has been consistently excellent as well.

The flight crew for our flights were great and plane interiors were generally clean - it is good to break-up a flight to Europe with a stop for about an hour mid-way, especially when you're traveling with children. However, on the negative end, the planes are too narrow for such long flights, the new style seats are uncomfortable and the armrests don't rise between many seats which is a complete failure of set-up given people like to cozy with family members when traveling or take advantage of an empty seat. You also have to pay for meals in economy class (which is actually not too bad tasting) unless you have Saga points you've accumulated from a prior flight.

" New York to Berlin. The boarding was simple, yet late. The small Lufthansa lounge at New York's JFK Terminal 1 was very empty, the selection average, a mixture of cold and hot food and drinks. 10 min late, the boarding commenced. First to enter the plane are business and first class passengers. Greeted by a very lovely flight attendeant, I got served an orange juice. Soon after takeoff, I got nuts and another cold drink. The selection on the menu was as expected for a 7 hour flight: one main meal and 1.5 hours before arrival, a small breakfast. The vegetarian option was excellent, the pasta cooked well. After the food service, the lights were dimmed. I tried my seat functions, pretty standard seat for business class. Yet I was happy about the lie flat seat. The entertainment system worked well, the selection of movies was quite impressive! The only downside to the entertainment options I found was WiFi connectivity. It did not connect for 2/3 devices of mine. Also, the price of WiFi is very high considering I flew in Business class. Some airlines offer this service for free. After a long sleep, a flight attended woke me up and asked to serve me breakfast. This was a much more simple meal, all on one tray. Then I arrived in Berlin.

Ryanair's recent charm offensive seems to have gone in reverse given the way seats are arbitrarily allocated at check in, unless you pay to choose your own. My wife and I were given middle seats in two different rows whilst both the seats adjacent to us were unoccupied. Bizarre!! This situation seemed to apply to many other families resulting in a shambles as many passengers attempted to swop seats in an attempt to sit together.

"Overall a good value for money experience with EasyJet. Was flying from Luton Airport to Nice on a Sunday morning. Upon arrival at the airport, as check in now happens online it was easy to just queue up and drop the bags off at the bag drop desks. Though it's not favourable having so many flights queueing up for around 8 desks the queues were not that bad and the airline were beginning to open more desks. Worst thing about this bag drop system is that those running late don't have an individual desk so have to queue up for a while or use flight closures. The next step of the journey involving the airline was boarding. This happened efficiently and despite the flight being full speedy boarding wasn't needed as overhead locker space was easily avaliable when on board. The cabin crew (4) were helpful, friendly and very presentable. The leg room and seat comfort was as expected. As only a short flight there was no need to purchase any snacks or drinks but as with most airlines items were a touch pricey but there was a decent selection. Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes leaving Luton due to a wait for a take off slot from ATC this delay did seem longer as the aircraft was boarded by 0650 and didn't take off till 0750. Not expected but would of been nice to have screens to follow the route and the captain/first officer gave very little updates. Despite the delay leaving due to a tail wind we did only arrive 15 minutes late. Baggage was delivered in Nice T2 around 15 minutes after disembarking the aircraft which was very speedy. Good experience with EasyJet would advise booking early for cheaper flights but if your able to be flexible that also helps.

We got to the Dallas airport more than 4 hours before the scheduled flight, but ended up waiting in a line of several hundred people for almost 6 hours before the WOW staff even bothered to show up at their check in desk. Apparently, there were about 3 plane-loads of people, and only 1 small plane, so they made a randomized list of who was going to get to fly that day, and we were ""lucky"" enough to be on it. Eventually, about 8 hours after the flight had ben scheduled to leave, we finally boarded the plane. Everyone on the plane had connections to somewhere in Europe, and it was pretty obvious that all of us would be missing those connections being so late. We were all worried and asked about what would happen. We were told that we would be ""taken care of"" once we got to Iceland, but instead, no one was there. Not a single WOW employee was in the airport who could help us. They did absolutely nothing to help anyone, basically stranding all of us in Iceland. Everything through WOW was booked for days, and we waited in lines for hours hoping for help, but eventually we had to book another flight ourselves through a different airline to get out of Iceland, costing me more than $1300 just to get to a destination I had already paid to get to through WOW. They had absolutely zero concern for helping anyone and basically canceled our flight after bringing us half way and into a foreign county. It was a horrible experience, and even though I was told I would receive a refund for the flight that they did not provide, I have still not received it more than 2 weeks later. Although I was lucky enough to get out of Iceland that day, I believe that most people did not. I remember leaving the line at the unhelpful service desk to look for other flights and seeing a line of a couple hundred people, including families and small children, sitting on the concrete floor waiting and hoping for Wow air to do something. I don't have a problem with cheap airlines and I understand that sometimes unforeseeable things happen that cause problems and delays. But the way that a company handles problems matters. I have flown many times with many different airlines, and I have never had an experience as terrible as this one. If you have a week to spare, no plans made ahead of time, a lot of extra cash, and you don't mind being stuck in an airport for days at a time, then go ahead - book a flight with Wow. Otherwise, you may want to look somewhere else. I will certainly never be lured into flying with this company ever again.",Detractor
"  Manila to Gatwick via Hong Kong. I checked in quickly and straight to the lounge for a bite to eat. Boarding was efficient and quick. I settle in my seat 17A, pick up the TV control and realise it is my favourite A350. Flight, stewardess, food is very good. Landed on time. At HK another quick trip to the lounge and then proceeded to board. Flight was full, took a little while to board. I had a quick bite to eat and fell asleep for 9 hours, that is how good this A350 is, landed on time.",Promoter
"I flew direct from Birmingham to Delhi and return with Air India recently in Business Class on a Boeing 787. The flights were timely, the cabin was spacious and the cabin crew worked very hard to make everyone as comfortable as possible. Although perhaps without some of the finesse and presentation of other airlines, the food was fine. I also found the entertainment system perfectly acceptable. Most important, the outward flight was only 7 hrs 50 mins. I have travelled to India with a range of airlines - some direct and some via middle-eastern hubs. Taking all factors into consideration (duration of flight, convenience of travel to airport, space in the cabin, waiting times for transfer flights and value for money) I would travel with this airline by choice on my next trip to India.",Passive
" Dublin to Frankfurt in business class. My experience was mixed, and certainly not what I would have expected from a five-star airline. Check-in in Dublin and the lounge in terminal 1 were fine. Boarding is where problems occurred. The plane arrived late from Frankfurt. This can happen and is not a big deal. We left and arrived about 30 minutes late. I would have expected the ground crew to offer some information and explanation to the lined-up passengers. This did not happen. We were just left to stand in line for 30 minutes. Part of that time was spent uncomfortably in the jet bridge. When I politely asked a member of the ground crew to explain what was happening, I was rebuked for my impertinence. Even stranger, during the flight there was no mention of the delay, as though this were perfectly normal. Service on board was acceptable. The food was quite nice, but it was served hastily, with little attention to detail. For example, I was almost finished with my food when drinks arrived.",Passive

"You know when American Airlines come on the intercom and say we know you have a choice and thank you for choosing them? Please don't choose them. We were flying first class from Denver to St. Thomas via Miami. The plane arrived late to Denver from Dallas due to mechanical issues, which made our connection to St. Thomas very close. When the pilot made up some time we had hopes of making the connection, however when we landed, our gate was not ready and we sat on the tarmac for the 20 minutes. There were at least 12 of us on that flight that missed the plane, and we missed it because the connecting flight left early. The staff for AA were not helpful at all, and would not answer any questions. They were politely rude. They gave us a certificate for an airport hotel, and did not get us our luggage. The next day we were placed on another plane, but not in first class, but in coach. We lost our one night stay at our hotel and because it was 6 hours from the time we would have checked in, they charged us for it. Then we were told that we have to ask for the refund from AA (e.g. lets not make it simple for the customer, lets make it harder for them). Well I just got my refund and guess what, it is only $98.35 each. Does that make up the difference in first class and coach? They have no way to challenge a refund or even to talk to someone. (again, lets make it hard on the customer). You have a choice. Don't choose American Airlines. I know that I won't if I have any other option.",Detractor
"Flight and crew great, the problems came when we had to deal with the Orlando check in staff and customer complaints in uk. Total nightmare and they just did not care at all. Our seats were booked 3 months in advance as we had a small baby with us. When arriving at Orlando airport to return home the check in agent changed our seats to mid row and no bassinets. We noticed before going through security and returned to advise to get our seats that we had booked back. This turned into 2 hours of sheer hell with the staff (including airport manager) while my baby screamed the place down hungry, as we could not go through security until they had rectified the problem. The staff were rude and arrogant and refused to admit they had messed up and refused to change our seats back as they had seated someone else there who had no baby. Even though these seats are reserved for people with babies due to the bassinet availability. Eventually it was changed back after so much stress and hassle. On returning we complained and 3 times we got the answer yes it was our fault we are sorry but we can't give anything to say sorry for our behaviour. Eventually after another complaint they agreed to 3000 avios and Â£25 voucher. I won't be flying with British Airways again as they are so bad in customer relations and check in agents leave a lot to be desired.",Detractor
"  After reading reviews I thought, could it be that bad for just a short European flight? Well, I regret ever spending my well-collected miles for a flight with them. Number one problem? Communication. Departing from Amsterdam with a delay a little less than 1 hour (which is doable) because of what? We will never know. No apologies were given. The good thing is that Amsterdam airport has a good mobile app and provides a lot of information so you always know upfront that your flight is delayed and gives opportunities to adjust plans. All set, finally in the plane. After a while you would expect some kind of service, maybe a drink, a small bite. Well, this is not to be expected with Air Europa. I know it was a 'short' flight but KLM for example always offers a drink, sandwich and a muffin. I ended up paying for a can of sparkling water plus potato chips which then was being charged as separate items since the crew don't remember the package deals. After a calm flight we arrived at Madrid airport, too late of course and I had just about 30 minutes to change gates. Once at the correct gate, everybody was already in line since boarding was about to start at that hour. Nothing happened for 2 hours. No announcement, no information, nothing. Finally the boarding started after 1 crew member was being dropped off by a bus just 10 minutes before, making it look like we were all waiting 2 hours for this lady to arrive. Once in the plane, the captain actually spoke to us and informed us they were having a technical error which has been fully resolved now and we could fly safely to Barcelona. OK, all good, so why were we still stuck with toilets closed, inside the plane for another hour? Everybody was hot, thirsty, in need of a pee etc, passengers were getting angry. During take-off the pilot flew straight into a thunderstorm, the turbulence wasn't very helpful. Traffic control 'forgot' to change the route? Once in the air, again no gestures.",Detractor
" Mumbai to Hong Kong via Delhi. I arrived 10 mins after the boarding started, and was told to queue in line to board despite being a business class passenger. Thankfully another member of staff acknowledged my business class status and allowed me to board first. Due to technical reasons the flight was delayed by 45 minutes after boarding was completed. Staff were really nice looked after the people in business class and offered drinks and food. After take off, food was served and the food was really tasty. Only thing that bothered me was that Air India doesn't serve alcohol in the domestic sector. Layover in Delhi was good and efficient, and soon we were ready for take off. Crew took our meal choices and preferred drinks after take of. This sector they had alcohol. Decided to skip the late night dinner and just had a glass of champagne and got a nice sleep of 4 hours. Overall a good airline and would recommend.",Promoter

Dubai to Vienna / Boeing 767 in new business class. Seats are comfortable with enough privacy. Maybe for some travellers a bit narrow as the armrests and consoles are quite high. Cabin staff was ok - could have been friendlier. Food was a midnight snack (had chicken tikka) which was ok. Breakfast was eggs with toast yoghurt and fruit. Was very good and freshly cooked by the chef on board. Cabin was clean. Toilets without amenities (no hand lotion or eau de toilette). Lounge service in Dubai ok with good choice of food (hot and cold). Overall good experience but crew could have done more to make it memorable.,Passive

As a family of four with children ages 7 and 11 we had to sit in 3 different locations both on our flight to Florida and our return trip. This was unacceptable and staff simply shrugged and said there was nothing they could do about it.

  London to Chennai via Bahrain. The fare was very cheap compared to other airlines. The aircraft are of an average standard and quite old. Inflight entertainment is very bad and boring. Staff are pleasant and accommodating. Food is also of average standard. The biggest issue with Gulf Air is the punctuality. I have been checking some of the flights since I booked my ticket and on several occasions the LHR bound flight had been delayed by more that 2 hours. The outbound flight was uneventful however the inbound flight from Chennai to Bahrain was delayed by 1 hour and even more frustrating to find that the Bahrain - London flight was delayed by 2 hours. Not very pleasant when having to wait for another 2 hours on top of a long 3 hour wait in a very small airport.,Detractor
JFK to Bangladesh. Flight from JFK to Abu Dhabi was acceptable. The crew were helpful especially since we were traveling with a 5 month old. Check in was a breeze the crew were great helping us take turns so that both me and my wife could have our meals while the other one kept the baby. The food was below par. The next leg of the flight from Abu Dhabi to Dhaka was deplorable. First of all checking in was annoying. Another thing that stuck out to me was yes they had a lot of multi-lingual crew members but if you are headed to Bangladesh it probably would help if someone inflight spoke Bengali. On our way back check in was again easy and that's the only good thing that I can say about our return flight. Inflight service was horrible on both legs of the flight. We were flying on Jet Airways not an Etihad carrier and the crew did not know the first thing about customer service. On the longer portion of the flight from Abu Dhabi to JFK after the first two hours of the flight all the crew had vanished and the only way you would see them is if someone rang the attendant bell at their seat. Overall I was very disappointed with the service.,Detractor
" Awful, terrible airline. I fly 1-3 times per month, using a variety of airlines, and Frontier is the most unprofessional, and unconcerned that they're screwing up regularly. It is not worth it to just to save a few bucks. They are cheap for a reason, and from many experiences, I can almost assure that you'll be disappointed. Again, this is based on my experiences from many different flights I've taken with Frontier (and comparing to many other airlines I fly with regularly).",Detractor
" Amsterdam to London. Service Ryanair wouldn't tolerate but with premium prices. Every two years or so I fly with BA, and every two years I am reminded just why I don't normally fly with them. Whilst not as bad as my previous experience (which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to Milan and left me Â£Â£Â£ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived, an no, they wouldn't refund me) we were still delayed. All the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things. BA? Didn't show the delay until we should have been boarding. Get to the gate with my shopping (what else are you to do during a delay?) and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put one of my bags in the hold. Even Ryanair allows a bag of duty free on. It would obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that wasn't allowed. Once we were on board the reason became clear, just like easyJet, Ryanair and many of the other budget airlines, BA doesn't include a checked bag, meaning that all the hand luggage won't fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your bag. So not only was the flight delayed, but I now had to wait for a suitcase. Once we arrived at Gatwick everything went smoothly, I managed to catch the last train to my destination (unlike the previous time I'd flown with them). Additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers. Do not fly BA, save your money and go with a budget airline. The colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier.",Detractor
"Ticket prices excellent for last minute. I found the Norwegian Boeing 787 spacious, clean and very comfortable. The cabin staff were friendly and professional. For those of you that have never flown Norwegian longhaul take note, when you book on their website it gives you a choice to order a meal, it is a low-cost longhaul carrier. I witnessed several complaints onboard but the website clearly states several times you must pre-order if you want a meal. For a low cost longhaul carrier Norwegian have really exceeded my expectations. Good inflight entertainment, good attitude of staff. The only request I have is to introduce wifi on the 787, because this product is great but with wifi on longhaul you will put legacy carriers to even more shame. Would use again and recommend.",Promoter

This time it's a LAX-TPE round trip in its Boeing 777 business class. The seat is a 1-2-1 herringbone configuration that provides individual isle access with good privacy. The food tasted fresh, presentation was great. After a nice sleep, I got hungry in midflight, so I asked for some instant noodle. I was expecting it in a Styrofoam cup or bowl. On the return trip, in midflight I asked for some snacks and coffee. Again it was just wonderful Once the meal service was over and the lights went off, little twinkle stars show up on the ceiling. It's a nice touch. My only complaint is the monitor 15.6"" size is smaller compared to some airlines. I didn't watch too many movies because I had nice sleep in both trips.",Promoter

B777 was great - I'm 6ft 4in so I asked for bulkhead seats. I ordered a special meal and it was ready for all four sections of my journey. LHR-DXB portion all good (B747). On the way back DXB-LHR was great (B777) - I took the 3.20pm outbound flight right after my business was completed (as opposed to taking those 1-2am flights that are offered by other air carriers).

"Ryanair is without a doubt the worst airline I have had the misfortune of flying with. We got to the airport at East Midlands in plenty of time and went to Ryanair check in desks, which took up a good third of all airport check ins.

After 2 hours stood in a queue we got to the front of the queue and again another porter came this time trying to book a disabled woman on in front of us - the woman had walked down with her husband and was sat on a chair smiling. I said to porter what are you doing? He replied booking them on! I'm stood on walking sticks and had been waiting 2 hours. So we had 15 mins left for food and toilets before boarding. The planes have no legroom, the organisation is rubbish and staff don't care less. I will never fly with them again.

The first flight, from Pisa, was quick and easy, leaving on time, with respectful crew and beverages. No entertainment options on this flight because it is only a quick regional 1-hour flight. Had 1:25 minutes to catch the long international flight. The A340-600 that was used for the 9-hour flight was splendid. The seats were comfortable, as I was seated in 45k, which is the second row of economy. Inflight Entertainment (IFE) worked great, with the touchscreen functionality being as smooth as any tablet, unlike most planes. Very good selection of movies, and TV shows and games were also available. Food was great, giving plentiful food that left me satisfied during the entire voyage. We arrived in Chicago 10 minutes in advance, even though we left 10 minutes behind schedule. Deplaning was as efficient as boarding.

The entire crew were excellent and you could tell that service was a priority for them. The aircraft was immaculate and new, flight was on time, and my bags were delivered quickly. This was my fourth flight with China Southern as I had flown to Phuket from Vancouver via Guangzhou in February and this was my return flight originating in Phuket to Vancouver through Guangzhou.

Onboard, seats are old and tatty, cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever. The food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me, and what a lousy offering this was - below many airline economy meal standards. IFE screen was not working properly, fuzzy and very poor. Cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly, but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight, they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these.

Check in at CTU was very efficient as was security there. Once we reached the assigned gate we were told that there was a gate change but it was just across the terminal - no problem. Then the flight was called and we found that we had to go downstairs and onto a bus to be transported to the plane. After riding all around Chengdu airport (which is large) we finally reached our plane. Of course it was parked at a remote place and we had to climb stairs to the cabin.

"Vancouver to Montreal. This was my first time flying with a child. I have a 6-month-old son and my wife and I decided to pay extra to get premium economy seats and take advantage of more leg room and seats that would allow us to leave the plane quicker. As soon as I received an online confirmation of my purchase, I went on their website to select the premium seats, on their website. Every time I selected the premium seats I wanted to use and hit 'confirm seat selection', the website would take me to another page, and then timed out my request. I tried to complete this procedure 11 times, to no avail. I then thought I might not be able to get the premium seats I want, but at least I have premium seats, so I'll try the regular check-in 24 hours before departure. To my surprise, I was unable to get any premium seats at all and no one could see on the system that I had paid for premium seats. The check-in staff then told me that there was no premium economy in that flight, just business or regular economy. That was a lie, as I found out as soon as I entered the plane. I almost went back to the counter to discuss why would they lie to me so I could just get in the plane and take the seat they assigned me instead of what I had paid for. I mean, think about it. If you pay for business and wait until you reach the airport to complete the check-in, you might not have a say in which seat you'll get, but you'll have a business seat. Same goes for first class, and one would think the same would apply to premium economy but apparently you can pay over $100/px for what they call the 'comfort package', and they don't care to hold the seat for you. The very least they could have done is to upgrade my wife and I to business, as there were empty seats there. Now I had to call customer service and spend over one hour for them to guarantee us on the premium seats on our return flight, but I am still expecting a full refund for the premium seats I was denied despite having paid for them.",Detractor

"  I am just sad to have to write this review. I changed from Lufthansa to British Airways more then 10 years ago, because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way. Mostly flying between Berlin, the US and in recent years very frequently Cape Town. BA had more modern planes, innovative products like a great (rather new) First Class, lie-flat seats in Business Class, a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom. Flying from Cape Town to Berlin in January to keep my Silver Status made me realise, that none of my initial reasons to choose BA still exists, with the exception of the great cabin staff, that I feel really sorry for. The owners hired Ãlex Cruz last year, a very experienced low-cost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: Turning BA into a low-cost carrier. Unfortunately. The result is a pity. No more service on short haul flights, reduced service, only paid snacks on long-haul, worn 747's to Cape Town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards. British Airways as a premium airline is lost. Realistically for year to come. Even with my status renewed, I don't think I will fly them again if I don't have to. Meanwhile I understand, that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes. I do hope BA will do so in the hopefully not to distant future - and keep their great staff on ground and on board.",Detractor

The flight attendants are always friendly and offered frequently drinks and snacks during the flight. Since Austrian modified the business class cabin a few years ago I prefer to travel Austrian business than LH first class.

"Full flight from Miami to Lima. Embarked, then told to debark due to some technical issues. Thus, delayed flight. An hour later boarded the same plane - old, falling apart Boeing 757. Torn seat upholstery, broken armrests, non-existent entertainment, lousy service. Plane felt cramped, as there were not enough space for all the luggage in the overhead bins and it was stored everywhere, reducing already minimal leg room for most. Exit row ""economy premium"" upgrade is a scam - hard, narrow seat with abysmal recline. I would never pay anything extra for this! There were no proper fastened seat belts checks done and laptop bags and other items were allowed to be stored on the floor, blocking emergency exits. Sad, if this is the way ""new American Airlines"" feels, looks and flies like. Fly someone else, if you can.",Detractor
GYD-RIX-SVO. Air Baltic is a 'cheap' US-style carrier. Air Baltic appeared to be the least expensive option. Arrived at GYD to discover that I had to pay 40 euro in cash for the privilege of checking a single bag. Had I known this beforehand I would have factored it into the price and chosen a different airline. On the plane I was told that I would have to pay for water if I wanted a drink! If I wanted poor American-style service and 'hidden fees' I would have stayed in America for my vacation. Also the plane didn't have the customary map TV on the seat in front of me. For a European airline Air Baltic is absolutely dire. Will never fly again.,Detractor

"  New York JFK to Harare return via Johannesburg. One of the worst travelling experiences I've ever had. On my leg from JFK to Johannesburg , the entertainment system on my seat was not working. I had to spend the flight with no TV while everyone else around me enjoyed their entertainment systems. When asked, the air hostess stated she had attempted to reset the system but failed and since she was not an engineer, there was nothing else she could do. I asked if I could be moved to different seat, but that could not be accommodated. One my flight back to JFK, the airline lost 1 of my 2 suitcases. The suitcase literally vanished into thin air and has not been able to be traced. I called the airline for 2 weeks straight with no one able to give any information regarding my bag. I literally called SAA at least 50 times, each time getting a different service agent who was less helpful than the last. This trip was an absolute nightmare - I'm still missing my luggage and have not been compensated for it. Not a single person from SAA has contacted me and they have the worst customer service imaginable.",Detractor

"Living near Brussels often obliged me to book Brussels Airlines (BA) for short flights. Although being a FF, nothing really distinguished me from the once-a-year tourist flyer. BA often changes my (chosen and paid for choice) seat. Its frequent delays (""due to late arrival"" - I add ""of the BA flight"") are nerve-racking as they never inform you - even if they have my smartphone number. It uses subcontractors in other airports who simply don't know what they stand for (when I have for instance a golf bag, it takes an extra 15 min for check in to verify why I don't have to pay). It never serves a drink or snack in economy (or what is equivalent to it). And when you have to pay for it, often your choice is not available. No onboard newspaper (standard with normal commercial airlines economy). Excellent in sending excuses and offering (worthless) compensation. Many incidents on its booking sites (so that you can start all over again at higher prices). Too costly for very low value. Avoid it if you can. I decided never to rely on it anymore preferring connecting flights than direct flights with this kind of company.",Detractor

I had my trip to Vegas booked and paid for five months prior to this and I was looking forward to it. I get to the airport and found it weird there was no one around at the Frontier counter, so I started to ask why? Come to find out the flight I paid for was cancelled for whatever reason and I was supposed to be on the 5:55 pm flight. I had no idea because they never let me know. Needless to say my entire trip was ruined because of this airline! The next flight they had going to Vegas was two days later, that was pointless because i was due to come back the next day.

Chose Air India as it was the best schedule and best fare for non-stop service JFK-Delhi on B777. Using their website for anything but purchases and seat selection was a waste of time. Endless circles asking and re-asking for information. Calling their help center was also somewhat futile due to language issues and lack of proper training. Our outbound flight was delayed 5 hours but the airline did call and text with the news. So that was decent of them but no apology for the delay and we lost half a day in India. Seats had uncomfortable cushions and were tightly spaced. Luckily the flight was quite empty so most people had 2 or 3 seats to themselves outbound. In-flight AVOD could be good but the touch screens were not working so well and the hand held device was worthless. Flight back was delayed by nearly an hour due to late arrival. Same uncomfortable seats and slow touch screens. Service both ways was efficient limited and far from gracious. Announcements were few. All in all it was a very average flight with below average service. The only reason to use them is the low cost.,Passive
Flew non-stop Boston to FCO on March 19 and returned on the 28th. Have to say overall they have improved since my last flight in 2011 and dramatically so in the last 10 years. My pet peeve however is the lack of safety enforcement on the plane on takeoff and landing. Unlike other airlines not a single flight attendant came around to make sure seats were in the proper position (many were fully reclined) and several people were up and walking around indeed going into the overhead bins during or shortly after takeoff and landing on both flights! Very dangerous. Also although I had requested a gluten free meal I was served my gf meal with a wheat roll sitting in the coffee cup. Good thing I am every vigilant and did not assume that this was the best gluten free roll ever made! Also wish they would allow one to choose seat assignments at the time of booking like every other airline on the planet.,Passive
"  First off, wasn't thrilled about having to check in through a kiosk machine and paying $50 for a suitcase, but flying from Oakland to Las Vegas at least the person behind the check-in counter was at least kind enough to help us out when we had questions regarding using the self serve machine. Not so much coming from Las Vegas to Oakland the person behind the counter would not answer any questions would not do anything kept quoting the fact that is it a it is a self interactive kiosk to do your own check-in otherwise he needed to charge us $10 a person for any help. He would not even answer a single question was so rude. $50 each way for a 1 checked bag each way is very expensive, so maybe the flight being cheaper does not really matter because you're paying a lot more with a suitcase. Also, the legroom and seats are extremely tight - never will use this airline again.",Detractor

" I booked a flight from Houston to Toronto with a layover in Chicago. My flight from Chicago to Toronto was supposed to leave at 3 p.m. We were supposed to start boarding at 2:30 p.m. My flight into Chicago landed at 2:10 p.m. after which I ran to get to my gate. I arrived there at 2:25 p.m. and waited for them to start boarding. At around 2:35 p.m. the agent at the counter said that they were waiting on a crew member to start boarding, that she was flying in to gate L10, and would come right over (we were at gate L8). After about 10-15 minutes we got another update that the crew member had landed and was on her way over. At around 3:10 p.m. we started boarding and was on the plane waiting to leave by 3:30 p.m. The pilot announced that there would be a bit of delay because there was a plane in front of us. So we waited. After about 20 minutes, he announced that the storm that they were trying to avoid had hit Toronto so we couldn't leave. We were going to turn back and deplane, that the delay would be about 4 hours. Then when we deplaned, they cancelled the flight. I called the rebooking number to book another flight and they put me on the 11:52 a.m. flight the next morning. Tried to get a hotel voucher and the agent says to me that in the system, the reason for the booking was as a result of weather, so no vouchers were being offered. I countered that had we not waited on that crew member and left at 3 p.m. as originally scheduled, we would've missed the storm.

"Will never fly AA again. I was scheduled on a 4pm flight from Sacramento to LAX on Saturday, Oct. 11th. I arrived at 2pm for the flight. It was marked as 'delayed' and re-scheduled for 5:45pm departure. At about 5pm I moved my seat closer to the gate counter to listen to the staff conversation about updates. They had probably a dozen conversations with maintenance people, pilots, etc all in hushed tones to one another. Then, when someone would approach the staff, they would rudely say 'we know nothing - you'll have to sit back down and wait'. Super rude to nearly every person who approached to ask. At 7.30pm - after only 1 announcement over a speaker about what is happening, they canceled the flight. A long line of people had been waiting to talk to gate attendants for the last several hours, but most of the attendants were just beyond rude - no information, wouldn't look at people, just kept typing away for hours with nothing actually happening. We run down to the ticketing booths to get our flights re-booked. Of course, by this time there were no other flights to LAX that night. Again, if people had known an hour earlier that the chances were unlikely that they would get to LAX that night, they would have tried to get on another flight. As I wait in line I re-book a flight over the phone in 5 minutes. However, I then need a hotel voucher, as my flight left at 7am. After waiting in line at the ticketing booth for 2.5 hours someone finally provided vouchers to everyone waiting. 7After waiting for hotel shuttle to arrive for 45 minutes, a group of us finally pay for a cab to the hotel. We walk in at 10pm and the lone hotel staffer has no idea that we were coming, and also has no idea what airline vouchers are. They also only have 4 rooms available. As our group finally gets rooms a large group arrives from our plane with vouchers in hand, only to be told there were no rooms available. I'm guessing these people, after spending 8 hours waiting, just went back to the airport to sleep. Again - things happen, planes get delayed/canceled by nobody's fault. However if the staff had been remotely professional and fore-thinking, they could have got people with important connections on other flights before it was too late. The staff could have communicated at least a few times over the course of hours to everyone, helping to alleviate the confusion and hysteria that grew out of knowing NOTHING.

I flew LHR-DEL-LHR and this was my first AI experience. Overall I would say it wasn't bad but it could easily be so much more better. Check-ins both in London and Delhi were smooth and easy. On Board service and facilities lets it down. The staff even though well meaning are not interested. They simply did their three rounds (1 round of drinks and 2 of meals) and no more. On both flights the service call bell was not attended to even though I must have pressed it for at least 10 mins before giving up and getting up! On the LHR-DEL flight I did not complain about it but when I enquired on the DEL-LHR flight about why they did not attend to the service call they could not find it on the system. Most airlines if not all come and collect the rubbish the headsets etc simple clearing up tasks which weren't performed by AI staff.,Passive
"  Fabulous A350 from Gatwick to Manila via Hong Kong, my first time flying from Gatwick which is far nearer for me. Check in fast and friendly, Lounge No 1 isn't as bad as I feared but food is very limited. Arrive at departure gate exactly 35 mins prior to departure and I just walked straight onto my flight. A brand new A350 with a gorgeous modern cabin, a good start so far, I settle into my new business class seat and noticed a much larger TV, superior remote control and the seat seem to have a little more padding and a little bit wider. I found I can watch a movie before take off unlike the B777, I also found a more detailed flight map, flight details and two outside cameras. I settle into my sleep blanket which actually work just like a sleeping bag, a clever idea. A high standard of food and excellent cabin staff, the cabin pressure and air conditioning is much improved.

"Some improvements noted. We flew Air Canada rouge about two years ago on a similar route (AC regular YVR to Toronto then on Rouge to Cuba). That trip was really awful because of the cramped and thin seats. This trip was somewhat better. First we were given a surprise upgrade to the ""business"" section up front. I often fly AC regular and get upgrades to business class. I think Air Canada rouge business on this flight was pretty close on comfort of seats (4 abreast) with good leg room (close to AC Business). The lunch served was satisfactory and hot. This review focusses on our economy return flight. On the way back to Toronto we were in the back of the plane and the seats were exactly as we experienced on our first trip. Very, very tight for leg room and with a seat that was too short, too thin and had insufficient padding for the lower back (read no padding at all so any movement behind gets to you). But having suffered back pain on our earlier flight for days afterward, I planned things better and brought a coccyx cushion and it made a world of difference! Legs still too tight but back in better shape at the end. I noted that the crew both ways appeared to have learned over time - they put those silly hats away and were efficient and friendly (but not as silly friendly as previously). After our first trip I vowed never to fly Air Canada rouge again but our two week vacation in Cuba would not work with WestJet so we grudgingly tried Rouge again. Still not comfortable but better for service (and bring your own cushion it really made a difference to me).",Detractor

"Adelaide to London via Singapore was my first experience of Business Class on Singapore Airlines A380, and I was disappointed. Food, IFE, crew etc. were fine (though nothing exceptional) but the seating was a big let-down. With a 1x2x1 configuration, each seat is absurdly wide, which does not make for comfort - with only one armrest usable, the other side requires a pile of cushions as a substitute. The beds do not flatten electronically, and need folding down by hand, a rather cumbersome procedure. When flat the bed is not particularly comfortable, with a small off-set ""cubby hole"" for one's feet. Furthermore, the overall feel of the cabin was pretty tired",Detractor

Do not use this airline. We did because we thought it was cheaper. Not so! Not only do they charge for checked bags they charge for carry on as well. Also if you do check in online. When we boarded we found French fries and other food matter on our seat and on the floor. he plane was filthy. As soon as the doors were closed we were told there was no running water on board. The toilets did not flush because of this. You can imagine the stench. They put coffee bags taped to the restroom wall to help with the smell. Really? Furthermore no free anything. We paid for soda couldn't get coffee or tea (no water) and the flight attendants were all inexperienced.,Detractor
"  We booked our trip from Dallas to New York La Guardia in the spring. We received confirmation immediately.

When my husband attempted to choose our seats and check in, he was told that my seat was on standby. I immediately began to panic. He called the airline to correct the obvious mistake, only to be told that we needed to upgrade to premium seats that cost an added $60. We had no other choice since our original seats had been given away. As we were about to board, the attendant said that our seats were not premium. We ended up in economy as originally assigned, plus we were out an additional $60. We were economy on the way home also. This experience was stressful. I cried, not knowing multiple times if we were going to actually have a seat that had been guaranteed months before! I will not fly this airline again since they were unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate our stress or the extra money that we paid to guarantee a seat.",Detractor

"I left last Monday from Oakland Airport with a stopover in Phoenix and then onto Omaha. Well, due to poor weather we circled Phoenix airport until we ran low on fuel. We were then informed we would be going to Tuscon to get more fuel, we landed in Tuscon and were assured repeatedly it wouldn't take much time and we'd back in Phoenix very soon. Long and short of it, there was a line of planes ahead of us. They would not allow anyone off and we sat there for about 2 hours before getting refueled while being told we were headed back to Phoenix shortly. No food, people missed connecting flights, I was forced to say overnight in Phoenix and missed a very important day of work in Omaha. American insisted they would not offer any compensation in terms of food, hotel, etc., since it was weather related. On top of I found out from another flyer the hotel rooms offered at a ""discount"" at the Red Lion Inn were actually more expensive than their regular prices. Waiting in American Airlines customer service line was horrible, took a long time (over an hour) with lots of angry people. By the time I got another flight the next day and a room I got 2 hours of sleep.

"  Sofia to London Heathrow, and the flight was on time. However cabin interior is awful, seats are cramped and uncomfortable. On board service quality has declined on BA flights and this flight was not exception. Offered food was only a sandwich (compared to hot meal recently) - it's a joke. Economy Class complimentary service will end soon. Cabin crew was just OK, but I'm giving 2 stars because they can't be much greater than the level of services provided. Our luggage was delayed 45 mins at Heathrow Terminal 5. BA now offering low-cost airline standard - the only difference is price, it's more expensive which makes poor value for money.

Travelled from Manchester UK to Newark then onwards to Las Vegas. Was very apprehensive after reading some dreadful reviews of UA. Became more apprehensive when attempting online check in 24hrs before the flight - our two seats were not together which for a long flight was a concern. After trying to finalise online check in I received an error message informing me online checkin hadn't worked. Arrived at Manchester and told that unlikely we'd get seats together in fact the flight full so although we had seats they were yet to be allocated & we'd need to wait for further instructions at the boarding gate. Luckily somehow we went from having seats apart to having no seats to somehow having an upgrade to Economy Plus! No idea how on a full flight we managed this but was great. Fantastic legroom (would pay extra on long haul now I know how much better the legroom. Food very good eggplant lasagne was lovely. Inflight entertainment was very good. Flights ahead of time. Internal flight between Newark & Las Vegas fairly standard neither good nor bad. Found direct comparison between Economy Plus & Economy legroom! No free food offered on the 5hr internal flight although available to purchase. Overall was very pleased with the flights however unsure I'd want a repeat of the apprehension again wondering if we had seats never mind sitting together! I'm scoring high for what we received but unsure I'd travel with them again as could so easily have turned out badly & also couldn't recommend to friends in case they have the nerves I had in advance and at the airport caused by UA procedure FOR online checkin/not allocating seats/together.,Promoter

"Having booked Premium economy through lastminute.com it showed us in premier from Dublin to Toronto and then business from Toronto to Las Vegas. Very happy with this, I then reviewed Air Canada and found out about the new Air Canada rouge and then worried and having read all the reviews, worried even more. Having just arrived home I can tell anyone flying Air Canada rouge in ""Premier Rouge"" not to worry at all. It is a mix of business and premium economy. We had two bags checked to 32kg each, express check in and express security alongside priority boarding made the whole airport experience totally stress free. Having boarded we were greeted onboard the Dublin to Toronto flight with a glass of complimentary water/OJ and also had two bottles of water waiting for us at our seats with a complimentary ""pack"" containing flight socks, ear plugs, face mask, headphones & toothbrush and toothpaste. This was in addition to the pillow and blanket. As people were boarding we were given our meal menu and complimentary iPads which we were able to hang from the seat in front. It was no different to any other airlines inflight entertainment system. As it was their ipad they had additional up to date movies to also watch. A nice large armrest between us with a built in tray for holding drinks was very convenient. Our order was taken and after take off, our table was set for us with linen cloths and selection of proper cutlery with wine glass for our meal which was lovely. Complimentary drinks ""wine, spirits etc"" the whole way also made our first flight a very pleasant and comfortable experience. People also complained about the trays which you retrieved from your armrest. There was no issue with these at all and a child could take them out. They also ""slid"" forward and back making it very convenient if you were working on a laptop or viewing your ipad from your table instead of hanging it from the headrest. Each flight was similar in standard except the seats were larger and more ""business"" from Toronto to Las Vegas. I liked these seats and whilst they were bigger in size they did not recline as much as the Dublin to Toronto flight which was surprising. My wife was also given a complimentary inflatable neck pillow on the Toronto to Las Vegas flight. Overall the only complaint I would have would be the recline of the seats which at 7 inches was not ideal for sleeping on the homeward night flight. (We flew Delta and the recline in premium economy was much greater). We were seated in the bulkhead seats on the homeward flight and at 5ft 11, I found the legroom just slightly tight, we had more legroom in the bulkhead middle aisle than those at the bulkhead on the side aisles. If not in the bulk head you have no worries at all. If it wasn't a night flight I would have had no issue with the leg room as you could still ""stretch out"" slightly. We were seated in rows 3 for Dublin to Toronto, rows 2 for the Toronto to Las Vegas and Las Vegas to Toronto with row 1 for Toronto to Dublin. So If you are flying premier rouge do not worry, you have plenty of leg room, good attentive service, complimentary drinks and a much better meal and the additional perks at the airport with extra luggage allowance and ""priority luggage"" also means your bags arrive first. Comparing them to Delta, who we previously flew premium economy with, I would fly Air Canada rouge again without any worry as they have a much better overall package.",Promoter

  Paris to Melbourne via Abu Dhabi with Etihad. Check in at CDG - I had to return to check in to obtain a baggage receipt which was not given to me. From experience it's needed.

However it arrived quite soon after take off along with other passengers' meals. Again no drink which was ordered. The usual bottle of water was not waiting in my seat or offered during the flight. Dessert was ordered. Again it never arrived. About seven hours later I asked for an item from the Etihad order at any time menu. It arrived 45 minutes later. I had to ask twice for something to drink. Entertainment was largely not interesting and was much the same as my flight seven weeks previously. My priority tagged luggage arrived an hour after landing as I was completing a lost luggage claim. Last year my luggage arrived a week later.

Had to find quick non-stop flight from Dallas to Orlando. Spirit fit the time frame and would have me there by 7.08pm. When we arrived at DFW flight was on time. Then at 1.30 the flight board showed a 90 minute delay. By 2.30 it was a 3 hour delay. Instead of leaving at 3.39pm it was now a 6.45pm departure. First time my wife and flew Spirit and was surprised at all of the added fees. Time was of the essence so we gave it a shot due to having 'lower' rates. Total cost would have been comparable to other rates from airlines with a better on time average which I learned while sitting waiting for my very delayed flight.

"We flew with Ryanair returning from Dublin before our flight to Palma. I was surprised despite the reviews. I dont think the reviews are fair. The terms regarding boarding passes are clear and the technology savvy can easily find out this information. I see one review about using apps to check in with other airlines, so why such a tech block with Ryanair? They have an app, it reminds you of your flight even without, and the email in gmail tells you to check in (gives a link) follow the link and it tells you to print, or download boarding pass. Anyway, extremely efficient. Which was wonderful with 3 kids in tow. I cannot complain whatsoever. The luggage was not a problem again you just have to be savvy and dont try to go over just incase. But in my opinion unless you've got gold bars in the allocated sized bag there's no way. I put all my heavies in the 2nd bag. We fly again with them next week and will do again and again.",Promoter

Manchester to Florida via Chicago. I had no real issue with the internal flights to Chicago but have a number of issues with the long haul flight to Chicago. The seats were in no way suitable very little leg room and I can imagine that it was very awkward if you didn't know the person sitting either side of you. The food wasn't too bad on the way out but if you suffered any dietary requirements it was tough. The flight ran out of certain drinks outbound and on the return journey. On the return journey we were sat at the back and we had to settle for what was left food wise as they'd run out of one of the options. The majority of the attendants were either rude sarcastic and had obviously missed the training session on customer service. Inflight entertainment was poor AA seem to be stuck in the dark ages with one tiny screen for every few seats. Overall I was very disappointed with the service which made a long flight seem even longer. I've definitely been spoilt with Virgin Atlantic who I will be using from now on.,Detractor
"Two wonderful flights with engaging and helpful crews. Check in agent a little off hand and only issued connecting boarding pass for one of us. LAX Star Alliance lounge run by Air NZ much more pleasant then the old T2 lounge, NZ 5 flight left on time, meals and wines excellent. Slept very well. Connected with NZ 135 also left on time and Auckland lounge was good, food better that usual for breakfast although didn't need more than a snack. Flight to Brisbane equally competent. IFE on both excellent choice although only had the new system on NZ 5 which is a vast improvement on the old one. Bags off promptly and out of the airport in 15 minutes.",Promoter
"  Santorini to Athens. We had a flight at 7:30pm which was delayed for two hours due to what they called ""bad weather"". Olympic Air had a flight at the same time and they were able to fly. After waiting two hours they had everyone go through the security line again and then to find out the flight was cancelled. Due to this flight being cancel we couldn't make it to our flight from Athens back to the United States. The only thing Ryanair could due was provide hotel for the night. We couldn't make it to our flight and had to purchase new tickets back home which was expensive! Never flying Ryanair again.",Detractor
"The ground staff at Sydney airport were a bit rude and unfriendly. Airplane was very old, the food tray did not come out so staff apologised and gave us a cushion to put the food tray on. My seat would not go back as promised. It looks like Cathay Pacific need to spend more money to keep the level of maintenance higher.

HKG-NRT return. If you are tall Y class is very small the seat does not recline it slides so you end up with your knees in the seat in front. Still very bearable for a 4 hour flight.

"  Flying Business class on Cebu to Hong Kong route was a bit of a shock, as this plane has a 2x3x2 configuration. This resembled more like premium economy so a huge let down by this airline putting on substandard business class. Service was also like economy class - quick and fast with not much of a smile from cabin crew either. IFE was fine though. Food still average and these days its all Asian style food so if you want western food you out of luck. Unless they put on a new plane with the much more business class set up of 1x2x1 avoid this route. It was a let down.",Detractor
"â Unverified | The first Spirit Airlines flight from Havana to Fort Lauderdale went fine. There we checked our luggage in again and got our new boarding passes. We went to the gate where we waited to board. 30 minutes before the flight were scheduled to take off, it was announced the flight was cancelled due to not enough staff. So we had to go down and get a new ticket for the following evening and got some coupons for a hotel and some coupons for some food (7$ pr meal, a meal was about 20$). We had a small, local flight in Panama we would miss, and they wouldn't do anything to help us. So when we got to hotel at 1 am, we had to go online and book a new ticket. The next day we go out to the airport 3,5 hours before we are flying out. I have never seen so many people waiting in line. They must have known a lot of people were getting to the airport. But they still only had a few counters open. It took forever and there was no help and not at once did anybody said they were sorry for the convenience. Never going to buy a ticket from that company.",Detractor
We were scheduled to fly out of SFO on April 3rd UA1169. Then to Addis Ababa on April 4th: LH419. Unfortunately we were not notified of the pilots strike until Wednesday afternoon April 2nd. We went to the SFO airport on April 2nd and were unable to obtain alternate flights that day. After several hours Lufthansa scheduled us to go through Seoul Hong Kong and on to Addis. However in the arrangement the last leg of our return flight on May 3rd had been deleted from the Lufthansa reservation list. The flight out of Addis LH 599 was 2 hours late leaving (no explanation given) which meant we had to run through the terminal in Frankfurt to catch the flight to Los Angeles. That flight left and arrived on time. Then we found we had no reservation from LAX to FAT. It was not a good experience! I have flown Lufthansa for 40 years and will continue to do so however this trip was not good for us.,Detractor

"We flew AC Rouge to Venice on Aug 23 having paid for the extra leg room seats. The flight was good and the extra leg room was great. Having read many reviews complaining about the cramped seats. It would be nice if the cost of the extra leg room seats included a few extra perks (like priority boarding and/or free drinks) as $90 for a one way is a bit steep. The flight was good excellent service. I was surprised that a flight to Italy did not have any announcements in Italian. The in-flight entertainment was OK on our iPhone and iPad. Although not ""advertised"" the USB plug on the arm rest came in handy for keeping our devices charged. There is also plug to be shared between the two seats by the window. Movie choices were OK but not as good as the mainline aircraft. I also really missed the flight data and maps that are available on most airlines.",Passive
Our flight from Belfast to Malaga was cancelled on the 8/4/2014 reasons unknown and we were moved to the 9th. This was unsuitable so I called the customer services and without any hassle we were moved to a flight departing Dublin for the original date. When we checked in via the self check in machine our pre booked seats had changed and when mentioned to the desk staff they quickly corrected our seats back to the original with a sincere apology. The morning flight was on an A330 the advantage to this was we had IFE for the short 3 hour flight but it was a welcomed bonus. Crew were friendly and accommodating to any request and seemed to enjoyed serving the customers with a smile even when it was a full flight. This was a faultless flight in every respect arriving at destination bang on time. I really can't fault this airline every single employee I had connect with either from the call center to the gate agents to the cabin crew made us feel welcomed. It is a shame that the return flight from Malaga to Belfast left to early for us otherwise I would have made this a return trip.,Promoter

"Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur. Flight was retimed to 2hrs later and the airline informed me less than 24hours before, which was too late to make other arrangements. I tried contacting the airline via live chat and twitter as they don't have a call centre. After hours trying to reach the live chat agent, I was told they could not do anything for me. Then I contacted them via Twitter and they informed me that I can opt for an earlier flight which was 2hrs earlier than my flight and I have to be put on standby at the airport, without any guarantee that I can fly then. I end up flying at 2050hrs instead of the original 1835hrs departure. Arrived at the airport and checked in. The agent informed me that they will compensate the delay by providing meals which was just average. Boarding was quick. The flight was parked at a remote stand, and were transported by a bus. Once onboard, the crew apologised for the delay many times and we very polite. The sale of inflight meals and snacks was done professionally with a wide range of hot meals and snacks at affordable prices. The flight was uneventful and before arrival, the crew bowed and thanked us for flying with them.",Passive
" Bangkok to Stockholm via Dusseldorf. Cancelled our flight less than 24 hours before the flight schedule and no help whatsoever. No grounds personnel in sight.

On their facebook, they assured that they would compensate the affected passengers but after reading reviews now, I doubt it. I was only in transit in Bangkok and had nowhere to go. I could either wait for them to respond to me or book another flight at my own expense, so I did the latter. Glad I didn't wait because now it's been 2 weeks since I sent my refund request (not even asking for compensation for the more expensive on-the-spot ticket) but there's been no reply not even an autoresponse saying it's been received! They don't want to give money back for a flight they did not deliver. Very frustrating service and the travel agent did not help either. This experience ruined my Christmas holiday.",Detractor
" Dallas DFW to Phoenix. This was my first, and probably only flight, I've ever taken with Spirit. Everything started off well, on time flight, easy check in, things going great. The workers for Spirit were kind and welcoming. Boarded the plane, and I had the window seat. 2 people were in the others, so i asked them to move so I could get to it quickly - nothing out of the ordinary. There was a woman in the aisle and a man in the middle. The woman stood up and instead of the man standing or scooting, he sat on his seat which caused me to bump past him. Weird, but oh well. Throughout the next 2.5 hours, the couple took off their shoes - the woman her socks off as well. They were bumping into me while they rubbed each other's arms and legs. The woman was shaking the seats so much that I was being bounced around. She would bang her head on the person in front of her's seat and her hands on the tray table. Just very rude. They didn't wear seatbelts and the whole ordeal made me feel so uncomfortable. Especially when the woman put her feet ON the man's tray table and had him give her a massage. Keep in mind they were probably late 30's, early 40's, and I am in my early 20's. Overall, the experience was terrible and so uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to get off.",Detractor

"American Airlines ground handling at Heathrow is slapdash, disappointing considering it's AA's own staff. Despite having Oneworld Elite status, no priority tags, explanation of lounge options or recognition at check-in or boarding gate (use of my name just once would have been nice). Used the British Airways lounge, and it was fine for a coffee and afternoon tea. Boarding at LHR chaotic. Onboard, the crew were friendly and jovial, the new Business Class seat is comfy, lots of storage, great IFE and Bose headsets. Wifi did dropout numerous times. The dining was second to none, compared to British Airways where a tray is thrown at you in Club World and the main course in overcooked and swimming in liquid.

Onboard, the seats were quite comfortable and spacious, compared to seats on other A380's and B787's. Food was served fast, heated, and tasty. IFE was very user-friendly and had enough entertainment for the 7hr journey. Flight crew were checking on us and our child and always on hand to help. Plane was very clean and loved the Boeing 787.

Waited 45 minutes to get through customs, baggage was another 20 minutes before they got it on the carousel.

The transfer baggage counter had actually closed 20 minutes before we arrived. We were forced to spend the night in Toronto. Toronto Airport is a terribly disorganized Airport and Air Canada fell very short of what I have known them to be. They charged for extra baggage even though they participate in a codeshare. They also took advantage of inexperienced travelers by checking in two people booked on one ticket so they could double the extra baggage charge.

"After 10-15 years of flying Singapore, I think I'll finally stop now. Over the last 2-3 years the service quality has become dire. Plane age and upkeep seems to be getting worse, with cabins uncared for. My biggest ire is the decrease in service for economy, or overworking the premium seats. Both in London, Singapore, and Auckland I've seen that they now have 3-4 check in desks for business, with no customers, yet only 1 for economy, with an hour long queue. The last flight (SIN-ATH), an argument broke out between staff and customers while boarding, as the staff tried to push past boarding economy customers to serve juice to the business passengers. I may not pay quadruple price to sit in business, but I am still a paying customer. Sorry Singapore, you've tried to compete with the UAE for business passengers, and alienated the rest in the meantime.",Detractor

When we informed about the allergy to crew on board flight 488 they told us they can't make announcement about nut allergy due to change in policy and could not able to help us. Finally some of the passengers around us helped to request everyone about the allergy. The second leg of Journey (Flight 1121) crew told us they will make a courtesy announcement.

After reading some reviews we were worried about flying with this airline but as we were travelling from Cairo to Johannesburg we didn't have a choice. Given that we had low expectations we were pleasantly surprised with the overall experience. It wasn't up to scratch service wise as with other airlines we have flown but it was ok for the 8 hour flight. Meals are a little below par but edible. Drinks seem to only be offered at meal times so I suggest taking some on the plane with you. Inflight entertainment is via central screens around the aircraft - bring a book/laptop/ipod to keep you entertained as it is pretty average. If you have another choice of airline for a similar price then take that one. If you don't - just don't have high expectations and you will be ok. 8 hours was bearable but I wouldn't fly with them on a flight of any longer duration.,Passive
"  First time flying this route from Houston to Honolulu and I was not looking forward to it. Why? 8 hours in the sky with no free hot meals (you have to purchase from a menu and it's not cheap - $10 for a burger), no in-flight entertainment screens, and a sardine can economy cabin with the 3-4-3 seating arrangement. All this in mind and I was not eager to fly. As I boarded the plane and settled in my seat I noticed that yes the seats got narrower to accommodate more seats across but the seats are also new and well crafted with details. The seat was made out of this leather with detailed stitching patterns and a tag on the side that had the United logo on it and it had a cool color scheme to it too. Not only did it look good but it felt fairly comfortable for a small seat and the cushioning was decent. Legroom was also tolerable and take my word for it because I have very long legs. The seats didn't have those necessary in-flight entertainment screens but all seats were installed with a tablet/device holder so you can comfortably watch free entertainment on your personal device via the United wifi. (Make sure you have downloaded the United app before you board). The wifi connectivity was fairly strong though it didn't work the last half of the flight. Cabin crew were pleasant. They had poise, well groomed and very polite and I have no complaints or problems with them. The only huge disappointment I have is that for an 8-hour flight, no free meals were offered! It felt like a long-haul budget carrier flight! Of course, there was a full drink service. If you wanted to eat, you had to order from the menu a wide selection of hot meals that costed upwards $10. If it was that expensive then it should taste good I thought - which did. $10 Mediterranean chicken wrap was a rather small portion for a $10 meal but the tastes were worthy enough for you to think it came from Chipotle or something.",Passive

" Hong Kong to Bangkok. I reckon for the past 8 flights I've been on with them this year, they have been delayed ridiculously (two hours). Other airlines are not affected as much it seems. The advertisement of duty free sales in the inflight entertainment system is very annoying as well as unnecessary PA announcements such as that they're collecting donations for unicef. Their method of contacting customers regarding ticket bookings is terrible too. I was once called and sent a very vague email not mentioning the reason for contacting me. I only realised a couple of hours before a supposedly booked flight that the credit card payment didn't go through and that was what they were calling about. Would have been nice to have mentioned it as on the email instead of saying â€œwe tried to call you please reply when you are freeâ€ - which I did reply ASAP with no follow up.

The food was so-so but I wasn't very hungry anyway considering it was in the middle of the night when the food was served.

But we got into trouble in WAW since the flight did not make up the lost time from late departure and we missed our connecting flight to GDA. Business class rep from LOT was less than helpful, she could attempt to re-book us on another flight or go with us to the connecting flight and ask if someone would give up their place for a reward - normal scenario here after all we were going business class. All she did was to offer to have us stay day longer in WAW and maybe take another flight to GDA next day, she also suggested a train - she did not bother to book us on the train, she did not even told us about the train schedule, she just tried to get us out and stop bothering her - bad experience here all around.

"  Newark to London Heathrow. This was the first time I have flown long-haul BA for sometime (although I am BA Goldcard holder due to my travels on other Oneworld Carriers). The lounge in Newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate First section and food is only offered for business and first passengers. Super views over the airfield. Boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition. This was a new Boeing 787 however the Ying-Yang seat configuration, no air vents, high density, poor quality food (and very little of it), very basic toilet facilities (compared to American business class on the same route), a shoe bag instead of amenity kit.

"  Manchester to Tenerife South. After the bad reviews I had read I was pleasantly surprised. We checked in within 10 minutes unfortunately my pre booked seats he been allocated to other passengers however we were still seated together and were happy with that, I was told at the desk to make a claim for the cost of the seats I have put the claim in so will see if I get the refund. No queues at boarding straight through no problens. The flight was on time, cabin staff polite and friendly and upon leaving the plane all bags were collected with no more than a 15 minute wait. All in all an easy, comfortable and pleasurable experience which was great as it was my youngest sons first time flying and he has many health and development issues and he was fine and loved it. No kids snack packs available which was a bit annoying but managed fine.",Promoter
"  Seattle to KeflavÃ­k roundtrip in Saga Class, Icelandair's premium product. The only reason to fly Icelandair is because the alternatives to get to Iceland from the West coast of the USA are worse. The only redeeming feature of Icelandair is, they are mostly on time and they don't lose your baggage. Other than that, the airline does not do anything to make the premium paying passenger experience pleasant or less unpleasant. At KeflavÃ­k airport, which is a zoo these days, there is no separate security screening line for Saga Class. At the Saga Lounge, vegetarians have very limited options. The aircraft are old, cabins are unkempt and the toilets dirty. The Saga Class seats are from the silent movie era. Coffee is served in paper cups, and those with dietary restrictions are out of luck if you forget to pre-order a special meal. All in all, Icelandair is a dismal experience.",Detractor

" Birmingham to Orlando. This was my first time using Frontier. Our flight was delayed twice and then cancelled which is a headache, but not a big deal since we were flying out of the city that we live in. However, the way it was handled was awful. When they cancelled the flight there was no information (text or email) sent out about the cancellation until after they already announced what they were going to do to fix it. When they announced over the intercom the flight was cancelled, they said that they would pay for another flight out from another airline. However, they waited so long to tell us, there were no other flights out. They said we could cancel the flight and get a refund. However, its $25 charge when canceling over the phone and we have been waiting for an hour and 30 mins to get a refund. I don't mind waiting, but they have announced 6 times what they are going to do and have yet to help one person at the counter. I will not be using this airline again and was very disappointed in how things were handled.",Detractor

" Overnight flight delayed in takeoff due to airport congestion brought on by inclement weather. On boarding the large number of passengers on this oversized aircraft was impressively quick and smooth. Flight attendants were elegantly efficient - the female flight attendants were strikingly lissome. Sitting configuration was 3-4-3. Seats were comfortable but given that most seats were occupied, the cabin felt crowded. Lots of film choices on the seatback personal entertainment system, they were easy to access. Ample overhead luggage space. Leg space a bit tight. Seat reclination juts the backseat TV screen rather close to your face and the tray table to your tummy. In fact, the flight attendants, while serving meals, ensured that the passengers returned the seats to a more straight up position. A dinner and a breakfast were served. A multi page menu book was provided to all. There were two entree choices for both meals - no vegetarian choice. That was a shocking surprise. I chose the fish dish. It was amply portioned and tasty. The breakfast cold sandwiches were dry and virtually inedible. Predinner drinks were served in plastic tumblers from a tray that flight attendants carried - juice, beer, white wine were on offer. Dinner and breakfast cutlery were metal, not plastic. Duty free catalog was thick but nothing distinctive products on offer. Cockpit crew kept us informed of the flight and take off delays. Singapore Airlines should consider their impact on the environment - on this relatively short overnight flight they can simplify the breakfast and dinner, dispense with the paper menu and the basic amenities bag and ensure a vegetarian option as standard. Bathrooms were clean throughout. A good option over Lufthansa or United. Arrived more or less on time after a somewhat bumpy flight.",Passive
"The flight back from Tokyo was awful. My in-flight entertainment was broken, they tried resetting it 3 times but it never worked. No music, movies, TV, games, nothing.

I emailed American in regards to my in-flight entertainment being inoperable and received a basic ""sorry, your experience doesn't qualify for any sort of compensation.""

" easyJet is is easily the best short-haul airline within Europe, especially as BA has cut inglight amenities without reducing their prices. We had an effortless journey from London Southend to Malta - the plane was clean and the seats comfortable enough for short journey. However it was the staff that made the difference, my partner left some duty-free a gift for his nephew in the terminal, he was a bit upset, but the cabin crew co-ordinating with the excellent and helpful Stobart Aviation ground staff managed to track it down in albeit a small terminal and retrieve it for him. This felt above and beyond and certainly more than I would have expected from an LCC. Both flights were uneventful, and we landed early on both occasions including a full 45 minute ahead of schedule on the return journey. If I was to be really picky, I would say the boarding experience could be better planned from Southend as it means standing in a cold although sheltered caged area for sometime before being allowed on to the plane and then having to go out in the open as there are no air-bridges at Southend Airport.",Promoter

" Denver to London via Keflavik. I bought a ticket from Denver to London flying via Icelandair for myself and my best friend, unfortunately on the day of departure, Denver airport was suffering delays across the board due to high winds. So when my connecting flight was delayed for three hours, I got to the airport with scarcely an hour before my Icelandair departure time. But luckily my friend and I managed to check in and run to the assigned gate ten minutes before departure. But instead of finding someone waiting for the two passengers that were sweating with effort to make that flight, the doors had been closed early and the gate had been abandoned. I tried everything in my power to get the attention of any gate attendant to receive assistance but I was turned away by every individual. It wasn't until the plane was backing out of the gate (five minutes prior to the scheduled departure time) that two women representing Icelandair appeared from the gate door. I can't say why one of them couldn't have stayed at the gate desk to offer help to people in need but regardless, they flat out refused to help me when I asked about our flight, and told me to call Iceland directly before they walked away. I called Icelandair, waited an hour to get a hold of a representative, only to be told that it was my fault for missing my flight. I politely argued that not only were there severe delays at the Denver airport, but the plane left early. And instead of an apology, or an offer for the next flight, I was told it is a requirement to check in at the gate an hour early. I replied by saying we checked in to the airport an hour early, and it doesn't say on my ticket, your website, or in my email confirmation to be at the gate an hour early. I suppose the customer representative realized they were conveying empty information to defend themselves against blame, and rebutted with â€œIt is common sense to be on time for your flight.â€ I was so shocked that I immediately asked to talk with a supervisor. But not much to my surprise, there was no supervisor present. But I suppose in an effort to cover for their mistake, I was put on hold and then offered the next flight to London, if I would pay an extra $1,200 per ticket. And she made sure to cut me off by saying â€œthat is all they can doâ€ for me. I refused and asked to be compensated if they could not get me on another flight without fee. Of course, they would not refund me for my already purchased tickets at all and told me to contact the carrier for my connecting flight which had been delayed for three hours since it was their fault I missed the plane, not theirs.",Detractor

I tried to explain the problem when I boarded the aircraft, but the cabin staff seemed indifferent and borderline rude! While in Italy, Alitalia agreed (via email) to refund the difference for the seat cost within one month. It's now been 3 months since their email and they haven't honoured their promise.

"New York to Singapore via Amsterdam with KLM.The flight from Singapore to Amsterdam on 6th November 2015 was delayed for about 2 hours due to the incoming flight from Bali having been delayed by volcanic activity in Bali. The cockpit crew did a good job and managed to make up for some time and arrived in Amsterdam slightly earlier which gave me an hour to transfer to a JFK bound Delta flight instead of 30mins. The cabin crew was pleasant and efficient. There was some light snacks available in the galley although the food portions for the 2 meal service seem a little light. I did see quite a few hungry passengers approaching the cabin crew for food about 8-10 hours into the flight. The meals were satisfying and had a decent variety of items. I took the exit row seat (50K) against the wall (no windows). The seats seem cramped. Whenever the gentlemen next to me unfold his arms, his arms would come into my seat area and rest over my arms. This is not a case of his arms resting on the shared arm rest but a case of the arms coming past the armrest into my seat area. I put it down to the seats being placed too close next to each other which made for a very uncomfortable 13-14 hours flight. I'm 5'6"" and not overweight so I don't think I was too large for my seat. The gentlemen was tall, large but not obese in anyway. Thankfully, the gentlemen made a point to fold his arms so that I didn't have to push my shoulders against the wall in order to give him space.",Passive

LHR-HEL-BKK-HKG-LHR good value in J class. LHR-HEL half full cabin. Used CX lounge at LHR which was adequate. No boarding drinks. Once airborne efficient and friendly service nice light dinner. Onward flight to BKK on A330-200 with new business class layout. Beautiful cabin pastel blue and grey colours. Solo window seat great flat seat allowed for comfortable sleep. Cabin crew although on the mature side very efficient friendly and warm. Also had oriental FAs who were probably more friendly. Entertainment system although AVOD was under par in terms of choices still lagging from their SE Asian counterparts! Food tasty but lacking presentation and probably the wow factor you expect in a premium cabin. I would compare it to SQ or CX excellent economy class fare but on fancy plates. All served in one tray needless to say servings on the small side. Breakfast was good but in terms of presentation had the feel of a very good economy cabin presentation. Arrival into BKK on time and was able to use fast track service for immigration. HKG-HEL-LHR. Morning flight ex-HKG on A330 with older cabin.

CX 879 SFO-HKG on 1/19/2014 in Business. This was a very poor business class service to HKG. The SFO lounge is a disgrace no First section a $12 bottle of champagne served and even that was not chilled and hence not available as they had received the shipment only in the morning. Seat 22A is in the 2nd small section of the business class cabin (3 class - no First on this service) and it is not at all private or inviting (and the crew made no attempts to make anyone feel welcome) main boarding is from this cabin so very rushed and feels like an extension of premium economy rather than a premium cabin (on a 5 star airline). No introduction or goodbye from the cabin service director (even on AA they do that) no welcome drink offered no news papers or magazines (sorry none loaded sir). Constant loud noise from the galley and the 2 main closets being opened and closed in this business section. Meal service very mediocre. Wines on the Chilean Promotion not loaded no other alternative. 2 Wines to choose from and the champagne was served across the entire cabin from one bottle (had to wait for it to be transferred back and forth and it was not chilled). Lights dimmed after 3 hrs only to be jarringly switched on full throttle 6 hrs into the flight while one is sleeping for dinner service. We had 8 more hrs to go why does pre-arrival dinner need to be served when all we are trying to do is sleep? Average food and not appetizing in presentation. Crew did dim the lights as I wanted to sleep but in general were not bothered one of the lav doors was always wide open and let out bright lights in the cabin and I stood up to close the door 4 times and the crew did nothing. No coffee water etc offered prior to arrival as galley was closed (1.5 hrs out of HK?). Even the new business class seat layout seems cramped even AA have better spacing (on the exact same seats on their 777-ER) and that is saying something. I'm sorry Cathay you missed the mark completely - both hard and soft product on this service. Yes they have good HK lounges but on board this product miserably failed to deliver.

" We flew from Dubrovonik to Palermo, Sicily and when we arrived our two bags did not arrive on the plane. After speaking to the baggage claims area we were given a case and reference number, we were told that if our bags did not arrive within 24 hours then we could spend 100Euro per person per day that our luggage was missing to buy essential clothes and toiletries (this was given to us in writing). We were told this would be claimed through Vueling Airlines and to keep all receipts. We never took advantage of this full amount and only purchased essential items and clothing for the remainder of our trip. After 24 hours and many phone calls our bags still had not arrived. As we had no toiletries or clothes we purchased only essential items that day. As each day passed and we did not receive our bags and in fact were never contacted (we had to ring numerous times each day) we purchased a small amount of items each day, always hoping our luggage would turn up. After 6 days of no luggage we were departing Europe to return home. One bag finally arrived on the final day (after 6 days) however the other bag never arrived. During the time we had no luggage we kept receipts for the essential clothing and amenities we required (this was under the 100 Euro per person per day that we were told we could claim). The missing bag was finally delivered to Australia 10 days after being lost and was NOT sent to our home instead we had to go to the airport to pick it up as we were told Vueling would not do so. Throughout this entire saga Vueling would not reply to any emails, phone calls etc. I then sent through all of the documentation required, boarding passes, receipts, case claim details etc. and sent them to Vueling. Without any explanation we received a refund of $500AUD for both bags that had gone missing (1 for 6 days and 1 for 10 days). The customer service with Vueling is disgusting. I have asked for explanations about the amount of refund and after being ignored for months received an email with their terms and conditions (which we were completely within). I sent an email showing that we in fact fell completely within their guidelines and after another month received a response saying â€œwe regret to inform you that once again we cannot give you a favorable answer due to the reasons we stated in our last communication.â€ I have spoken to many people about this disgraceful service and have been told by so many that they are known for always losing baggage and their appalling customer service. I would never use them again and would encourage others to avoid them if they did not want their holiday ruined by their shocking behaviour towards their clients.

"  Bangkok to Hong Kong. I was pleased with a good flight experience. Airlines in the region have cut back on quality of service, noticeable in aspects such as a lower quality of food, and cabins that are not as clean or upgraded as often as they could be. Cathay Pacific Airways still has a 2-3-2 configuration on its A330 planes and this configuration does not support a premium experience when business class customers still have to climb over someone to get to the lav. One must choose one's seat wisely. Despite this, I believe that Cathay remains the best of premium airlines in the region. FA service was top notch and when the my experience is compared to North American or European carriers on flights of a similar length, Cathay is superior. The meal served on the flight while not as good as it used to be was still respectable. Beverage selection was good. Baggage delivery, airport experience in both BKK and HKG was excellent.

I was carrying my purse (small), my small carry on luggage and the shopping bag from my duty free purchase, so according to her this was considered hand luggage as well. Never in all the airlines I have flown before ( and it's been many) have they considered my duty free bag as a carry on. Therefore she made me checked in my carry on luggage and pay 92.10. Mind you they do not advised you of this at the check in counter, but waited until I was at the gate to tell me and off course charge this outrageous amount. If I would have known, I would have not purchased a thing. According to one of the attendants there was plenty of room in this flight. They even charge you for headphones. Norwegian, advise your customer at check in that you are only allowed to bring two bags on the plane, and that the duty free shopping bag, no matter how small, will be considered a hand luggage. As for me and my family and friends will not fly Norwegian ever again.",Detractor
"  Lisbon to London Heathrow. Now that BA have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights, they might as well rebrand to a budget airline. Over the last few years, leg room across European flights (business and economy class) has decreased, to the point where it now practically the same as any budget airline. That said, it is in practice worse than budget airlines, because at least the main budget carriers have done the decent thing of removing the seat recline button, eliminating further discomfort. Even without the seat in front reclined, anyone taller than 5' 8"" will be packed in tightly on any European short-haul flight. The staff are friendly and polite. However, they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service, especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins. This does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers, but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets. Business class (which I sometimes use) is offered a free meal and drinks, all of a reasonable quality. However, in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy. The only reason I continue to fly BA is because I have fairly set routes and BA generally fly at times which suit me. Otherwise, I get little in the way of added value. The benefits of Avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it (in monetary terms), particularly if one mostly flies within Europe. It is much cheaper to get a lounge membership (many are valid for most European - and beyond - airports), rather than remain loyal to BA these days. I have been flying with BA for well over a decade now, on a monthly basis. My sympathies go to the staff, because I fear cost-cutting will get them next, which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day.",Detractor
Flew LBA to Riga. What's all the fuss about Ryanair. Stick to the rules print your Boarding Pass before you get to the Airport and everything is fine. Clean modern 737-800 both outward and return on time. Cabin Crew very pleasant. Cabin Manager very keen on safety aspect - which is good. Why do people leave their seats when the seat belt sign is on I do not know. Well done Ryanair - will certainly use them again.,Promoter

" A recent experience flying with Spirit Airlines from Baltimore to Los Angeles for someone who moves around in other countries quite a bit left me dumbfounded. How can such an airline stay in business regardless of the low frill business model in the current age that we should be demanding more and expect more for our buck. Rude and not very well trained check in staff, including the supervisors. The check in operations at the Airport was very mediocre at best. 5 hours flight with no entertainment on board not even a wireless one that you could connect your own device. Hardly any leg room across standard seats. They charge fees for checked in luggage to include carry on hand luggage. Should we not be demanding more from our Airlines in terms of service, offering and features? Are we going back in time, depriving travelers of essential services to enrich shareholders and executives. I got to my destination and find out that one of my suitcases was missing still as of 4 days later. What an Airline, incompetence, lack of service, unbelievable service.",Detractor
" New York to Beijing. Air China have no customer service, my flight was in the early morning I missed my flight the check in people could not help told me to call office which opens at 9:00 eastern time. After the long wait, you get and agent that can not rebook the flight because they need to recalculate fees. The accounting department does not get in until later. I was told to wait 3-4 hours for the price. The fees are so excessive the agent warmed me ahead of time. I was charged 3 times the amount i paid, on top of what I paid. The ticket only states that rebooking they will recalculate fees so that leaves them free to charge what they want. I could have booked a cheaper ticket on the spot going to Expedia but then they were going to cancel my return flight and I was returning with my friend which was already there. We were returning together. I tried to avoid the fees but in the end they control the situation. I understand fees but basically I was overcharged and nothing I could do. The service is very poor. The flight attendants are curious, food is awful, entertainment if it works, is poor same movies on the return flight. The web site is also very primitive with google translation from Chinese. In addition, the return flight was from a small Chinese city, none of the agents speak English, not helpful. This airline is not customer oriented and not up to par with Star Alliance airlines. I do not recommend the airline, very unprofessional and not helpful to customers. There are plenty of other airlines.",Detractor
I took Vueling from Barcelona to Paris and back. I was concerned after reading negative reviews but my experience was completely positive. Check in was smooth and fast.

As it was a 10.30 am flight breakfast was served, a shriveled up omelet and two small pieces of smoked turkey, a fruit salad with cottage cheese. Bread roll and croissant as well. The poorest breakfast I have been served on a flight in business class. I find it very strange that the food they served out of Cairo did not reflect Greek wonderful cuisine.

I finally asked at the gate from the Frontier Airlines staff how am I going to manage all this, staff said, you get nothing because the problem with the flight is due to bad weather.

"Currently on my fifth round trip with Garuda Indonesia and I wouldn't keep coming back if they weren't good. In fact, I find them to offer an overall excellent service in their Business Class where the seating configuration is 1x2x1 and I always request a window seat which is always allocated. The No.1 Lounge in Gatwick fails to meet my expectations sadly and the Garuda Lounge in Jakarta leaves a lot to be desired in the way of drinks on offer. Late at night when the homeward GA088 departs, food offerings in the lounge can be fairly basic. All of my flights however have been excellent with y friendly and professional crew members. I wish I could join this flight in Amsterdam using the KLM (SkyTeam) CityHopper service but for some strange reason the alliance isn't making my travel easier! I'm looking forward to my homeward flights in three weeks time and will soon be booking the same flights for my January trip here to Jakarta.

My flight was scheduled to depart at 13:20 but I arrived at the airport a bit late, at 12:30. The agents at the counter were really helpful and to my surprise the check-in process was fast. After checking in, I asked the China Southern staff to help me go through the security, and that only took me 3 minutes. The boarding hadn't started yet when I got to the boarding gate, and when the boarding began it was smooth.

"First time flying Delta. Cabin crew were very friendly and attentive. Food was average. Cabin door closed on time, but waited about half an hour before we left the ground, still arrived on time. Overall the flight was better than average except for the seat. I was in premium economy and when you recline the seat back, the seat itself also moves forward. This initially seemed like a nice reclined position. However with no foot rest, this position created severe strain on my low back, and gave me a backache. I thought it was a fluke. However the same thing happened on the return flight. I loathe taking extra paraphenilia on a plane for ""flight comfort"" but you might need to consider lumbar support for long haul flights on this plane.

"  New York to Ha Noi via Hong Kong. I had a very bad experience at the Check In counter. They refused to board me because I didn't have a transit visa in Vancouver (my final destination was Ha Noi, I just transit in Vancouver), which they should have warned me about. When I asked why didn't you warn us that we need a transit visa, the lady working at the Check In counter said this: ""I blame you for not knowing this piece of information"". But who would have known we (me and my friend) would need a visa just to transit in Vancouver for 2 hours? Apparently we are not the only ones who were refused to board because of this reason. As a result, we had to pay 200$ each person to go on a different plane. They put us a ""Wait list"" because all the flights were over-booked for 2 weeks. So we had to stay and sleep at the airport and luckily they let us board after 18 hours. Other than that, the food was good.",Passive
"  I've flown countless times on what I've heard to be the worst airlines while in the marine corps, never really cared about comfort or TVs. Anyways I'm a veteran now flying with a car seat and a 7 month baby that I couldn't even comfort because they separated my family. This was the first and last time flying Frontier. Between last minute check-in bag fees and the treatment we received I felt I had to leave a review. Never flew on a plane that felt unsafe as soon as we took off. I stood awake my entire flight from California to Florida because the seats could not recline. The plane had no TVs for children, no free refreshments, small seats, barely any leg room, stiff hard chairs, rude staff and dirty bathrooms. We brought a car seat onto the plane and after 80% of people loaded we finally started to board and set up the car seat with two crying babies. Then we were told the car seat had to go in a window seat but I didn't have a window seat so it took them about 15 mins to find someone to move us to a seat with a window only to separate my family so the baby can be seated with his mom while I sat on another row. Last but not least out of all the airlines I've been to they always allow mothers or parents with car seats to get situated first so they can have time to set up the car seat but the rude flight attendant said ""I understand but we need you to sit down and buckle your seatbelt"".",Detractor
It's a Dreamliner on this Addis Abeba to Shanghai route. Feeling happy for I love flying on the 787! This 10 hour flight has a roomy 2-2-2 configuration in business class. Although the flat beds are angled I was so exhausted that I slept well. The ground operations at the airport were completely disorganized so was happy to see that the staff onboard were much more collected. Had a great meal. Actually interesting choice of meals on this flight. While other airlines would have served a dinner and breakfast on a 10-hour overnight flight Ethiopian Airlines chose dinner and lunch combo. Two hearty meals. I like it for I was very hungry. Especially when they rolled out a tray of assorted Ethiopian specialities. Yummy! The IFE seemed to work well although with a very limited selection of movies. I also love the uniforms and branding of Ethiopian Airlines. The female uniforms are traditional - and the corporate colours very bright. Nearly fluorescent pink yellow and green. After a few flights with them I have to say they are excellent in the air but a total mess on the ground! Shame for they have a lot of potential.,Promoter
"  Toronto to Dublin return, and I was dreading flying with Air Canada rouge because of bad reviews, but I have never been so presently surprised. We flew premium economy as I had used some air miles. Everything was smooth, from check in to landing. The staff were lovely, the food was seriously some of the best airline food I've had. The seats were spacious and free iPad's provided for Premium Economy. I had specified that I wanted a Vegetarian meal, when the hostesses got to me they told me I could take the vegetarian option on the menu, or there was a specially prepared meal for me. On the way out from Toronto to Dublin I went for the specially prepared meal and had some sort of sweet potato curry with salad and a cheesecake. On the return flight the menu option which was a sun-dried tomato lasagne with pine nuts and olives, with salad and a lemon tart sounded too good to miss. The attendants were quick whenever a drink was requested and very polite. I would happily fly Air Canada rouge again, even in Economy class. Depending on the price difference I would opt for Premium due to the complimentary beverages, queue jump, wide comfy seats and leg room.",Promoter

BNE-HKG-BNE in Premium Economy (and then to Hanoi on Hong Kong Airlines for a change). Cathay Premium Economy never seems to vary: good food good service passable wine (albeit in a plastic cup) and quite good seating. A negative is that the Cathay Pacific web-site often shows premium economy as being already completely full when looking at potential flights and selecting seats when in fact it isn't full at all. I wonder how many customers Cathay are losing because of this. They've lost me this time because of this odd problem and I will head to Hong Kong and back on Qantas next time.

EK 313 and EK 312 - 17th Feb and 22nd Feb 2014. I've done 2 flights in the last week with Emirates 1 in Business and 1 in Economy and I have to say it's been very hit and miss with the service and food served. The Economy flight DXB to Tokyo and the return was in Business. Funny thing was the Economy journey was better reasonable food and service. The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. The seats I found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around.

The aircraft was spotlessly clean and the cabin crew thoroughly professional (particularly in relation to safety checks) and courteous. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that despite being only 90 minute mid-morning flight, a complimentary cooked meal with choice of dishes and drinks was served and cleared away in the short time available. All this for a fare that would make the cheapest European budget airline seem somewhat expensive. Sadly few foreign tourists are visiting Kashmir these days, so the flight was very much geared for Indian nationals having cause to fly to/from Delhi, but can only conclude that with two rival Indian arilines operating this route, competition really is driving up standards.

"airBaltic was let down on this flight by the totally unprofessional ground handling agents at gate D2 this afternoon.

Having been Cabin Crew myself, I know that it takes minutes to turn an aircraft around and do a crew change. The gate staff gave misinformation to flyers which in my book is a big no no. There were an American Family who were flying from Heathrow later this evening and others who wanted to let people meeting them know that the flight was going to be late but the gate staff did not care less. The answers that were given ranged from the aircraft is not here yet to the aircraft will be in London at 5pm. The aircraft crew were first class and professional both the cockpit and cabin crew apologised for the delay. The service was slick and professional. The Cabin menu is tasty and fresh. The coffee tasted like coffee rather than the lukewarm water on some airlines offer.

We flew London to Quebec via Montreal and poor service began before we boarded the flight. We checked in online selected our seats printed our boarding passes checked our luggage in and when we got to the gate they told us we could no longer sit in our allocated seats. We specifically requested the seats as we were travelling with an infant. On the plane the seats are cramped the cabin staff generally unhelpful and rude insisting we take our full meal service even though we had an infant on our lap. As it was it didn't matter as the food was of a very poor standard. The inflight entertainment system clunky and limited choice the touch screen system not working effectively meant passengers behind constantly banging the screens and your seats trying to get the system to work. No seat belts are provided for infants either for take off or landing. This is an airline that seems to be operating a decade behind most others. I will never fly with them again.

"I was travelling easyJet from Madrid to Edinburgh to attend a wedding reception straight from the flight, so was carrying only 1 carry on trolley case (within required dimensions). I queued up very early (only a few passengers in front of me) to ensure I got onboard fastly and I could put my bag in. When I reached the door of the plane the ground staff tried to snatch the bag from me but I asked why as the overhead lockers were empty - I explained I was going straight to a wedding reception and that my dress was at the top of my case ironed and ready to put on and this is why I had a seat and the front of the plane and queued early - they were kind and understood and told me to speak to the crew. I then encountered a very smug crew who didn't want to know about my need or wouldn't explain why my bag was being offloaded when it was still empty - he said it was a full flight but surely it's first come first served for baggage space? To which he sang with a big smile on his face ""you have agreed to the terms and conditions when you bought the ticket, so if you don't like it please leave!"" I was in shock of this and had to ask again to make sure I heard right - asking me to leave because I had asked why I couldn't put it there when it was empty - absolutely no empathy or warmth and seemed to take pleasure from it and made eyes with another crew. He then instructed them to remove my bag and wasn't asked if I needed to take anything from it - I later realised I was left without money or my motion sickness medication and didn't feel comfortable to ask if my bag could be retrieved due to the unapproachable crew - this made the flight miserable. The captain did make a PA to apologise for offloaded bags after landing which was professional, so was it too much for the crew to use his discretion and be human or atleast apologise for the situation also?!",Passive
"  Flew Singapore Airlines from Melbourne to Singapore. Departure airport was quiet that day due to industry-wide strike. Anticipating delay and congestion, somehow I checked-in and cleared custom in a breeze, which was quite a surprise. Orderly boarding accompanied by cabin crews repeated welcomes, no one has rushed and despite the rear cabin being full, it remained quiet throughout the journey. I had prepaid extra for the Preferred Seat 48A on-board the new A350 with almost unlimited leg room - there's no seat in-front, thus moving in or out of the seat without disturbing fellow passengers alone was worth paying extra for. However, the seat does come with its own design flaws. Once the PTV is pulled up, it physically creates a wall in between 48A and 48B, not only reducing 48B's already limited personal space, it also made plugging in USB charger an additional hassle. Furthermore, reduced seat width and immovable armrest are just another two trade-offs if extra leg room is preferred. Nevertheless, the amount of seat recline did appear adequately generous. The flight took about 7 hours, there were two meals served - one dinner and another light meal. The size and taste of its meals have noticeably deteriorated over the years, e.g., the size of the tray has been reduced significantly, just to name one. I found the IFE content rich and diverse, especially the music library - I enjoy listening to music while watching the moving-maps. I didn't use the WiFi, thus unable to comment. The flight attendants patrolled the cabin two to three times between meals with professional manner and meticulous grooming. All in all, this flight demonstrated Singapore Airlines high standard of service.",Promoter
"My husband and I were on a quick trip to Syracuse. His grandmother was in poor health and given weeks left. We flew in on a Friday evening without incident with a return flight beginning on Sunday afternoon from Syracuse to Philadelphia to Wilmington NC. We were left a message at 1145pm on Saturday night that our flight was cancelled. Luckily, we had been up to receive the message and called back 15 minutes later. The American Airlines representative my husband talked to looked for another flight out of Syracuse for about 15 seconds, told him there were none and insisted that we had to drive to Buffalo or Albany if we wanted to fly out Sunday. We were given no explanation for the cancelled flight and the representative refused to look again for any flights out of Syracuse unless we went out Monday instead. So we inquired about a Rochester flight which was our closest option and booked one. Having jobs we had to get back to. My father in law drove us to and from Rochester. Then our flight was delayed because of weather. I understand some things are out of people's control, buy this is the 3rd time we have experienced our flight through Philadelphia being cancelled, being called very late, and having to inconvenience family members. No more quick weekend trips for us.",Detractor
"  On my first flight from Manila to Taipei the agent at the counter in Manila was kind enough to upgrade me to premium economy at no cost. During my second flight from Manila to New York JFK I was in the regular economy cabin. Being this my first experience with EVA I was not sure what to expect but I booked because their 5 star rating here. During my first flight (Manila to Taipei - 2hrs) I received a hot meal (rice, meat, and vegetables), fresh fruit, a hot roll with butter, cake, wine, juice and water. No US carrier provides a meal like that on a two hour flight unless you are in business class or above. During my second flight (Manila to NYC - 14hrs) I received two hot meals (rice, meat, shrimp, vegetables, and pasta) fresh fruit, hot rolls with butter, dessert, wine, juice, water, snacks and 2 ham and cheese sandwiches. That is what I chose from the menu that we had in economy. Yes they hand you a menu with multiple choices and it's also displayed on the interactive screen you have in front of you. Their interactive entertainment choices are decent however for the 14 hour flight a more ample selection of movies would have been nice. The bathrooms in the economy cabin were equipped with amenities like you find in the business cabin bathrooms. Soap, lotion, body mist, facial mist, toothbrush, and sleeping masks were available in the bathrooms. On your chair you found a very nice and comfortable pillow with a blanket plus over the headphones. Next time I fly EVA I will book the premium economy cabin because the seat is extremely comfortable, double patted and a bit wider. (I'm 180lbs. 5'9"") plus they separate the cabin with curtains giving you the feeling of a less crowded space. The seat in the regular economy cabin was comfortable however any seat that you spend 14 hours on at some point will become uncomfortable and I found myself having to stand multiple times during the flight. I had an aisle seat. My only observation as constructive feedback would be that even though everyone onboard smiled, happiness must appear to be genuine and that genuine feeling was not properly transmitted by the flight attendants. On the other hand I must say that they worked extremely fast, efficiently, and professional. I flew the Boeing 777-300ER for both flights and I have to say that it was not as quiet as the Boeing 787 and both planes while clean had signs of wear and tear. I definitely recommend EVA Air over any US based airline for the economy traveler.",Promoter

I was at SFO for 16 hours I had to pay $75 to grab another flight even though I paid $950 for 2 one-way flights just 24 hours prior. American customer service team members were the worst, they must train them to have a blank face and not care at all. The counter reps in SFO all could care less about helping at all.

Second (DOH-HKG) on Sep 23, very good meals, good flight entertainment, on time, big remark on the Spanish attendants, very helpful and polite, specially a girl who treated us like VIP customers. I dont give a 5 star for the following reason, my luggage arrived broken! Went to the office in HK and they forced me to take 500HKD (54EUROS) for my bag, otherwise I needed to wait 2 weeks to get the money back in France.

First leg was a overnight flight and sitting in seat 20k in 4 class configuration it was impossible to sleep due to the constant vibration of the engine with the seat being directly above the wing. Return journey was in seat 16k in 3 class configuration and was much quieter. Food was pretty poor standard on both legs for business class, not worth the premium paid. Also on the return flight I requested a burger from the order as you wish range, however half way through the 12 hour flight the cabin staff were already out of them.

"  Jakarta to Berlin via Abu Dhabi and Belgrade, I was looking forward to enjoy a pleasant flight. The first flight from Jakarta to Abu Dhabi was an Etihad operated flight, the last two flights were Air Serbia operated flights. For those, who do not know Air Serbia: Etihad owns 49% of that airline and manages it. The first flight was a night flight, departing 0:10 am. My seat was not reclining as it should. It was going back to normal position, when I leaned forward a little. The flight attendant confirmed that the seat has a defect, and told me, she would try to find a solution. Well, nothing happened, not even a feedback. After 23 hours of travelling with Etihad (including waiting times at the airports), I was about to start my final flight to Berlin at Belgrade on time. While waiting in the airplane I fell asleep, just to wake up 20 min. after regular departure time, because of the pilot's announcement: All passengers would need to leave the airplane due to a technical error. Then, we needed to wait, without knowing, what would happen next. This took around 3 hours. The airline provided water and apple juice for free but no information. Then, the flight was cancelled. The ground staff told us, that we would get new tickets immediately and after that we would stay in a hotel to catch our new flight connection on the next day. What they did not tell us: Everybody would need to wait until all new tickets are issued. No option to buy food is available at that part of the airport. After that, we would be transfered directly to the hotel. This happened another 2 hours later. While waiting for the new tickets to be issued and in the bus for the other passengers whose tickets have not been issued yet, no food was provided. So 5.30 hours after the regular departure time, I was checking in at the hotel. It was 11.40 pm local time and they were about to pick me up at 4 am the next day, so that I could catch my flight in the morning at 6.35 am. At the hotel we were finally provided a food bag, with a sandwich in it, an apple, drinkable yoghurt and chocolate mousse...The hotel kitchen was closed already...too late. The spa was also closed by the way. Well, I did not get any sleep that night, because I was so afraid of missing my next flight, because I was super tired. All in all, the way I was treated as a customer was semi-professional. I would probably choose a different airline next time.",Detractor

" This is a review of two connecting flights through Dublin. The first flight from ZÃ¼rich to Dublin on an Airbus 320 was truly bare bones in terms of in-flight service. No complimentary snacks or drinks (not even water) and no in-flight entertainment of any sort. Duty free items were available for sale but the choices were very limited. Cockpit announcements traced the flight route. The flight from Dublin to New York JFK left on time and arrived at the gate in Terminal 5 over 30 minutes ahead of schedule. With immigration and customs checks for the U.S. having been done at Dublin - I just disembarked out of the plane and walked out of the airport as if it was a domestic flight. No duty free shopping is available on U.S. bound flights from Dublin as customs clearance is done by U.S. Customs in Dublin itself. On this flight a full dinner was served with choice of a beef or chicken - no vegetarian - option. Soft drinks, tea and coffee are complimentary but not beer, liquor or wine. A small but decent selection of movies was available on the individual back of the seat entertainment system. - I was able to watch two movies on this relatively short flight of less than seven hours. Flight attendants were friendly. Too many announcements, even for a fleeting turbulence, was annoying and interruptive. Leg space was tight and when seats were reclined it was a challenge to watch a movie, read a book or eat your meal. Good value for traveling from ZÃ¼rich to New York though, obviously, it took much longer.",Passive

25 November Zurich ZRH-Berlin TXL LX970 / 29 November Berlin TXL-Zurich ZRH LX971. The outbound flight arrived on time seat comfort was very good and there was a very frendly and competent cabin crew at work. The return flight arrived about 25 minutes late (rush hour at TXL) but the standards of comfort and cabin crew were equally good. But the overall feeling was not very inviting and quite annoying because both flights (Airbus A321) were more or less full. There were lots of business travellers with huge carry on luggage lots of heavy jackets because of winter time and yes boarding and deboarding an Airbus A321 through only one door takes a long time. But I am not going to blame Swiss for that elsewhere I would have had the same experience. I paid EUR 180 for the ticket which is a good fare from my point of view. I will definitely consider Swiss again. Zurich airport is very efficient and passenger friendly while it is good that Berlin TXL is going to be replaced.

Also note most of their gates at airports are not actual gates but landing on the runway with transfer by bus. This can take extra hassle and time to board and exit the plane. If you need any deal of extra customer service expect nothing beyond standard email replies and frowns. Front desk agents not particularly happy to be there.

We were travelling with our daughter of 2 years on a vacation trip. The benefits were obvious, especially when travelling with a little, impatient child - you'll learn to love the fast lane, the lounge (even though the one in PMI is quite disappointing, but it is run by the airport itself and used for every airline), and the priority luggage service (which I never noticed on business trips, as I only had carry-on luggage). We loved the quiet atmosphere in the well booked business class compartment - our daughter had two seats on her own to take a nap almost throughout the entire flight. Service and food onboard were professional and friendly. The surcharge when booking a non flexible business class ticket compared to the available economy tickets was well worth the benefits. Will definitely book Lufthansa BC again next year.",Promoter
ICN-KIX-ICN: two short flights. First leg on a A333 and the second was on a B772. Both of the times the cabin crew responded politely to all calls made and smiled. The seat was alright. However the food was terrible. Only one choice was given both ways. To KIX was some kind of eel with rice. It just looked so bad. From KIX was a sandwich and was worse than ones that stores in Korea sell for $.99. My AVOD had to be reset but no problem the crew did it within five minutes and apologized when they did not have to. Both flights arrived early.,Promoter
" London Heathrow to Los Angeles. I have heard several different things about United's long-haul product, so I didn't know what to expect. Whatever expectations I did have on United's long-haul product were exceeded. Due to the fact that it was a flight to the United States, we had to go through additional security checks and ""recheck-in"" at a United service counter. It was a quick and efficient process. Our flight departed Heathrow thirty minutes past the scheduled time. The flight was nearly full, and I had a window seat on this flight. The seat configuration on the 787 was a 3-3-3. Once in the air, a refreshments service occurred, which was followed by lunch. There were two options: chicken or pasta. I opted for the pasta, and it was pretty decent. It came with some sort of grain and corn salad, as well as a bread roll, butter, cheese and crackers. It was a good portion of food. The United Economy seat was very comfortable with heaps of legroom by economy standards. It is made of leather and reclines relatively far back. The inflight entertainment was outstanding, with plenty of choices and a very modern and responsive touchscreen. The seat was also fully wired with a headphone jack, a USB port and a power outlet below the seat. In addition, I would definitely recommend flying on the 787 because the windows are much larger and darken at the touch of a button. The inflight service was okay, not up to par with Lufthansa or Austrian. Although it was a day flight, I got four hours of sleep with the blanket and pillow provided, both very comfortable. Before arrival we were served a warm turkey sandwich, as well as fresh fruit, chips and a cookie. All of it was delicious, especially the fruit, which was a nice touch. We landed in Los Angeles 18 minutes before scheduled arrival. Overall, United's hard product (the seat and entertainment) are outstanding, however their service needs a little work. I would recommend United Airlines and I certainly look forward to flying them again.",Promoter
"4 flights on Ethiopian Airlines. My flights were Washington to Nairobi thru Addis Ababa and returned the same way. The flight over appeared to be a fairly new plane and quite comfortable. I am 6' 4"" and found the legroom adequate. It helped that the seat next to me was empty. The food was typical airline food (rather nondescript). I found the cabin staff fairly attentive. The plane to Nairobi and was much older and the consensus among my travelling companions that had the flight been longer than the two hours it would have been unbearable as the seats were old and uncomfortable. The return flight was comparable to trip going over. Once again the seat next to me was empty for the 15 or 16 hr flight. I agree with other reviewers about the lack of cleanliness in the bathrooms. This appears to be a shortcoming of the staff. I was underwhelmed by the counter staff both going and coming - it was apparent that they could care less about customer service. Overall my experience with the airline was good and I would fly them again. I did not find the airport in Addis Ababa to be a problem as other reviewers have.",Passive
LHR-Bilbao return. T3 departure was (exactly) on time for departure and arrival. Least eventful flight ever. Did what a short haul should do. BA Silver don't have lounge access Gold only.

  Worst flying experience I've ever had. Our first flight was delayed so we had to completely reschedule all our connecting flights. We made it to Houston to wait for our next flight and after waiting 2 hours our flight was delayed another 3 hours. After 8 delays/times changes for our flight and 7 hours of sitting in the airport all they did to help us was give us a $10 voucher. We asked about the delays to try to figure out what was going on and see if there was another option. We were responded to very rudely and disrespectfully any time a question was asked and were not given any sort of response besides â€œcan't help youâ€. I will never be flying United again.,Detractor
" Edinburgh to Amsterdam. At Edinburgh airport, quick check-in and security. Boarding on time, departure also on time. Friendly crew. Told them I was not feeling well due to a chronic lung condition (have a FREMEC card). They immediately made aware and made a note. During the flight all went well. I found a diamond ring on the floor in front of me and handed it over to the purser. He checked for the person sitting in that row on the previous flight immediately to make sure that they could give the item back. The flight itself was short. The crew managed service in a breeze, Always friendly and smiling, the purser recognised me from previous flights (I am a flying blue platinum member). After landing and finally at the gate (which at Schiphol can take up to 15 minutes) everyone stood up. The family in front of me was apparently in a hurry, getting out all the hand luggage with a rush, even hitting me on the head, and the placing it even on the seats around them including mine. When walking out of the plane and being at the gate I realised that I left my iPad on my seat. But I was not allowed to go back. They told me that ""they will collect it for you"" and I had to go to ""lost and found"". There they told me to fill in an electronic document and within five days they would notify me. Well, after five days I received a message that the iPad had not been found and that they could not help me any further. What a pity, I mean I was less than a fewyards out of the plane and not even half of the passengers had left the plane so I could easily had picked it up. But on the other hand I understand that ""rules are rules"". Overall, the flight itself and the service provided were really good and that is why I love to fly KLM.",Promoter
"Disgusted with the way we have been treated by Norwegian. Our flight was cancelled and there was no explanation as to why. We were in the airport for 4 hrs before being told of the cancellation and then we were herded like cattle to a bus which took us to a hotel an hour away from the airport. At 11.30 that night we were told that they couldn't accommodate us with flights home and we would have to do everything ourselves in the morning. We then had to pay to get back to Malaga airport where we were told that unfortunately Norwegian couldn't help us and we had to buy another flight from another airline. Of course my husband and I couldn't afford to buy a new flight, so after a few cross words we were offered a hotel for another night only and they would try and get us a flight. We were given a number to call for assistance and guess what, all was spoken in Norwegian. We are now in to a 24hr delay and still don't know how or when we are going home.",Detractor

Travelled from Lima to Madrid on Iberia August 3rd. I was really dreading this flight as I had heard so many horrible things about Iberia and the thought of a 12+ hour flight with no personal entertainment system was slightly terrifying. I think a lot of their long-haul routes must still be with older aircraft with very poor amenities judging from the reviews but the A340 I flew on looked like it was right out of the factory and had one of the best entertainment systems I have ever come across in an economy cabin. The food was completely up to standard compared with BA or AF and the staff perfectly courteous and attentive. I'd still be wary to travel with Iberia long-haul as it seems there is no minimum level of guaranteed service across their fleet but this flight was extremely pleasant. This airline is on the right track!,Promoter

"AC1837 on May 5. Has anyone actually had a good Rouge experience. Mine certainly wasn't. I paid the full AC fare for a Rouge flight from YYZ to PHX (the only direct flight option) and sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours while they tried to decide how to resolve their ""technical issues"". 3 hrs spent in a cramped seat working on a too-close tray table without a power source for my laptop. The end result was de-planning and then fending for ourselves to make alternative travel arrangements. Rouge did not cancel the flight - it took off 9 hrs after its originally scheduled departure. Basically Rouge is like a discount charter vacation service at full service prices with few planes available so if something goes wrong with yours prepare to camp out there's no back- up.

MAD-SVQ-MAD was with Iberia Express with much better and more enthusiastic crew and no service as on low cost airlines and frankly I prefer that since you do not get bothered with the whole meal and service show.

"  I was delayed 7 hours on the flight out due to a faulty plane, the delay after horrendous queues at the check in area (due to no working check in machines - online or at the airport, and too few staff).

The price was incredible, I honestly couldn't believe the deal I got on this flight, however, once I flew the first leg I understood why it was so cheap.

My major complaint is on the ride home. I got to the airport early, and then found out that my flight was delayed 30 minutes, which was no big deal, it's only 30 minutes. However, it got delayed 2 more times for a total of 4 hours. I walked up to the clerk and asked about rescheduling my flight, and found out it would be 24 hours for the next flight because they only have 1 flight a day that goes to Raleigh. Luckily I have family in the area and I stayed with them overnight. The next day I get to the airport and find out that my flight is delayed again.

" Guangzhou to Shanghai. Customer Service is woeful. Unfortunately, I have to regularly fly with this airline so I became a member of the Eastern Miles Club in order that I could accrue some points. I didn't want the points so much as recognition for the flights. Because I am a westerner, I am almost always get placed up the back of the plane with the other westerners. So, I thought, if they recognise me after all these flights, I might move to the front. For the last 3 months, I have had a new passport (a renewal). We are not allowed to update our accounts with the passport number, we need to call the hotline. I called the hotline and they told me helpfully to email the details to their help desk. I emailed the help desk and they told me I need to call the hotline. And so it goes, back and forth, neither party willing to do anything at all beyond what they want to do or need to do. After 7 emails, with the same request, I am frustrated and stuck. They wont upgrade the passport number and they wont recognise the points. I cant â€œstart againâ€ because that would mean buying a new mobile phone number. When flying with them, could someone please advise the airline that airline issued earphones plugged into their entertainment system, does not affect flight controls. With religious fervor, literally 30 -40 mins before we land, everything is cleared and closed. No phones, no headphones, no entertainment, no kindles - nothing. Sit still and read Chinese Duty Free magazines. Ground staff at check in - very business like, process bound and perfunctory. They remind me every time, what I am about to face over the next few hours. Generally speaking, I have found cabin staff good.

" London to Baltimore via Keflavik. This airline keeps getting worse and worse. For a few years, they offered the cheapest flights from the DC area to London. You had to deal with 1. No free food/drink (not even water) 2. A short stopover in Iceland (I actually prefer this) 3. Extreme limitation on carry-on, and big fees if you do not comply. I learned to bring water/food the hard way, I learned to bring a small bag the hard way. These are in your control as an inmate on WOW air. Unfortunately, not much else is. On my 3rd or 4th (and last) flight, the bag I always took for free suddenly no longer qualified. This was a surprise to me, and as there was a big checkin line behind me, I kind of panicked and paid the fee of 50+ pounds that brought the total cost above competitors (WOW has been getting less competitive, and is no longer always the cheapest option, even without extra fees). Before boarding, I consolidated my luggage, rechecked in and was told I could be refunded via the website. The only contact on the website is an email. They were quick to respond to my email, but just with a cookie-cutter 'we do not offer refunds' - depite what I was told. I re-explained the situation and soon they just stopped replying. There is no phone number on the website, I later got it on my return journey when checkin attendant opened a safe, and ripped off a number from a sheet with the number written on it like 50 times - like some kind of interest flyer. I called them and the phone operator was just as impossible to deal with - no refunds, despite the fact that I rechecked in and was told I could get one. At the end, he told me to have a 'wow day.' This seems trivial compared to what other reviewers have had to deal with. This airline grew due to being legitimately cheap, but now that they have become a big player they A. are becoming almost as expensive, while retaining all the extra expenses and B.

I have flown this airline (on the way to Ukraine) twice in the past. This time I flew to Frankfurt Germany. Each time has been progressively worse. Every flight was delayed beginning with my flight out of Huntsville and on each connecting flight. One time they said it was some latch was broken or something to do with the luggage conveyor belt to load the suitcases into the airplane. Another time someone forgot to turn the AC on in the airplane and it was 90 degrees inside (it was a hot day). Each delay was at least an hour. The flight attendants were rude and quick tempered. They snapped at myself and other passengers I observed on more than one occasion. They seemed to always be in a rush and as I was sitting in an aisle seat I was rudely bumped into by one of them as they flew by. No apologies were made. Oh and the service was usually late and the food was of questionable quality as well. In short it was such a miserable experience it almost made my trip to Germany not worth it. The seats on the 747 were so jam packed together I always felt squashed into the neighboring passenger. Their computers were broken at the airport and so there was another half hour delay getting through customs was horrible enough on my return trip but dealing with United's mess was just reprehensible.,Detractor

"  Gatwick to Bangkok via Istanbul. The arrival experience could be stepped up slightly. There really isn't much of a welcome when you first arrive on board. It takes a while for you to be offered a drink and for a business class traveller, I didn't get any service really throughout the whole flight. There was on both legs of the flight a few moody staff members. The seat itself is really good. Lay flat beds, however you do have to get up to allow them to put the thin mattress down, but the choice is yours. Meals are good. They are better than many other airlines I have travelled on. The only suggestion would be that the breakfast could be improved slightly. Main course and dessert are really good for airline food. I did once have a hot chocolate and that will be something I never have again. Inflight entertainment offers a limited selection. They could be more up to date movies. Wifi is a good addition too. The whole situation about not being able to take a laptop onboard from Istanbul to London was a right hassle. Chaotic and wasn't controlled well. No signage. People didn't know where they were going, didn't know they had to queue or that they had to have their bags checked again before going to the gate. Check in counter is separate for business class passengers but this is where it ends. When you get to the gateyes they call you up first. But if you are running late, there isn't a clear lane in IST for you to board. Overall I will continue to fly Turkish Airlines as they offer a really good service for a really good price. I can let the attention they don't provide to the customers go, but it does need to be addressed. There also doesn't seem to be anything available to snack on in-between meals.

We purchased extra services - such as priority boarding, which was not provided - we were all squeezed into a bus. The driver was not present, the engine was off, the heating was off - we were left waiting outside for 20 minutes (I am in my mid 20s, I was fine standing, but what about elderly passengers?) on a freezing cold bus. Let me point out, the flight is at 6.20 in the morning, so the outside temperature is below freezing. There were no staff at the bus who we could have raised our concerns with. While boarding the staff did not care about maintaining lines / queues / checking priority boarding details, we paid extra and had to queue behind a whole bunch of people without PB to eventually be squeezed into a cold bus. This wasn't my first time flying Wizz, my overall opinion is that the Staff at the airports are not motivated at all - I would even say that they could not care less about the passengers. The organisation of the boarding process is awful, we were met with a rude attitude - especially from the ground handling staff. Obviously this is a low-cost airline, so you are prepared to have some inconveniences, such as small leg room, extreme departure times, ridiculous baggage policies etc. I have flown with Wizz 5 times in the past 18 months - as it is the only direct flight between Glasgow and Budapest, however after the horrific experience last time we have decided to fly KLM via Amsterdam. Would like to point out, the cost is the same, or even cheaper, considering the same hand luggage allowance and the lay over is just about 2 hours at Schiphol. Will be looking to avoid Wizz in the future.",Detractor
I flew DXB-DOH and on the same day DOH-DXB back. Of course you can't expect a service like from Qatar Airways or Emirates which both operate this route. But the price is just great. Because it was a short-haul flight we were allowed to use the inflight-entertainment system for free. Food and drinks are for purchase but its a no-frills airline. The Inflight entertainment was as I said complimentary on this flight. We had a personal inflight TV in our seat and a huge collection of movies in many languages. I was able to watch movies in German. I would absolutely recommend this airline!,Promoter
"Chose Aer Lingus primarily due to low fare compared to more established airlines which fly Germany to the USA. You have to pay for your beer or wine. Otherwise, the on-board service was top and the food quality very good. Economy seats had more legroom than many other airlines. However, the main advantage is going through US Immigration in Dublin and landing domestic at terminal 5 at JFK New York. In my previous experience, immigration in NY or SFO often means standing in line for up to 2 hours.",Promoter
CBR (QF to PER) to MAD Via PER and DOH. This is the second time I have flown Qatar and again was very pleased with the result. All check in staff courteous and helpful. Cabin staff very helpful. Food was simple but very good. Seat was particularly wide for Economy 18.9 inches I think and legroom and recline good. I never sleep well but the cabin and seating gave me the best chance it could in a fairly crowded economy class.

"Las Vegas to London Heathrow return, and we did not have a good experience with British Airways. Both flights were incredibly hot and stuffy, unlike anything I've ever experienced flying on any other airline. I tend to run cold and usually need a sweater on planes, but I was uncomfortably hot the whole time. My husband and some of the other passengers sitting near me also commented on how stuffy it was. The staff on our return flight were rude to passengers and nice only to a select few. I definitely got the impression that you are either a have or a have not with this airline, and if you're a have not then don't even bother expecting any courtesies from the staff. The people sitting next to me had a complaint and it took 3 hours for a staff member to address them. On our return flight, we asked about paying to upgrade our seats but were told it was a full flight and we wouldn't be able to because some passengers were receiving complimentary upgrades and others were being downgraded. I thought it was odd that they would be giving free upgrades if it meant downgrading passengers who had paid for better seats, but what was even more odd was that some passengers didn't know they'd been downgraded until they got on the plane! A group of passengers got on the plane and went to their seats only to find that they weren't the economy plus seats they'd paid for and reserved - they were regular coach seats. They had all the paperwork showing that they'd paid for economy plus, so this wasn't an error on their part. They were told it was a full flight and they could get off the plane if they wanted. A couple of passengers in this group were elderly and had paid for economy plus because an elderly lady in the group had a medical condition with her blood circulation so she needed the extra leg room. This poor old lady had to spend at least half the 10 hour flight standing in the aisle. The boarding process in Las Vegas was smooth, but boarding at Heathrow was a joke. The staff only made one announcement, and must not have had their speaker turned on because it was barely audible. As a result, no one knew where they were supposed to go and people were standing in the wrong lines and basically all over the place. It made boarding take forever. The entertainment selection was sub par for such a long flight. A few decent movies but not much else. I thought the food was decent and they served plenty of food and drinks for the flight.",Detractor

No individual screens for movies, on the Madrid to JFK flight thy served awful food - they had nuts and chocolate bars that of course you have to pay for. Then their credit card machine was not working so they had to write down the credit card info to charge us later on. The aircraft was old and poorly maintained.

"Geneva to Tokyo via Moscow with Aeroflot. My flight from Geneva to Moscow was 1.5 hours late, when I had 1.5 hours transit in Moscow, meaning I landed when my connecting flight was about to take off. I knew about the very short transit, therefore consulted the cabin attendant when I found out that the flight was delayed. To which I was told the connecting flight would wait for me and I would be guided to business class just before landing so that I could get off the flight early, in which case the transit would be smooth, and there will be ground staff assisting me the transit. All points was a total lie! They could have, and I do have experience with other flights that the departure time is delayed by 30 minutes or so for connecting passengers, however no such arrangement was made. Neither did they allow me to go to the front of the plane. Rather, I was moved twice to the rear end of the plane due to families wanting to sit together. On top of this, none of the ground crew were there to help me at all. Because of this, I was forced into staying 24 hours in Moscow in a hotel arranged by Aeroflot. But this is the crazy part. You stay in an airport hotel in a ""special"" floor where there are security guards so you cannot leave the hotel. You cannot even go to the common area of the hotel without a security guard behind your back. Basically, you are treated as a prisoner!",Detractor

  Dubai to Amritsar via Doha. Flight from Dubai to Doha on A350 was comfortable. Flight Attendant smiling and attentive. Hot Snack Box with OJ is served on this 40 minute flight. Hence a quick busy shuttle flight which landed on time and all was good and efficient. After reaching Doha moved to Departure Hall. Hamad airport is dark and not properly lighten up. Our onward flight to Amritsar was from gate C24 which is on the ground level. The place looks does not provide good travel experience. Boarding started zone wise an hour earlier but still bit chaotic. We are bussed to the aircraft. The aircraft was A321 which is full. The seats were not more than average and feel bit cramped. Refreshing towel pack handed out but no menus were given. Drinks are served with meal but no refill offered. Meal served is not up to 5 star mark and average. It took a long time for flight attendant to serve the meal and to take away trays after finishing the meal. The flight departs at 02:20 am and reaches by 08:15 am. It would be better and appropriate if they serve breakfast on this sector rather than serving dinner. There was a long queue for going to washroom after the meal. The good thing about this flight is that it departed on time and reached on time that too 10 minutes early and inflight entertainment was good.,Passive

"âŒ   KeflavÃ­k to Boston. I don't recommend WOW air at all. Although ticket prices were great, they charge you a bunch of fees and for everything else (a bottle of water was $3.29).

Arriving to the airport I went to the self check kiosk but apparently in KeflavÃ­k they don't open until 12pm. So I went into the baggage line since I need to drop off my bag. An employee finally arrived around 12:22 yelling at everyone that they need to you the kiosk because the line was too big. But the kiosk still didn't work. On the plane itself, the staffs didn't greet anyone but were on their phones. One looked at me asking if I needed help finding my seat, but I told her it's ok, I know where it is, and she told me to stop and show me her ticket because she didn't believe me.

The CAI-JFK was a long slog. Seats were ok in Biz class but IFE was functional but with minimal choice. Food (a breakfast and a lunch) was barely edible and more akin to the mystery meet of coach trips in the 1980's. Was astonished that EgyptAir did not serve alcohol on its planes.

The flight departed on time and onboard service was solid and reliable. For the FRA-BOM segment we were on the upper deck Business Class section of a new B747-8. Lufthansa has dropped the ball in the manner it has configured its new Business Class seats. They are narrow and angled towards your co-passenger in the row - a disaster that could have been avoided if Lufthansa hadn't gone cheap. By way of comparison, ANA's Business Class seat is the gold standard. Despite this disappointment, Lufthansa's reliability, predictability and vast flight network are its strengths.",Passive

" Philadelphia to Managua via Ft Lauderdale. Please never ever fly Spirit. They are awful. Choosing to fly with them ruined my weekend. I bought a ticket roundtrip to Nicaragua. At the airport I need to spend another $990 on two planes tickets with other airlines that would actually take me to Nicaragua. I spent 2 nights in airports and instead of Nicaragua Spirit left me in San Pedro Sula, somewhere I had never been before which google says is the most dangerous city on earth. Spirit Airlines is an organization that only knows how to take your money. This was the worst flight experience of my life. A one stop 7 hour flight 5 day weekend with friends turned into 4 days of flying and 1 day at my destination. We waited by the gate to board in Philadelphia. Thirty minutes prior to departure we asked the Spirit gate agent what time the flight boards. The gate agent told us the flight was closed. That made no sense, one of my fellow passengers told the Spirit gate agent. The gate agent, to my shocked surprise, began cursing at the passenger. No one at the airport could help me. The two gate agents were mean and rude. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with three different customer service agents, none of which spoke English very well. One agent advised me to rent a car and drive from Philadelphia airport to Pittsburgh, to catch a flight leaving about 90 minutes later. Philadelphia is about a 5 hour drive to Pittsburgh. Eventually I found my own way from Philadelphia to my connecting flight in Fort Lauderdale.

" Washington to Bangkok in economy class on a 777. I arrived 70 minutes before the flight, leaving 10 minutes to spare before the official cutoff time. There were three ticket agents and no one else in line. However, there apparently was some debate over who would have to serve me, as no one would check me in. Several times a clock behind the counter was pointed to, and the agents wandered off without acknowledging me. Finally a supervisor asked one of the agents to take care of me. The agent again pointed to the clock (which at this point was still about 7 minutes prior to the cutoff) but the supervisor pointed to the work station and finally I was attended to. On board, the flight crew seemed neglectful, we were pushing back during the safety presentation and there were passengers standing in the aisles. The inflight experience was fine. The seats were comfortable, legroom was adequate, and the cabin was clean, and even economy class gets an amenity kit. The meals were the highlight, with multiple cuisines on offer. An hour of free wifi is included for anyone who pays enough attention to read these things, and the connection speed was truly exceptional. The only complaint about the inflight experience was the headphone jack. If you want to use your own headset, bring a two pronged adapter, or you'll suffer through the adequate but not much-more-than-that headset provided. My second flight was 10 hours after my first, and the Doha Airport is a tragic experience unless you have, or pay for lounge access. or you have a desire to shop for high end luxury brands of clothing and luggage. The connecting flight was just like the first, but with no seat charging options. A bit surprising to not have that option, but the entertainment system was good enough to keep me amused. All in, this was better than my last few experiences on Qatar, and I wouldn't tell friends to avoid them. Just get there earlier than the cutoff, and bring a battery and a headphone adapter.",Passive

" Frankfurt to Goa via Delhi. My wife and I booked a flight from Munich to Goa via Frankfurt and Delhi in Business Class, then after some days from Goa to Kathmandu via Mumbai and the return from Kathmandu to Munich. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt was operated by Lufthansa, the other flights were operated by Air India. The booking was in one ticket. The flight from Munich to Frankfurt with Lufthansa was nice. When it was time for boarding in Frankfurt, Air India could not open the ticket. After a lengthy discussion we were finally allowed to board the aircraft (without boarding passes), which already had some 45 minutes delay due to our issue. Our seats that we reserved months ago were given to other passengers so we had separate seats. The business class seat actually is okay and so was the onboard service. The seat just looked dirty and used. Air India uses a new 787 on this route but they look like old 767 that have been in service for the past 20 years. After all, we were just too frustrated to enjoy them. Once in Delhi, an agent picked us up and escorted us to the gate for our connecting flight which we boarded without a boarding pass. While the Air India representatives in Frankfurt organized that we arrive at our destination, they did not think about our Air India flight from Goa to Kathmandu. Long story short: The agents in Goa could not find the ticket and we booked a new flight to Mumbai in Economy Class. The agents in Mumbai could see the ticket but since we did not use the portion from Goa to Mumbai the ticket was now invalidâ€¦and we bought another Ticket from Mumbai to Kathmandu. (By now the ticket was refunded and we received a compensation. But that was a long way.)

"  Saskatoon to Toronto. If you are in Canada and want to fly, you lack options! Only Air Canada and WestJet. I flew to India in April and May this year. While coming back to Canada I had my parents with me and because of their old age and my father's nerve problem in his feet, I asked for a wheelchair facility for both. They failed to provide wheelchairs both in Delhi and in Toronto. I filed a complain and after that they gave me a CAD 400 discount on my next booking. So, I booked flights for three of us to go to Toronto (return ticket). Don't take me wrong. Air Canada on international routes is pretty good. The crew are helpful and food is good. Good entertainment options! Legroom is small but its economy! However, their domestic route flights are the worst I have seen. No food or drinks offered on long haul flights (Saskatoon-Toronto takes 3.5 hours). Legroom small. Sometimes no entertainment system (Saskatoon-Vancouver/Calgary routes). They need to be more friendly towards customer. Offer more options inflight.",Passive
"  Auckland to Los Angeles. Sat writing this as I wait for my next flight. Shockingly bad: this was leg 1 through to London and I used airpoints to upgrade this portion to premium economy. No welcome, no chat, fizzy wine after an age to â€˜welcome' you on board in a plastic cup! No menu. I was 2 in a row of 4: fair enough, it was a last moment thing: but when it takes nearly 10 minutes to bring a glass of water (or climb over sleeping co-passengers) that's bad. The staff were overworked and grumpy. Premium economy on Air NZ is a joke. Never again. It's not what Air NZ used to be and it's frankly not good enough for our National Airline.",Passive
Just finished a roundtrip Helsinki to Toronto via Reykjavik on Icelandair. The fare was booked in February and very competitive at 500EUR. Reykjavik airport is very convenient for transfer and for someone who does not enjoy long flights it was wonderful to only have a 5-hour transatlantic sector. Cabin crew very senior and just polite not friendly at all. The worst part is the buy-on-board menu which really should include more choice in warm meals. A tasteless vegetarian wrap just is not sufficient. Best to bring own snacks. For the fare paid Icelandair got me there safely and almost on schedule. Still wish they'd make passengers feel more welcome with a few smiles thrown in.,Passive
First time with KLM. KL to Amsterdam on B777 Amsterdam To Abu Dhabi on A330. Both flights were full. The seats were typical economy so nothing flash. The cabin crew were really friendly and proactive throughout both flights. Water and or juice was offered quite frequently a courtesy bar area was available with drinks and snacks ie help yourself not that you needed it because staff were very attentive to requests. Food was ok with staff working well as a team when some options were short on supply. All flights were right on time. I flew on with them to and out and of Norwich. Anyone travelling into England might chose this to avoid Heathrow. I was in my hire car 15 minutes after arriving in Norwich. I would fly with KLM again.,Promoter

"â Unverified | Toronto to Fort Lauderdale. Flew round trip and was impressed with the flight to Toronto from Fort Lauderdale. However, the return flight did not compare in cleanliness of the plane, nor the in flight service, nor the appearance of the Flight Attendants. I was seated in the back half of the plane, within the last 6 rows, and noticed the area and seats had not been cleaned before we boarded. The Flight attendants looked disheveled, hair messy, clothes wrinkled, tired, and did not smile. As I had an aisle seat, one of the attendants kept bumping into me, without apology, everytime she went up and down the aisles. During the flight a beverage service was offered to the passengers, but not all passengers. The passengers in the back of the plane were not offered any beverage with no explanation as to why! I was quite unhappy with this lack of customer service. It was with great reluctance that I booked my December trip with Canada rouge. I sincerely hope this was just a one time occurrence!",Passive

"  AC 1898, I was flying to Vegas from Kansai and had the ""pleasure"" of flying Air Canada Rouge in economy for the last leg between Vancouver and Vegas. I was going to the washroom and was stuck behind the cart handing out drinks, the hostess asked if I would wait 4 or 5 minutes and I said okay, however I proceeded to wait 20 while they continued to care to passengers who wanted alcohol. That being said the business class washrooms were completely empty, when 15 mins were up I asked if some of us could just use that and she responded that she was done and then went on to ask some more passengers ahead of her if they wanted drinks - she was definitely not done and made us all wait longer. There wasn't even an apology after we were all allowed to go to the washroom, other passengers who weren't waiting for the washroom thought the situation was pretty stupid too. I think that this was quite ridiculous as I am sure that serving alcohol is not the priority on a 2hrs and 45 minute flight but people who want to head to the washroom may be a tad above that need. I usually have great flights with Air Canada and its maybe because I usually try taking the upgraded seats. A frankly bewildered flyer.",Detractor

On the way there our first leg, Vancouver to Calgary, second leg, Calgary to Halifax, Air Canada Rouge. Air Canada Rouge was awful. We flew out of Calgary at 1130 at night and were met by stewardesses with top hats and fancy slack outfits. Once on the plane we were squashed in seats with no TVs and offered to rent Ipads for $10 to watch TV.

LaGuardia-Denver-Phoenix. Incoming plane to LGA was delayed for mechanical reasons. Plane to DEN therefore left the gate 2 hours late.

There was a huge queue at both London Gatwick and Geneva at bag drop and the boarding process is still a mess due to easyJet's new hand baggage guarantee making people rush to avoid having their bags placed in the hold.

I checked in online to be able to select a throne seat free of charge, and got a throne seat on the right hand Side of the plane. I arrived at the airport to be checked in very quickly by a polite trainee. I was told I could use any star alliance carrier lounge in Suvarnabhumi Airport, so I decided to use the Singapore airlines lounge. It was a newly renovated lounge with comfortable seating areas and heaps of food! One gesture I really appreciate Swiss for is the fact that they have a designated waiting area for First, Business and Gold card members at the boarding gate. Upon boarding, I'm greeted by a flight attendant who takes my coat, and champagne. I find the seat to be slightly narrow, especially at the foot portion, however I was able to sleep sideways. There is heaps of storage available everywhere. I would pay for this seat again if the price was a little less expensive (maybe $100 max). The flight attendants on this flight serving the business class section was mostly Thai crew, with the rest french-speaking Swiss crew. They were all engaging, polite and eager to help. The menu was presented with a choice of two starters and four main courses. I had a fish starter and a fish entree. The dessert tasted great, and there was a snack service during the flight, and another meal service before landing. I had a pasta with chicken and that was very good as well. The entertainment system was pretty poor, but was enough to keep me entertained. After landing in ZÃ¼rich, I went to the Swiss lounge which had snacks and soup. I discovered I didn't get my Royal Orchid Plus number quoted in my boarding pass, and the lounge attendant was able to help me put in the number for my card. Boarding the A321 to London would've been chaotic without priority boarding, and the boarding process took long. The business class on short haul is horrible the empty middle seat made me feel like I was flying economy. On this flight, there was a beef tartare served. It was very nice, and the condiments accompanying it as well. In conclusion, Swiss is a nice airline for long haul, but terrible for short haul.",Promoter

We told the assistant these hadn't worked on our long haul trips, but he insisted on trying. Sure enough, it didn't work, but the assistant would not give us our passports, insisting on trying another couple of times because staff get into trouble with the airlines if passengers do not use the self service machines. We ended up at a desk. The lady we went to looked miserable. She told us our check in had been partially completed and had been done incorrectly. When we mentioned our issues with the machines, she told us that's not her problem. She again said that the assistants at the self service check in machines are told by the airlines/airport to ensure people avoid the check in desks. The flight was generally comfortable but staff were not as attentive as some airlines. When my wife was ill on the long leg of of our journey to Shanghai, I stood outside a locked toilet for some time, holding what was clearly a full sick bag. One air hostess walked around me a couple of times and made a point of giving the bag a grim glance, but still ignored me.

I asked if there was a gluten free option and the assistant said ""No just this"". Following this we could have pretzels and biscuits with a drink. Obviously someone like me who is a coeliac cannot eat anything with wheat/gluten so I was left with a slab of cheese which should have gone with the crackers.

"I was very disappointed to find that British Airways are now a very 'middle of the road' airline compared to a decade ago. Why? Firstly, compared to my only other flight in an A380 (Qatar Airways) there are more seats crammed into the BA business. On the outbound flight, only 1 of the 2 upper deck toilets was working and on the return flight my in-flight entertainment screen was broken which meant that it was not visible and kept springing back to a near closed position. The only possible solution the steward could find (as there was a critical bolt missing) was to wedge it with a cork which sounds very 'Flintstones' for a 21st century airline and whenever we hit slight turbulence the cork kept popping out and removing the screen from view (very annoying when you are half way through a film). The flat bed and window cabin storage was good but the beef that was my chosen main course was tough, tasteless and quite inedible. I gave up after 10 minutes of trying to cut it and chew it.

Business Class (Premium Class) NYC-OSLO-NYC in July/August of 2013. Staff generally friendly and professional and planes are clean. At JFK no separate check in for Premium and I had to drag my bag over to a bag-drop area after check in. At the gate they had priority boarding for children and Premium albeit a bit disorganized. Older A340 which they have wet-leased from HiFly out of Portugal (original interior of old Emirates). There was a small first class section and a large business class section. After take off I was allowed to move up to an empty first class seat which was lay-flat but not all that comfortable. Business class seats are comfortable very padded and with a good recline and foot rest but there is no lay-flat or even close. Inflight entertainment system is disengaged so do not expect anything. The food thrown at you is deplorable. Actually worse than what you get in economy on long- haul! Return today from Oslo not so good. Of course no Premium check in and here not even priority boarding. The leg rest of my seat wasn't working and it turns out Norwegian had known about it for a long time. Food again the same. After they throw that food package in front of you and clearly states that you only get one alcoholic drink you don't see them again before a basic coffee service. I had to walk to the very back of the A340 in order to buy some snacks and drinks after â€œdinner. Don't expect Business Class on Norwegian when you buy Premium.,Passive
"  QF 604, Melbourne to Brisbane (B737-800) with Qantas Airways. This was an uneventful flight at the early hours of the morning. Boarding was earlier than schedule and FA's seemed to be very efficient with the process of ensuring smaller items being stored under the seat and larger items in the cabin storage above. This helped ensure people we not left scrambling for places to place their cabin luggage and the flight was not delayed in the process. The breakfast offering was either cereal or a warmed frittata. I went for the latter and thought it was better than average for an flight albeit I was not very hungry to start with. IFE was in the form of Q Streaming which is a wifi setup whereby you can watch and listen to a range of things from your smartphone or laptop. Overall â€“ good flight.",Passive

" I was flying from Boston to Cleveland, and my flight was delayed three hours, so I had tried to book my ticket for an earlier flight the next day. These two ladies behind the desk could not have cared less about helping me, or seeing what they could do to help my situation. One of them even laughed at me when I had asked if I could change it to an earlier flight. I don't normally leave reviews, but this was not the first unfortunate situation I have been in with Spirit. They were sarcastic and rude. I am never flying with this airline again.",Detractor
Flew with Aeroflot CPH-SVO-NRT. Excellent service. I am a tall guy and Economy Class is usually a nightmare especially on long-haul flights. On my trip to Tokyo the flight attendants noticed that I was struggling to get room for my knees and offered me one of their personal seats which had more legroom and since these seats did not have any entertainment system the crew made sure I was comfortable for giving me extra drinks. (I got a full bottle of wine for free!!) Aeroflot has become an excellent airline and I will be happy to travel with them again.,Promoter
" I took my flight from New York to Bombay via Beijing. First the flight got delayed for 1.5 hour at JFK airport then it got delayed at Beijing airport for another 4 hours, when plane was on runway at Beijing airport the it stopped there and took a halt for 2 hours and they stated the reason that there is no fuel in the plane. This is very negligent on a part of international airline that they didn't check for fuel when waited for 2-3 hours, its like keeping the life of customer at risk. When I reached Mumbai Airport, I didn't got my baggage there and airline employee informed me that my baggage is at Beijing airport, they forgot to transfer my bag to the connecting flight. I got my bags after 4 days at my home with items missing from my bag. Air China's customer service is very bad and they take no responsibility for their customer's safety and product security. I have contacted them several time but got no proper response, it is very irresponsible behavior. Air China is taking no responsibility to help me find my items or compensate me for the loss. Even during flight when I asked for water, they told me they are out of disposal glass which is very bad on part of service the airline is providing. Worst service for safety and security.",Detractor
"The short flight from Manchester was very good, staff very nice, friendly and very helpful. Frankfurt to Johannesburg I was seated in Economy as usual, but just before take-off it was announced that seats were available in Premier Economy at the extra cost of 300 Euros. I asked a flight attendantif I could look at the seats before I committed to paying the extra money and she kindly took me through - I was delighted to see seats in this class were far superior to Economy. I agreed to pay the extra, was moved to my new seat and from then on my flying experience turned out to be one of the best I had ever had, it was brilliant, I felt that I was treated like a VIP. The flight attendant couldn't have been more helpful and kinder. I would defintely recommend Premium Economy to anyone. Thank you Lufthansa and your staff.",Promoter
"I flew Norwegian from New York to Bangkok, with a stopover in Oslo. I was very surprised when I boarded the plane - it was the cleanest, most modern plane I'd even flown on. The seats were also roomier than any other long haul airline I have flown (Aer Lingus, British Airways, Delta, KLM, and United). Although the entertainment did not have as many options as other airlines, the value is excellent overall. At a fraction of the price, I would happily fly Norwegian again. My only recommendation is to make sure your ticket includes an inflight meal. Some tickets don't include meals, which was a surprise some passengers. If your ticket doesn't include a meal, I suggest grabbing some snacks at the airport.",Promoter
"I was visiting Miami for an academic conference. My colleagues arrived to MIA a bit late due to traffic issues/flooding. We arrived to the airport around 55 min before our departure on AA1265 to PHL. With no bags to check, we proceeded to security where I noticed that my boarding pass would not load on either the mobile app nor via the browser. I told my colleagues to go through security without me, and went to a nearby American Airlines kiosk to print my ticket. It did not work. I tried another kiosk which printed an error ticket, directing me to the counter. I did check-in from home earlier that day and had a reserved seat on this flight. Aware of the lack of time, I informed the check-in line rep of the situation, who referred me to the supervisor. She understood my situation but insisted I wait in the bag check line to print my ticket, despite 0 bags to check. When I said the delay would cause me to miss my flight she unsympathetically told me that I should have arrived 2 hrs early and walked away dismissively. At the counter, the agent printed my ticket easily with no explanation as to why it didn't work on my phone or from the kiosk. I went through security and sprinted to my gate, only to miss it by a few moments (walkway still attached), both of my colleagues aboard. Rebooking was apathetic and booked me standby for 7am.

Will never fly with Vueling, or at least pay extra for anything. Complete robbery. I paid for a service that did not apply to my trip, and all I get is a shrug shoulder.",Detractor

"Got to the gate 2 hours early, while changing my seat number with the Delta rep she frivolously pointed out that the plane wasn't there yet and she had no idea why. Long story short our plane was scheduled for a routine engine change on account of reaching so many miles. No one in the tower or the boarding team was aware of this. No matter who's fault it was the point is they obviously can't communicate and manage the airline effectively. Pathetic customer is service - it consisted of blaming the tower and pushing back the departure time every 15 minutes with full confidence that it would leave then. Well, it didn't. Eventually they got a a new plane and it left 2.5 hours late. I had a connection flight that I missed as a result.",Detractor

"Boise to Northwest Arkansas via Dallas Ft Worth. Round trip flight with four legs, first was late, second was canceled twice on two different days, third on time, fourth was late. The canceled flights was the worst. We started late, sat on the tarmac for one hour and returned to the gate. This was weather related and I am ok with that. As soon as we got inside the terminal they announced that the flight was canceled. They also would not give us our luggage, including gate checked luggage, which for us was a wheelchair. Fortunately one of the gate crew retrieved the wheelchair for us. Otherwise it would have been an even greater disaster. When we asked for our luggage they told us it would be at XNA when we got there. When we asked about lodging and meals we were informed that they have no obligation to provide that for weather related issues. When asked about future flights we were told the first available seats were for 8:00 PM the next day. In about an hour the plane left with our luggage for another itinerary. So much for weather related cancellation. They canceled us so they could use that plane for a more profitable flight. That to me that quit being a weather related issue and became a business issue. They did book us on a flight for the next morning. (so much for no seats until 8 PM) When we arrived at the airport that flight had been canceled also. I didn't hear the reason as we were scrambling to get a car to drive up. When we got there our luggage was waiting for us as evidenced by the computer showing it there and the agent being able to deliver it to us and confirm delivery on her computer. Unknown to us, they canceled our return flights the next day. Probably because we never made the second leg of our itinerary. They obviously knew we made it there because we picked up our luggage. I suppose their computers aren't capable of talking to each other. I didn't find out our reservations had been canceled until a week later when I tried to check in and they couldn't find us. I called their help desk and was told the flight from DFW to BOI was fully booked, then after further research they restored all our reservation except for our seats. When I logged in to chose our seats I found quite a few available on both flights, the only downside was that I had to pay an extra $170 because these were considered premium seats, even though two were center seats. Bottom line, avoid American Airlines if at all possible. They have the worst customer service and their integrity is lacking when they cancel you for weather issues and fly about an hour later with other passengers.",Detractor
"We have flown on United almost exclusively for the past few years, a half dozen times per year. This last trip was the last straw. On the way there, at DCA, there were two agents for about 150 people waiting to go on various flights. It took us a good 45 minutes to get through ticketing and baggage. We missed a connection because the crew was still in transit to the airport and we took off hours late. Of course our luggage did not make it. It arrived at our hotel 3 days later. Our flight home was cancelled a few weeks before, so we were forced to take one at 8am, which meant waking at 4.30 am. We arrived at the airport, boarded, and were taken off the plane as it did not pass inspection. The flight was then cancelled and the next one was at 8pm, arriving home at midnight. We went to the customer service desk with all 300 other passengers but decided to go to another customer service desk. The agent was nasty and sarcastic to those in front of us, and to us. We had to fly to a city 2 hours from home - giving up our first class seats- and rent a car to get home, uncompensated. But we are experienced, since the same thing happened a few months ago with United.",Detractor
We flew Economy from AMS to BKK. The air-conditioning blew very cold air on both flights we had with EVA. We fly very often and know how the temperature should feel like. Although we asked the flight attendants to change the temperature and made them aware of all the other passengers that needed jackets and shawls they didn't really care about our problem. I also think like many others here that EVA tries to lower the costs by putting on a cold airco. So take a hat a winter jacket and thick socks with you if you decide with EVA Air. Another problem is that under many seats there a steal boxes (I think they are the entertainment boxes for the screens) so that you don't have enough space for your seats. Very uncomfortable. We could further not check in online and when we arrives esrly at the check in we were both times told that we couldn't sit together although we had booked months in advance. Very bad service! The crew looks like the Chinese Army with their dark green uniform and their hair cuts and they lack a kind of warmth and interest in their guests. I hope that these problems will also be read by EVA Air so that these things will change. The food was okay but the drinks were served in half full plastic glasses.,Passive
Stockholm ARN to New York JFK. The dreamliner had been replaced by A340. Seats OK but inflight video system out of order. Meal service was a joke. After almost 3 hours we were served a light meal and one glass of wine. No possibility to buy anything else until meal trays had been cleared and bar trolleys where rolled out. By then we were 2 hours from landing in New York! If I have to fly with this airline again I will stock up with own water and food.,Detractor
" Unless you're very careful in how you book the flights and check your documents, you will have a nasty surprise at check in as we did - we apparently hadn't pre booked our meal or our hold bags (both of which had been included in our outward bound flight so we assumed the return flight would be the same). We paid $60 each to check in our hold bags and had no meals during the flight. The snack bar ran out less than an hour into a ten hour flight - not even tea available. No water offered to us at any point. Only the kindness of one of the stewards after he found a spare meal, stopped me fainting from hunger. Seats - awful, short, narrow and hard. A small selection of films available, no music channels. Staff, overworked, mostly brusque from coping with many complaining passengers. Unless you're desperate choose another airline.",Detractor
" Finnair is nothing better than a no-frill or low-cost Carrier. But the positive point first: Finnair is still a safe airline when it comes to the technical reliability. And the planes are clean.

I told her I'm logged-in but cannot find a button like ""change flight"" or something similar. No answer.

Flying CA regularly. Mostly FRA-PEK-CGQ. One of the worst Star-Alliance airlines. Especially frustrating is the absolutely abominable call center and ground staff - they do not only convey a lack of interest into their customers they are simply incompetent when it comes to handling delayed passengers or flight rebooking. The airline's website is a joke (booking flights there often doesn't work at all or is as complicated as applying for a tax refund). Flight experience itself - there have been improvements over the years but only gradually. The food for example is still one of the worst you can get. All in all - only fly Air China as long as you can get hold of a very cheap ticket and you're very patient when it comes to finding staff willing to help you when you're delayed or want to change something regarding your booking.,Detractor
" Islip to Orlando. Not even for free will I fly this airline again. The ground crew were very accommodating but the flight was horrendous. After I made my reservations I wound up in a walking boot due to a foot injury. No issues at all, provided wheel chairs and moved my seats to front of the plane upon request. I knew not to expect internet, food, etc. as it was a no frills airline. So no issues there. Flight to Islip went without a hitch, seats not as comfortable as other airlines but also paid half price of other options. Flight back to Florida, now that is where the issues began.

While there I went to Frontier counter to speak to rep to see if anything had changed and what were the chances the flight would be canceled. Of course no answers.

In the meantime, left in the dark. Well the flight that was now scheduled for 9:07 finally departed at 10pm and arrived in Orlando at 1am.

" Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they don't respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements. Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods. Emirates responded to me in 7 days as - â€œit is the airline industry policy and agreement between airlines.

"  Outbound my wife an I flew from Seattle to Denver on Delta. Nice seats, complimentary snacks and free carry-on bags. When we flew back to Seattle from Denver we flew Frontier as both flights came as a package deal using Travelocity. I wasn't aware that Frontier had a carry-on fee of $30. When we got to the gate a Frontier representative announced that if you have carry-on bags you should have a ticket with that annotated it on it. We did not have that annotation. We were forced to pay $60 per bag to take our carry-ons home. Then, while on the plane, I witnessed passenger 18C ask the attendant if he had to pay for his bag in the overhead stowage. To my disbelief she put his bag in the stowage and said don't worry about it. Lesson learned: act dumb and they'll not worry about the fee. To add insult to injury, the last 20 minutes of the flight we were bombarded with the flight attendant advertising their credit card and it's benefits. They went so far as to pass out applications and have passengers fill them out before they got off the plane. Besides that, the seats were uncomfortable on the A319 without the ability to retract and little to no leg room.

" Honolulu to Los Angeles. I attempted to check in online 18 hours prior to my flight. For whatever reason, the system processed mine but not my wife's. Since in the inbound flight we weren't seated together, I wanted to rectify this. I called AA and the first agent who answered immediately suggested it was my fault because I ""didn't check a box or something"". I suggested he first listen to me and run my record locator. All I wanted to do was ensure me. And my wife sat together this time. When he did, he said this is an issue with British Airways since they issued the ticket. I said that's impossible, because BA doesn't handle check in for flights on AA. I asked to speak to a supervisor, and was told to call BA or they could put me in touch with their website tech support (why?). Both the initial agent as well as the supervisor were incredibly rude and appeared to be doing whatever possible to get me off the line. I called BA. The agent, Dev, went above and beyond what could possibly be expected, and stayed with me for an hour to help. I explained what happened and he told me they're ""giving you the run around"" because, of course, BA doesn't handle check in for domestic AA flights. He offered to call AA for me and we were on a conference call. The supervisor he spoke to informed him that there was an issue with the passport info. He asked them to change the info and complete checkin and was told that was impossible. He said he knows for a fact it isn't, and it happens all the time. Since checkin wasn't my issue, but seating, he suggested my wife simply be given a seat next to me and she would complete checkin at the airport. The AA supervisor said that, too, was impossible. Until she's checked in, they can't assign a seat. Once again, the BA agent explained that this is impossible and he has lists of policies and regulations, not to mention previous experience. The AA supervisor hung up on him mid sentence. He apologized profusely and said he never experienced anything like this. We called again, and the agent we got this time was just as unhelpful and refused to do anything, but was at least pleasant. She suggested I pay to select my wife's seat, because next to me there is an empty one. The BA agent again asked why they can't assign it to her, it's within 24 hours of the flight. No. They won't assign it, they won't fix her checkin, but they're happy to SELL the seat. At this point in my frustration I said fine, I'll buy it. $50 additional fee if the agent takes my payment. Both me and the BA agent were at a loss for words. I ended up going online to buy the seat next to me for my wife, with Dev and the AA supervisor on hand to confirm it went through. AA succeeded in ruining my last day in Honolulu and wasting 2 hours of my time in order to squeeze even more money out of me. I would have thought that would be it, but upon arrival at Heathrow, I learned my bags didn't make the flight (2hr layover at LAX). This airline is an absolute joke, with complete disregard for passengers. Even the discount carriers treat you better. BA offered a black and white comparison between how an airline should behave and how it shouldn't. Dev was apologizing for things that weren't his fault, stayed with me until the end, whereas AA staff were aggressive and condescending, and even hung up on their British colleague. Absolutely shameful. The plane was also terrible, but west coast/Hawaii flights typically are. Shameful behavior.",Detractor

"My recent experience in first class on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to Salt Lake City (round trip) was anything but first class. The seats in the first class cabin are spaced so close that the tray tables cannot be put in place if the passenger in front of you has reclined his/her seat. This was true of any first class passenger faced with the situation. The flight attendant offered lamely that she wondered why this was a problem saying: ""That's strange."" Well, it's not strange, Delta has crowded more seats into first class than the seats are designed to permit. It was VERY difficult to get seated in so little foot room as there was.

When the first flight was canceled on my outgoing flight the next option would have been to either fly two days later from the same airport or 1 day later from another airport (which cost me $100 to get to). On my return journey, the first flight was cancelled again. They tried to book me onto a Delta flight but didn't manager to transfer my passenger information, so I missed the flight.

"  Flew American Airline's seasonal route between Los Angeles and Anchorage. Ground crew during check-in at LAX lacked sense of urgency to quickly process heavy-volume of passengers on a busy Friday evening. Customer service skills were below average. American Airlines' ground crew at LAX didn't even say elementary things like, ""Hi, How are you?"" or ""Have a nice flight."" On-board the A319, the leather seats in economy class were nice. There is no seat-back TV for a long 5 hour flight. The on-board wi-fi worked well. During return flight, the cabin was very uncomfortably warm and that made it harder to sleep. No pillows are provided during overnight flight between Anchorage and Los Angeles.",Detractor
"  San Francisco to Frankfurt in First Class. Lufthansa uses the United Global First Lounge at SFO, a pleasant, but unremarkable, space. Lufthansa's A380 First Class cabin has an 8-seat arrangement. I was in 1A, right in the front and on the second deck of the aircraft. Upon entry into the cabin each First Class passenger is given a personal locker to store carry-on luggage. The seat was extremely comfortable, with a modicum of privacy provided by an adjustable screen separator. Two spacious washrooms serviced the First Class cabin. Where Lufthansa's First Class product excelled was in its exceptional onboard service. The lady flight attendant assigned to me was highly professional and personable, anticipating my needs as the flight progressed. Turndown service with mattress and blanket was provided when I wanted to sleep. Since I don't drink alcoholic beverages there's nothing to add to on that front. As for the food, this is as good as it gets on a flight, but I like to eat light. After landing, I went to the excellent Lufthansa First Class Lounge at FRA, an oasis of calm, and after a relaxing couple of hours was driven in a limousine via the tarmac directly to my outbound aircraft.",Promoter
I started flying Delta about a year ago and surprisingly there wasn't much to complain about. After reading a few reviews I was a bit sceptical but I flew them from SIN-NRT-JFK and I enjoyed the flight more than SQ. The flight attendants were warmer and friendly while we departed on time and on schedule without delays. The legroom was better than SQ and was worth the extra cost. The food although small in portions was not as bad as I expected. Overall I would recommend flying Delta.,Promoter
" They don't really care about customer relations. I have seen several times that they overbook the flights when seriously, with advent of technology, it can clearly be avoided. They don't even have enough staff at airports to run things smoothly. Let me tell you what I went through: 1) First my flight from Cedar Rapids to Chicago was delayed by 3 hours. You know how far Chicago is from Cedar Rapids? Just 30 minutes if we go by air. This has happened to me twice. You know airlines from other countries are carrying passengers on their transatlantic flights without delays, cancellations and excellent customer service. Its about time they visit those countries and take a lesson on how to provide a valuable customer service. 2) Then, they let everyone board the plane but somehow manage to find an excuse to not take off. We had to wait for take-off on tarmac for 2 hours and on top of that, the pilot doesn't even announce periodically what is going on. This was agonizing for so many passengers. I purposely selected this flight because I had a 3 hour layover in Chicago and I was going to meet my friend, but because of delays caused by American Airlines, I will have to wait for another couple of months. Don't even tell me it was a weather related delay as it was sunny! They clearly either didn't have pilots or planes to provide the service and yet, booked us knowing very well that their services were not adequate in any way. I reached Chicago Airport at 5.30 pm when I was supposed to arrive there around 2.30 pm. But this was just the beginning. 3) Then while waiting for my next plane out of Chicago to Newark, they very cleverly increased the delay by 15-20 minutes at one time so that customers don't cancel with them and fly with any other airlines because when you incrementally delay flights by 15 minutes, customers are more likely to stay with that particular airline in order to reach their destination. Whereas, if you had displayed from the beginning that it was 2-3 hours delay, customers were more likely to look for other options to reach their destination. 4) Then we boarded the plane at 8.30 pm, 2.5 hours after scheduled time and the same thing happened. We were on the runway for the next 2.5 hours. 2.5 hours! For what? No one knows. Crew failed to provide any update. There was no weather delays again. After 2.5 hours, the pilot turned the plane back to gate telling that he has completed his hours and couldn't fly. Tell me about commitment levels displayed by American Airlines. Clearly, there is nothing American about your airlines anymore. 5) Then, I was told bags will arrive at carousel 6 and they arrived at carousel 7 instead. Ground staff in baggage claim area didn't even have a clue that my flight was cancelled. When I asked about where was my bag, I gave him my bag ticket and he was said â€œwhat was texture of your bag, what color was your bagâ€? What sort of ridiculous questions were they? 7) Now, I had to skip my whole day at work. Horrible!",Detractor
DL 1134 PBI-ATL. Great ground experience. Inbound flight late prior to equipment arrival gate agents asked for volunteers to check baggage at no charge to destination to speed up boarding and ease overheads. Turn around was 25 minutes gate arrival-departure. Plane was clean crew greeted boarding passengers with genuine smiles. They assisted loading overheads with no attitude. In flight they chatted with passengers. Crew even made the cart in aisle/trip to lav a pleasant game of I move/you move. I was in a time warp. Flying was fun.

"  This is a review of the airline, not the flight, as I was not allowed to fly. I had an 8am flight from Boston to San Francisco in their version of Business Class, Mint. When I tried to checking online it would not allow me, so I went to the airport and at the kiosk I was also told to see someone. I stood in line for 30 minutes and was refused a ticket despite having paid for the ticket in advanced on my frequent flyer account on JetBlue site. I had a charge from JetBlue on a previous family trip that I was disputing with my credit card company as fraudulent. Although I had not received notice it appears the credit card company agreed the charges were fraudulent and reversed the charges. Despite selling me a ticket they would not let me get a boarding ticket without paying the fraudulent charges that were in dispute. The shift supervisor said that I could not do anything but pay and that there was no one else to talk to about it. In short I missed my flight and had to rebook on a real carrier later and missed important meeting.

" Chicago to Belgrade via Frankfurt. Flights were fine but customer service was seriously lacking. We were initially delayed in Chicago for a day due to weather conditions. We confirmed with (and were assured by) Lufthansa staff that our baggage would arrive with us in Belgrade before we left on our Chicago flight. After a layover in Frankfurt we finally arrived in Belgrade. Of course, our luggage did not arrive as initially confirmed. We talked to airport staff and expressed our concern as our wedding attire was in the luggage and we were having our ceremony the following weekend. After dealing with airport staff we were sent home and told we would be contacted when our luggage arrived. Three days later we were told our bags had showed up but due to customs we would have to drive the 3 hours back to Belgrade to retrieve them. After another day of our trip lost and a few hundred dollars in gas, tolls, and customs fees, we finally had our clothes. When we returned to the US we filed a claim for the hardship and money lost due to their delays. We have been going back and forth for a couple months now with an endless string of emails requesting that we submit more and more documents and receipts and whatnot. What a nightmare this has been dealing with their customer service team. This should be a simple case with some financial consideration for losing our luggage for 3 days. Very disappointed and hesitant to fly with them again.",Detractor
" Boston to Phoenix. Let me start by saying we travel a lot. We have never dealt with such rude and incompetent customer service in our lives. Over the course of two flights (roundtrip) we contacted American Airlines customer service about 7-8 times both over the phone and in person at the airport (customer service desk, gate agent) all regarding the same issue. They all gave us different answers and in some cases flat out incorrect information. We had issues with seats, with bags, but most importantly - when people are paying - any amount of money for that matter - you address their concerns in some way. After this awful travel experience we contacted their corporate customer service and got basically - sorry - can't help, fly with us again please. Even worse they clearly didn't even read the complaint. In the response they addressed the wrong issue and claimed I was travelling with my wife (I was travelling with my husband). Their lack of concern for customers is evident in the fact that they can't even read their emails fully. The whole process has just been incredibly frustrating - this business should be ashamed of themselves.",Detractor
  Flew from Dublin to London in late May. The plane was delayed for 45 minutes but caught up 30 minutes and arrived in London 15 minutes late. However we were boarded on time even though they knew that they had no landing slot in London. Very uncomfortable on a hot morning but crew excellent and information updates regular and informing. Flight ok. THe return trip was a disaster. Arrived early to Heathrow and placed on an earlier flight which was constantly being put back and eventually took off 20 minutes after the departure time for our original flight. We had been checked in but couldn't board the plane because the crew had not arrived. Passengers were held standing for about 30 minutes in a very small area. The crew were fussy and over officious and spent alot of their time correcting individual passengers. The intercom communications from flight staff were incomplete as they managed every time to cut themselves off and were totally indistinct. Overall an unexpected horrendous experience as previous flights with Aer Lingus had been consistently good. Probably will be slow to fly with them again due to consistent lateness of flights and staff issues.,Detractor
CDG-SGN. This flight was a codeshare booked through Vietnam airlines for a very good price. We were able to select seats by checking in on the Air France website which was easy to use. Check in at CDG was a nightmare - I don't think I've waited this long for economy check-in - the fact that this was business class (in the sky priority area) made it really bad. There seemed to be about 6 counters open for all of Air France business class at CDG (hundreds of people - huge line snaking on for ever). No priority pass for customs/security. Lounge was good (see separate review). 777-200ER plane full in business. Service was excellent - excellent staff polite and efficient. I quite like the seat - although its not horizontal quite comfy for lounging some minor acrobatics had to be performed if you are not on the aisle and need to get over someone who is fully stretched out. Food was acceptable for plane food although they did run out of my choice (sitting in 4K). Champagne was delicious (Ayala) and they set up a self service bar in the galley - very much preferred to constantly pressing the call button. No priority pass given for customs at SGN. Although this flight was not perfect the 11 hours went by in a flash and I had a great time and would not hesitate to recommend Air France.,Promoter

This is my first time on Ethiopian airlines and was impressed. The Route from LAX to Dublin is new and just started in June 2015. I was hesitant when booking but the fares were extremely good. The flight attendants were wonderful and I was impressed by their professionalism and concern for the passengers needs and comfort. The food and drink was very good. The plane being a new 787 Dreamliner was immaculate and this is the fastest flight I have had to Dublin. The direct route from LAX to DUB definitely filled a void since Aer Lingus pulled out several years ago. I would recommend this airline. The prices are reasonable and the service is fantastic. The hours of this flight are a little odd leaving LAX around midnight. The Dublin flight leaves for LAX at 6.15 am. If you can deal with those hours then this airline is the way to travel. No more flying 5 plus hours to the east coast laying over for hours and then having another 7 hour journey ahead. Our flight time was a little over 9 hours to Ireland.,Promoter

"Four segments on Delta, one on KLM and one on Air France on a return trip from Ford Airport to Delhi. The Delta experience was really solid, from the friendliness of ground and onboard staff to cleanliness of planes. I am partial to the A330 because the 2-4-2 seating feels less cramped than the 9 or 10 across seating in newer widebody aircraft. Seats reasonable for economy, AVOD had nice foreign film choices and everything worked. Food was OK at best, probably the weakest part of the experience but not bad. Checking into a Delta flight at CDG was a little puzzling due to using Air France desks. SkyTeam does a great job overall, though, getting Delta passengers beyond Europe.",Promoter

They charge you for everything, they'd probably charge you to go to the toilet. Their fees are extortionate and exagerated. Entertainment on the plane? Forget about it. Not even a monitor in the middle of aisle to view the GPS. Be careful on their website, before you actually pay for your ticket, they try to sell you extra things, make sure you select â€œno thanksâ€ if they are not for you. If you buy 2 tickets at the same time, you dont get seats together, you have to pay extra for that.

DXB-BAH-BKK in Falcon Gold on an A340 and an A330. Inconsistency is the name of the game with Gulf Air. From a premium cabin point of view Gulf Air has three main problems - its aircraft crew and its catering all range from top notch to very poor. DXB-BAH an old looking A340 featuring an equally old and completely outdated interior - legroom in the former First Class seats in row 1/ 2 seemed quite spacious legroom in the four rows that used to be Business Class is very poor. This is Business Class the way it used to be 15 or 20 years ago. On the 55 min flight to Bahrain a small warm meal was served with beverages. The crew was professional and friendly service. In Bahrain I spent some time enjoying the Business class lounge where plenty of food and Champagne was available. BAH-BKK to Bangkok I had seat 1F in a seat I knew from when it used to be First Class. A330s of Gulf Air feature excellent premium cabins although there are always technical problems with the seats. Seats in row 1 and 2 with plenty of space and privacy. Friendly and professional service was provided by flight attendants. A full dinner service provided with continental breakfast before landing. Meal is nicely set up with no use of trays but food presentation and taste could be improved. While plenty of drinks are provided it would be nice if wine was poured from the bottle in the cabin rather than in the galley. Gulf Air claims that sleeper suits are provided but none appeared on this flight.

"  Cairns to Auckland. The flight itself on Air New Zealand was fine with a friendly cabin crew, but the problems we had with the airline was getting the flight to operate. Our flight was continuously delayed at CNS until they finally decided to cancel our flight to AKL due to crew rest hours. The cancellation announcement came 2.5 hours after we were supposed to originally take off. The passengers were told to meet at a gate and it was a 15 minute wait to have an employee direct everyone to baggage claim to reclaim their bags and find a service desk to help all the stranded passengers. When the service desk opened another 20 minutes later there was only one employee figuring out arrangements and accommodations for a full flight. We waited in the middle of the line and after another 2.5 hours of waiting in the service line the employee told the passengers still waiting to be helped that they could find their own accommodations and transportation and be reimbursed, or they could go home and meet at the airport at 5 am for the rescheduled flight at 8 am the next morning. The airline was having trouble finding hotels for all the passengers and wasted everyone's time by not telling everyone that they could find their own accommodations and be reimbursed hours earlier. We have a future flight with Air New Zealand from AKL to SFO and we asked if we could be upgraded on that 14 hour flight to better seats instead of the airline finding us a hotel or reimbursing us, and we were rudely told that the airline doesn't do upgrades. The next morning we got to the airport as soon as the check in line opened and only one person was checking people in and helping people with their hotel reimbursements. We were also asked if we wanted a voucher for a complimentary breakfast instead of automatically being given the voucher.

It might be best for the longer flights to bring extra movies for children as there wasn't too much for them besides two movies and a bunch of episodes of Lazytown. Seating was a bit crammed but get what you pay for. The nicest part was the effort on the part of the airline to keep us all seated together without trying to gouge us or blow us off like other airlines. Customer service appears to still have a pulse with Icelandair. There was only a slight delay with one of the four flights but we still managed to leave on time.

May 31st 2014 from Denver to Orlando flight 678 return June 6 2014 flight 677. We booked our trip through our travel agent months before these new carry on charges went into effect. We were told we would not have to pay the extra fees. As we arrived at Denver airport and proceeded to the Frontier check in counter we were told we had to pay for our carry ons all of which could fit under the seats we explained what we were told and the check-in guy looked up our booking date and all was fine not the case at the Orlando airport on the way home. We asked for our check in bag back and since we still had 7 lbs allowed in that bag before they added another $75 we started to unpack bags and re-pack so as not to give them one dime more. Needless to say after all the rearranging which was totally unnecessary we were allowed to take our carry on bags as personal items. As I said before we did not have to use the carry on overhead compartments all the bags were so small they fit under the seats with no problem at all. After arriving at the gate we heard several stories like ours. There were so many upset people saying they will never fly Frontier again.

"  London Heathrow to Seoul Incheon. I was flying my return leg back to Korea after a Christmas vacation. I had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return. To start with, i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault. Having not had my selection available on the outbound leg (in business class!) i wanted to ensure i had something for my return. I couldn't pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had AGAIN run out of 50% of the available selections. Quite disgraceful. I was also unable to check in on line, so i was ""directed"" by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work. Eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in. The rest of the airport process after that was smooth. This time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat. This meant that I did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if I wanted to get out of my chair in flight. Of course I had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class - a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin. The flight was uneventful. On this occasion I had a very warm crew for which I appreciated. Overall I still feel that BA is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class. Frankly, even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time I had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i would have been better off flying another carrier.",Passive
"We were =supposed to travel from Dublin to Toronto then Toronto to Denver, but it didn't end up happening that way. It took us nearly 2 hours just to board our plane in Dublin. Then, once we were finally on, it took another 20 minutes for them to even turn the plane on. They wouldn't even turn air on for us so it was somewhere around 85 degrees Fahrenheit in the cabin. Then, after the delay, I soon discovered that Air Canada has faux wifi, as in your device will say you're connected to wifi, but in reality, you can only go to Air Canada's ""entertainment"" site. Not a good airline if you want to arrive on time to your destination. Once we landed in Toronto, we sat at the gate for over half an hour because of an accounting error that didn't even happen on the plane. They couldn't open the door, because of a mistake that didn't even directly affect us. I would like to add that there was no air again so it was even hotter than when we were boarding. We ended up getting so delayed that we missed our connecting flight in Toronto by over an hour and so did a good portion of the other passengers on the plane. They re-routed us to Chicago, then to Denver. In that time, we never saw our bags once, and both flights were delayed. Again. When we arrived in Denver this evening, we learned that none of the four suitcases in our party were on the plane that we flew in on.

"I flew Air India while returning from Chicago, a direct connection from Chicago O'Hare Intl. Airport to Delhi Indira Gandhi International. Check-in wasn't very smooth, my carry-on was a couple of kilos over 7, and I was asked to transfer some of my stuff to my check-in, and I obliged. For several years I have travelled Air India, this was the first time my carry-on was checked for weight, but this is a welcome change that ultimately makes it so much more convenient for all the passengers. After boarding, we were kept waiting for the flight to take off, and were later informed that due to a technical snag, there would be a delay. Finally, after a delay of almost two hours, we took off for our destination. Air India have deteriorated in terms of food quality in the past couple of years, and I had little expectations from the in-flight meal. The food was bland, a spinach-based curry which tasted awful, and their signature bad bread. The IFE didn't have a lot of options, but the interface itself was okay. The headphones were sub-standard and not up to the mark. This was a big disappointment, considering that it's a long-haul flight lasting just a little under 15 hours. Service was okay-ish, the stewardesses just seemed to be doing their jobs. I felt there was a need for them to brush up their spoken-English, announcements were being made in poor English. Minor problem, but something that can be worked on. The cabin itself was good, the lavatories were surprisingly clean, and the seats were quite comfortable. Apart from the food and IFE, the journey itself was quite pleasing and 15 hours passed quickly. Although Air India is not right up there with the likes of Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines, it is a pretty decent option on the ORD-DEL route.",Passive

" New Orleans to New York. Several years back I used this airline and it was horrible. Silly me trying to give them the benefit of the doubt thought they deserved a second chance. Not only is the customer service horrible but the baggage policy listed on the website does not match the information given at the door. My carry on measured 17â€, according to the website it must be below 22â€ for no charge. As I boarded a rude representative said that I would have to pay a $65 fee. I explained that my bag fit the description as advertised on the website. I even went ahead and placed my bag in the carry on box to show her. Her precise words were â€œyour bag fits the box therefore you'll have to pay the feeâ€ to sum up her reasoning if your bag is under the the size limit you'll have to pay, if it is over the size limit you'll have to pay. There is no such thing as a free carryon item with Spirit. Either way you'll have to pay. Whatever just add on an extra $130 on top of your ticket price. If I can give this review no stars I would.",Detractor
SYD-DPS GA715. DPS-SYD GA714 in Economy Class. Check in at Sydney Airport was a breeze. Didn't weigh our carry on. When we boarded flight attendants were very welcoming. Indonesian music was playing before we boarded and before we landed in DPS. Seats were comfortable. Meal service was excellent with hot meals. Several snacks and drinks served throughout the flight. Flight attendants were eager to help. Good range of movies and music in the backseat entertainment including flight map. Immigration on-board was a huge bonus and saved us plenty of time. Receiving our bags at Denpasar Airport was fairly quick. Return flight DPS-CGK (Jakarta) - SYD. We told check-in staff at the Domestic Airport in DPS that we wanted to collect our bags only at SYD and he said he could put us on a direct flight. Walked to International Airport which is next door and waited. Our flight was delayed due to a late arrival. Given a muffin and juice on board before lights were turned down. Hot breakfast was nice. Sydney Airport baggage collection was easy. I would highly recommend Garuda Indonesia.,Promoter
CDG-JED-TUU. After a good trip from RUH-LHR we then caught Eurostar to Paris. Upon checking in at CDG were told that the seats we had booked for travel between JED and TUU had been cancelled without reason. Staff at CDG were then able to re-book 3 seats for my wife and children but on arrival at JED it turned out they had been cancelled as well once again with no apparent reason. After 3 fruitless hours of to-ing and fro- ing between every desk possible with no-one was able to tell us why seats had been cancelled. We had to come back at 04.00 to see if we could get standby seats meaning we had to stay at a hotel. Thankfully we got seats for the early morning flight. Not a very good experience. I must say there was some helpful staff but mostly not much seemed to get done.,Detractor
"  Frankfurt to Miami. I checked in at the Nice, France airport with Lufthansa and received my three boarding passes. I didn't have to go through security at Frankfurt and after visiting the Lufthansa Star Alliance Lounge I walked to the boarding area. When I showed my boarding pass I was told that I needed to go to Document Check. I then got back in line and there was another problem so I went to the counter. I was told to go back to the end of the line and try again. I'm Group 1 so I wasn't happy about that. The third try I still could not get in through the gate. I was told that because I had an exit row seat I had to go through a different entrance. Good Grief. United is the only airline that I know of that seats 10 across in Premium Economy on a 777-300. The seats are tight with a 17 inch width. About 35 minutes after take-off, they turned the fasten seatbelt sign off. First came a bag of bread sticks, then came a small bottle of water, then came my food with plastic tableware and then the beverage cart with a complementary glass of wine or a beer. There was no hot or moist towel. After all food items were picked up, they came by with another glass of wine or beverage. The fasten seatbelt sign came on several times during the flight because of a very light chop. United has changed the recorded announcement to ""Please fasten your seatbelt."" The German speaking flight attendant had a very loud voice which would have made sleeping difficult, but in the economy cabin, they never turned off the lights or asked people to close their window shades so it was impossible for me to sleep. Prepare for landing, which means the fasten seatbelt sign is on and seats need to be upright was 50 minutes before landing, which makes for a long 50 minutes. When flying to Europe, I would recommend Lufthansa. On my flight a month earlier to Europe, Lufthansa turned off the fasten seatbelt sign seven minutes after take-off and it wasn't turned back on until 25 minutes to landing, a very quiet flight.",Passive
Flight SIN-ZRH followed by ZRH-AMS. If you are used to be pampered by Asian (full-frill not budget airlines) and Middle Eastern airlines you will feel the difference immediately. Cabin staff were efficient but they lack warmth when serving or dealing with passengers. Planes were not exactly new a bit worn out. Inflight entertainment seemed like those in the early-2000.

"  Extremely rude and unprofessional customer service at boarding desk. My wife, 13 year old daughter, 10 year old son and I were traveling from Barcelona to Philadelphia then from there to Los Angeles. In Barcelona we had a delay for 2 hours (sat in the airplane after boarding for 2 hours) therefore we missed our flight to LAX. In Philadelphia we were given new boarding passes for our flight to LAX. We got 4 seats in four different locations. When we asked the customer service agent at the boarding desk to change our seats to sit us together, she was so rude and unprofessional indicating the flight was full and she was not able to do so. This was incorrect because while we were waiting we noticed she was selling tickets to other people for the same flight as ours. I had to fight for them to rearrange our seats so that one parent sit with one child. It looks like they did not care about our concerns for our children sitting between two strangers in 6 hours night flight from coast to coast.",Detractor
Traveled with Southwest for the first and definitely last time. They are OK if there are no weather emergencies or other issues: that is how our flight from LaGuardia to Denver CO went. They only failed to announce when passengers with small children can board however we managed to be seated together. Staff service was good otherwise the captain for that flight was excellent. We landed as scheduled baggage was out in no wait. On our way back things got out of hand. The notification about cancelled flight came in too late that could offer only flight to East coast to Dulles in Washington DC and that's your problem how you get to your destination (NY greater area). OK can understand they are not responsible for the weather. We got on the flight to Dulles airport. However Dulles control tower had an incident and flight was diverted to the Baltimore airport (which was supposed to be not accepting Southwest airplanes). We waited three hours there to be refuelled and yes you can get out but for your baggage Southwest carries no responsibility. Not a weather related issue now. They claim no responsibility for the baggage. We could not afford a time to travel back 4-5 hours to Dulles airport from NY to retrieve our bags and had to wait. Got there about 2.30 am car rental with our reservation was closed had to spend more time and money for another rental not to mention the long drive to NYC after extra long trip from Denver. I would say that Southwest staff tries their best in the strict company policy limits. But low-cost savings are not actually saving you anything when situations like that happens and they are not worth it. Not flying with Southwest anymore. Do not recommend.,Detractor

" Tampa to Green Bay via Chicago. Where do I even start? First in the line at Tampa a question was asked if any military dependents were flying, yes was the answer so we waited with a giant flashing red light while staff looked at us and continued to ignore us and help even others who had come way after us, only to find out that because the military member wasn't flying it didn't matter. So we waited for nothing and why is that even a question? Then when printing my ticket the United Employee who had ignored us the whole time grabs the baggage stickers and sets them aside by someone else's luggage! Luckily my fiancÃ© noticed and got the attention of a different employee and she apologized for the other employee and put our stickers on in front of us. The flight attendants leaving Tampa were nice at least. We arrive in Chicago, our connecting flight, which we had an hour, but was cut short due to the plane waiting forever, (we as in myself and my 6.5 month old) I change his diaper and put him him the carrier and follow all the signs located in what looks like an area only United flights are...the signs lead me to another security line. Why am I doing this again when I'm trying to catch a connecting flight? The answer the United employee gave me was that I followed the wrong signs. So here I have to go through this again and at this point my plane boards in 10 minutes and I still have to go through security again just to get to the plane. The TSA lady saw I was in distress and helped me as she asked how long I had. Made it to the plane just in time. Again, the flight attendant was very nice. Get to Green Bay, get off the plane and go to the baggage claim where everyone waited almost an hour before bags even started coming. Guess what? Mine are no where in site (one bag and a car seat). Go to the United Ticketing area and no one was there, multiple people at the other airlines and none at the one I needed. Another employee said she was probably in the back and points to the door, we go and look, I see my bags, no employee. Finally a different flight line employee goes and gets her and she comes out rudely as if I'm disturbing her. Get my bags and I'm finally on my way to my destination. I guess since my bags had a car seat they kept them elsewhere, but failed to tell me that? This did not happen when I flew American. But it doesn't end there. Apparently United chose my bag, the one with the car seat, to go through. Broke a few of my things and some of the bathroom items were out of the bags they were put in to prevent any leaking. My stuff was all messed up and I know they went through them because they left a card saying they did. I'm dreading flying back with them.",Detractor

"  I had a perfectly satisfactory flight with British Airways to Boston and back this month (Oct 2016). I slept most of the way had a nibble at the food the quality of which might be declining although at altitude my taste buds are pathetic and had no alcohol. The only reason I fly first class is that the beds are more comfortable than club world and I dislike the club seating arrangement. Apart from breakfast scrambled eggs I hardly eat on long haul. Generally speaking, the cabin crews are good and attentive and it's a bonus if you get some ex Concorde crew. I never want to board the aircraft early as I know that I will not have trouble stowing my bags in first.

The food was abysmal, obvious part of the cost savings announced. The toilets stunk, didn't flush properly. The cabin crew were tired looking embarrassed by the service they had to provide. The cabin wasn't cleared of used blankets, headphones etc prior to disembarking and we had to disembark such a large aircraft through one door at the front of the aircraft.

" Bristol to Malaga. I checked on line 5 days before our departure. Unfortunately I did not realise that my son who is 4 years old was allocated a seat separated from me from the aisle. Once there, I asked the steward if there was anything he could do, since my son starting crying and was refusing to sit next to a stranger and fasten his belt. The steward told me that if I wanted that I should have checked in a month in advance (!) or pay extra! He added that the law allows them to separate the children! Well if there is any law that allows that it should clearly be changed! Thankfully other passengers offered their place and we managed to sit close, but I found this very upsetting and the steward's answer unhelpful. On our way back, at the boarding point families with young children were offered to board with priority, but then they ask us to pay extra to sit close to our children? Is this what EasyJet considers as family care? Or in our society you need to pay for everything! On their website they advertise their service where by paying you can sit close to the people you care most, and the motto is""easyjet generation"". Appaling!",Detractor

They saw me putting the baby on the seat and they make me take him out because they needed to check if the car seat was approved (note: it was our fourth flight and we were coming back home, and just leaving from NYC they check the seat, and of course it was approved). After that another flight attendant asked me again why I was putting the baby on that seat, I told him again because I bought it, I was not going to put a baby on a seat that I didn't buy, well he didn't believe me and ask me to give him the tickets to make sure I was not lying (the flight was full and probably overbooked). After that they stop asking me, but before taking off another woman asked me the same question again and to show her the tickets. We wait an extra hour because of connections.

I have flown Icelandair about 5 times across the Atlantic since 2012. First the positive: at the time it was the only airline which allowed rescheduling of flights for no fee or a very low fee. The lounge in Reykjavik is quite good and the Reykjavik Airport is very nice. There are plenty of negatives with this airline. First of all the planes are quite old and it shows. Staff can be unfriendly if not outright rude. I had numerous delays and one time I got stuck at Reykjavik airport for an entire day. The first alternate plane had an engine failure and the second must have been one of the oldest Boeing 757s in service. I would not recommend them.

CX881 LAX-HKG in Premium Economy. After a number of recent flights on US airlines it was a real pleasure to step on board a Cathay Pacific plane. The PE product is great for the long haul and worth the extra investment. Far superior to BA's equivalent. Only downside is getting out of your seat if you are at the window (or center) when the seats in front are reclined - makes for a difficult clamber over the person in the next seat. Great service - friendly sincere and efficient. The separate compartment on the 777 is a plus especially when sat on the right side making for easy access to the dedicated washroom.,Promoter

"Flew Ryanair Manchester to Barcelona return on 4th August and back on 18th August. I had never flown with Ryanair before, and was not expecting much with it being a low-cost airline. Entering the terminal (Manchester T3) we were annoyed to see that Ryanair checks in all their flights at the same counters, and that there was a huge queue, stretching all the way to the cafÃ©s nearby. We arrived two hours before the flight and the check in queue took over an hour and obviously we were worried about missing our flight. After getting through check in and security we were running to catch the flight even after being sent to the front of the line in security, thankfully we made it. Upon entering the aircraft (B737-800) I was shocked at how crammed the plane was with seats, the legroom was barely big enough to get to the seat (middle) in the first place, but for a 2 hour flight I could manage. After departure we were handed a magazine with a menu inside. The menu was basic and quite overpriced, but I was hungry so I bought a buttered croissant and a tea (same on the way back) for â‚¬3. The flight attendants were kind, attentive and efficient and I received my food very quickly. The food was tasty and the croissant had been warmed. There was a little turbulence on the way, and my tea sloshed a little on me, and the flight attendant quickly helped me clean it up with a smile. After landing in Barcelona we had to wait 25 minutes for our bags to arrive. On the way back to Manchester two weeks later we were cautious and arrived at the airport 2h 30m before the flight instead, but check in and security were very fast and we spent nearly 2 hours in departures, and with big glass windows this was great for me, being an avid plane spotter. The gate was surprisingly in arrivals, and therefore we had to go through security again to get to the plane. After waiting for 20 minutes to board we, along with everyone else were directed towards arrivals, rather than towards the plane, which ended up in a big confusion for the airport staff. Like on the way, the attendants were attentive and kind and although we had major problems with ground staff the airline is very good value for money, and I would recommend it for those who do not have much money to spend on their flight, although if there is a flight with a different airline with a similar price, I'd pick the other.",Passive

"On our outbound flight the crew ensured some people with ""carry on"" luggage checked their luggage prior to boarding. It appears that many of these ""carry on"" suitcases would not fit into the guide at the check in counter. Often these suitcases barely fit into the overhead. We only take on to the flight my husband's CPAP my purse his small back pack with his meds and my carry-on shoulder bag. All these items fit under the seat in front of us. On our way back people had these ""carry on"" suitcases and one woman had 2! Neither of which fit under the seat. I had a man beside me with a large backpack that he did not stow. He left it standing under his legs. As a result his foot was under the seat in front of me! Where are my feet supposed to go? He should have been told to either stow this backpack in the overhead bins if it did not fit under the seat. Then to add injury to insult I was going to put my umbrella into the overhead and was told that it may impede stowing suitcases! When the service came around I asked for a Bloody Mary mix no ice. The flight attendant complained that this would take more than half a can I don't want ice as it waters down the drink and it's cooled enough. I check all airlines to find the best price I can find. For this trip it was Delta (Alaska). But just because I may find a good price does not mean that I should be treated this way.",Passive

Barcelona to Moscow with Vueling Airlines. This is the worst airline I have flown with. Our flight was delayed. Once the plane did arrive it was not clean. The staff were quite indifferent to passengers. There was no food or even water offerred after an initial run just after take off. The tray table was gaffer taped to the seat. There was a patch on the seat. We waited on the Tarmac for a very long time without aircon. After arrival all our luggage 4 cases were missing took 48 hrs to be traced- one case they had no idea where it was! With no Russian it was hard. We had to go to the airport to claim baggage once it was found at our own expense. Have to say though that ground staff were friendly and wheelchair assistance was organised.

"Hong Kong to Melbourne. Seat 32G, last row aisle seat in the premium economy cabin. It seems seats in the last row in PE have better recline than the other two rows. Seats arranged in 2x3x2 configuration. Seat with foot rest, fairly comfortable with good recline. PE cabin completely full. Shared bathrooms with economy cabin. IFE screens good size maybe 11 or 12 inches seem a little larger than iPad. Good contents plenty to watch to kill time. Cabin clean and tidy, bathrooms kept fully stocked and clean. Flight scheduled to depart Hong Kong at 10:20 AM but delayed to 10:35 AM and finally departed after 11am. Arrived into Melbourne after 11pm about 40 minutes late. Pre departure drinks offered but no champagne only water and juices. Hot towel offered only once be nice to have another hot towel service prior to arrival. Once airborne lunch service began. Pre ordered vegetarian meal and served first but after finished with meal stuck with tray for the next hour as cabin crew was serving the rest of the economy cabin before returning to clear trays. Drinks offered multiple times. A male cabin crew addressed passengers by name and introduced himself, very pleasant and professional. Pre arrival meals served two hours before landing. Overall an above average flight with friendly and professional cabin crew. Only minor complaint Cathay Pacific does not know the different between vegan and vegetarian meals. If you order vegetarian meal chances are you will get a vegan meal of pasta with salad and no dressing for main meal and some sort of greasy grilled vegetables with soggy potato wedges as pre landing meal.

" Santiago to Melbourne. First of all, once we boarded and were seated the captain said that due to inconvenience with the aircraft we would have to wait for 30 minutes, this meant that everyone should get off the plane. That 30 min delay turned out in a 6 hour delay. Once in the plane they gave us a menu so as to choose the food we wanted to eat, but as if they were joking us, they later said that they did not have that food because they confused when loading it in the aircraft. After the 14 hour flight to Melbourne and arriving almost at midnight, I received my baggage broken. Customer service people at Melbourne airport were super kind. However, when going to the place where they told me my luggage was going to be replaced, the guy at the shop told me they no longer worked for LATAM because of the amount of broken baggage.

We were told we missed the connection due to bad weather conditions, and apparently bad weather conditions is the fault of the passenger! Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.

Thankfully we had a better airline from Houston home!

"Kamloops to Sydney via Vancouver with Air Canada. I have used Air Canada a lot for my business travel over a number of years, and I have always been satisfied with my experience. Recently, my partner and I planned a trip to Australia for the very first time. I have never flown Air Canada ""internationally"" before so I wasn't sure what to expect. We found our check in online to be very smooth and quick the night before. The first flight from YKA to YVR was smooth like always. The Air Canada employees at YKA are very helpful when it comes to dropping off your bag, and sending the luggage through to our final destination. Once we arrived at YVR (in the evening), we went through security and customs, and then had a nice dinner in the international side of YVR. Our flight from YVR to SYD was scheduled to leave at 11:40, and we left pretty much right on time. We were seated in ""Premium Economy"", and I was very satisfied with the seat comfort and our space. There are only 3 rows of seats for premium economy, which made the long flight comfortable, and less claustrophobic. The service was great, the food wasn't too bad, the entertainment was very good, and the cabin crew checked on us quite frequently throughout our flight. We arrived into SYD in the morning, feeling fairly fresh and rested from our flight. Overall, all 4 flights with Air Canada were very good. Everything was on schedule, and the staff that we interacted with were very helpful to us on our journey. If we go back to Australia again at some point, we will definitely take Air Canada again.",Promoter

My husband and I are members of the frequent flyer group and my husband has the Frontier Airlines credit card. The only benefits are being able to get frequent flyer miles which we will probably not wish to use.

The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered.

The lie-flat beds were a little tight around the feet, and the cabin a little warm for a perfect sleep on the three overnight flights but nevertheless a reasonable number of hours of Z's were achieved. If requested, the crew will leave you asleep and not wake you for meals. IFE had a reasonable selection of recent release and an assortment of foreign films.

On the way back the plane left 90 minutes late, the crossing was quicker at 9 hours, some time was made up, and cabin crew were very good. My main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well. There was nothing at all in my seat pocket, not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there, and wasn't. The catering was really disgusting though. I was served a vegetable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup. Truly horrible, and the worst long haul catering I have ever been served.

" London to Muscat first class. First time trying out first class on BA. Check-in was fairly quick and efficient, didn't have much luggage, but the first wing did not feel very exclusive. I had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as I got printed boarding pass. Concorde room was nice, well designed but quite crowded in some places. Had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace, before it got served a good 20 minutes later. Checkout out the cabana for an hour, which was not very appealing at all, and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment I booked for the Spa. Onboard was informed there was a problem with the Seat I had selected, and was issued a new aisle seat, which was disappointing. Upon entering the first class cabin, I had a quick look at the seat, and it was not immediately apparent, there was something wrong. I asked a crew to check and they came back to confirm that I will indeed not be able to sit there, but there was no explanation of what was wrong given. I did not want to waste any time to settle in, the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read. Seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private, with a small wardrobe to hang jacket. The TV screen seemed quite large and high quality. Unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive, and neither was the remote for the TV. Soon after take off, I was informed I could eat when I like. Arabic starter was great. Had pre-selected main meal online. Meal was of good quality and cooked well. Had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate (not as good as other cheese I've had in some Business class). Surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection, I imagine on two ultra-long flights in the same month, one might run out of anything of interest to watch. After finishing the one film I decided to watch, I decided to try get some sleep. Crew made the bedding while I tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class bathroom. Bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough. I missed breakfast, as I was still rather full from the dinner and pre-dinner at the lounge. Overall, I was reasonably happy with the flight and the product. The crew were very friendly and professional.

Flew from Buffalo to Mumbai via Chicago and AUD. American Airlines from BUF to ORD. From previous experiences with BA and other better airlines I was carefree about connecting at ORD. Only to realize later that I had to go through another check-in at another terminal. Reaching the check-in counters there was a long queue. Apparently everyone was waiting to check-in. So even with the boarding passes I had of AA they meant nothing. Nowhere did anyone tell me about rechecking in. I waited patiently. Elderly passengers who were also connecting from different cities in the US were annoyed. A rude man walked up and asked everyone with AA boarding passes to queue up separately. I was to fit my industry standard carry-on bag in a non-industry standard bag frame. I was told that I will have to check my bag. Having already paid in Buffalo for excess luggage it seemed like a way of making money out of people's miseries. So apparently the check-in was another money collecting routine by the airline. Went through security again. By the time I reached the gate it was chaotic: noise and chaos galore. Onboard the seats were hard space was tight. FAs were nice and pleasant. Inflight entertainment was ok. Food service and drinks service was very good. Liked the fact that they had steel cutlery. Connecting at AUD was painful. Long walk. The walkways were not helpful.

At Jo'burg excellent arrangements for boarding the flight - at Heathrow insufficient space and just chaotic. If Jo'burg can get it right surely BA can get it right at its premium hub - Heathrow?

Instead we had to take the transit to section a go through the long lines of security there and then go back to section c.

Flew JFK-LAX-SYD on the return leg - upgraded to Business on the way back. With the way Qantas have changed their redeeming of FF points it seemed like a prudent investment of 60000 points to upgrade (from Premium Economy). Going through the Express passport control at JFK is so much easier & the BA lounge is quite decent. The lounge at LAX is also good - albeit a little crowded when I was there. Both legs of the flight were really well done (very good crew) and good food - the omelette with fetta and smoked salmon at breakfast before landing in Sydney was especially good. The bed worked well - it is the first time I have slept solidly on a plane (and I have flown in Business many times). It was quite amusing seeing the mature FA wrestle the bed cover on with such vigour! I reckon she could take down any recalcitrant passengers easily!

No notification, I found out via checking the flight status on my phone. The gate sign simply switched over to Memphis. We went to talk with the Frontier customer service agent. We were about 100 people deep in the line and so an agent from a different gate said he could help us. He said the earliest flight back was Monday evening. I told the agent Monday would not work as I cannot miss work. He didn't care. No vouchers. No negotiating. No sympathy. They wouldn't put us on another Frontier flight, connecting or direct. I asked for a connecting flight to Chicago, Omaha, Nashville, Memphis, anywhere. Nothing. Many people around us were completely distraught. Four flights at the very same time left Denver and landed safely in Minneapolis. The airlines were Delta, American, Southwest, and Sun Country. Why would Frontier cancel our flight when everyone else was leaving? Finally, I asked for a refund and rented a car. Yes, I drove from Denver, Colorado, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, all through the night and made it home 15 hours later. Think twice before flying Frontier.

The lowest price was $2 for a tiny cup of coffee or tea. No in-flight entertainment to speak of aside from listening to unhappy customers grumbling and the baby behind me screaming. Absolutely no legroom and I'm a pretty average sized 21-year-old woman. The seats didn't recline not that I would have wanted to lay in the lap of the poor mother behind me. Then I was charged $50 for my carry-on twice after I was told that it would cover all legs of my travel from Portland to Cancun. None of the people employed with the airline were helpful in any way or even seemed to know what was going on half the time. On the last leg on my return flight from Cancun Chicago O'Hare to Portland as well as two others flights were cancelled after being delayed for over two hours. I was not given a reason for this cancellation until I was told by other passengers that the flight staff from the Portland flight and Vegas flight had been pulled to the Houston flight. After that all three planes worth of people went to the desk to try and get refunded for at least the leg that was cancelled or maybe a voucher for a hotel room for the night. I stood in that line from 11.30pm to about 2.30 or 3am. After bonding with many people over mutual disgust of Spirit Airlines I found out that some people had been waiting to get to Portland or Vegas since their flights were first cancelled on May 28th. It was now the 31st. That took care of my idea to just re-book with them for a morning flight to Portland. Next I heard that the vouchers they were giving people for hotels were useless. When I finally got up to the counter the woman was very hard to understand she mumbled so much. At that point I had been up for 40 hours plus and I think people could still understand me pretty well. Overall I feel like I wasted my time and money. I wish I had just paid more for a Delta flight.,Detractor
" Flew Milan Bergamo to Barcelona. I would not recommend Ryanair to anybody. Very bad experience! I know that it's a low cost company and you don't expect much from it but better pay a bit more money and choose another airline. My flight was delayed 2 hours and nobody said anything as to why. The crew were very rude, they seemed very upset and at the end of the flight I asked for water and they didn't want to help, not even to buy and they got very offended when I asked.

"  New York JFK to Ft Lauderdale. I purchased a non refundable ticket in advance and selected a seat (3c) at time of purchase. When checking in and obtaining my boarding pass, they changed my reserved seat to 32c in back of the plane. They had no right to give away my seat as I purchased a nonrefundable ticket. If I wanted to change or cancel my reservation, they would hit me up with the full fare, and if I changed the time or date, they would have charged more. There policy is wrong and unfair. I should have been given the seat I originally reserved. I have choices in the future and will choose an airline a bit more honest than jetblue.",Detractor

The check in and onboard experience was very good I was in the small section in Y on upper deck - paid for but recommended as I slept most of the way to DXB.

I am an altitude member and fly often with AC and somehow have managed to avoid this airline for almost two years and will never take another rouge flight as long as I can help it.

" Gatwick to Paris CDG. The worst airline we have ever flown with after canceling not one but two flights consecutively from Gatwick to Paris, leaving us stranded for two days! Both 21:10 flights were canceled, there was no-one from Vueling at at the airport or by telephone to rebook customers. They knew the flight would be canceled as we could not land at 2am in Paris but did not tell passengers until 11.30pm. The following day, we were rebooked onto the same flight which was also canceled! We were told that they could put us on the same flight the next day at 21.10 (the same one that had been canceled two days in a row) or rerouted via Barcelona, which would take us 11 hours instead of 40-minutes! Another Vueling rep told us over the phone 'I cannot help you'. I don't know how this company doesn't go bankrupt with their lack of care for passengers and constant cancelations. There is also no-one from Vueling at at the airport or by phone after 9pm. Avoid at all costs unless you want to be stuck at the airport!!",Detractor

I flew from Orlando to Barcelona on May 6th with a return on May 18th. It was by far one of my worst experiences in commercial flying. The reasoning for this rating is extensive and ranges from their computer changing my times and seats three times from reservation to flight to inoperative bathroom in flight to massive delays both ways ranging from almost 2 hours to cool down an aircraft cabin before boarding to waiting over 2 hours for flight attendants to arrive in Miami from Philadelphia. It is obvious that no longer is the passenger important but rather all the extra charges and cramped seating that rule the day. In terms of choosing an airline carrier it is sadly my opinion that airlines such as KLM or Lufthansa offer better service and would be my first choices on international flights.,Detractor
" This is the worst airline experience I've had in my life. This flight from Philadelphia to New Orleans was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to book another airline at double the price to enjoy my vacation. The alternative was to switch to a flight two days later when I was set to return home. I then find out other flights are flying into the same location 4 hours later. Why cancel the flight for a 4 hour delay? On top of that, I requested the airline to pay the difference in ticket price due to their decision to cancel rather than delay and was told no. I will never be flying Frontier again. A completely poor company with no reassurance.",Detractor
" Worst BA flight ever! Flew Tampa to London Gatwick. No greeting by the door, shown to economy despite business seat. Dirty plane. Bits dangling from the ceiling. Only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced, which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier. Probably the worst business class seat around, wobbly footrest, facing strangers and having to climb over people. Breakfast was a single, meagre roll with one tiny bacon slice and unbranded ketchup. At disembarkation the crew did help elderly passengers, that was left to other passengers. Crew just stood there. Economy was not held back, so no priority disembarkation. Never again.",Detractor
Bad arrangements if outside the protocol. There were heavy fog in London and due to weather condition flight is cancelled. Reasonable but only one number that can never be connected is given to rebook Germanwings flights or claim hotel accommodation.

I flew from Dalaman to Istanbul and on the same day from Istanbul to Lefkosa (Northern Cyprus) in October 2014. Both flights were delayed by 15 mins on take off but made up the time in the air. The seats were slightly on the smaller side and slightly less leg room than other major airlines but I am not too tall and the flights were short so it wasn't a problem. There are drop down TV screens which showed live flight path speed altitude etc. The Pegasus planes were more modern than the Jet2 planes that we flew from Newcastle to Dalaman. The flights themselves were comfortable (not much turbulence). I had no problems with collecting my luggage. Overall I would highly recommend Pegasus. Remember this is a no frills airline so don't expect luxury. Its simply there to get you from A to B in one piece.,Promoter

" Arrived at Perth for my return trip to London LHR to be advised that the flight was delayed by 2 hours. As a consequence I would miss my connecting flight at Hong Kong (HK) so they had rearranged this. This resulted in a 14.5 hour stopover in HK. I was not happy and clearly distressed. I advised them I had a health condition and could not sit in an airport for 14.5 hours. I purposely chose a stort stopover (and paid a premium for it) as long haul travel is challenging anyway. I was advised that I would be put up in a hotel in HK airport. On this basis I took the flight. On arrival in HK there was no hotel. I was however given access to the Business Class lounge. Whilst this was very comfortable, I still had to sit in the airport for 14.5 hours. I am not happy. I have repeatedly asked to discuss this with someone at the airport and have been given a customer comment form to complete and post off! This is not helpful! Even if they do respond it will be far too late to rectify this situation. As far as the outward journey went, I must admit to not finding it as good as previous trips. Previously, I would have said Cathay Pacific was not far off Emirates & Singapore A/L but even based on the outward journey alone I would no longer get say this was the case. Food disgraceful.

" Kuala Lumpur to Osaka via Bangkok. The flight from KL to Bangkok was fantastic and crew were so friendly and smiling. Can feel their passion in serving the customer. Though it was a 2-hour flight, they managed to serve everything smoothly until landing. Second sector was from Bangkok to Osaka. Crew were like robot. Not even ask the passengers about their choice of meal and directly give passengers whatever the meal they are holding. Crew were not seen serving drinks during the mid of the flight. No warm towel prior to take off and landing. Inflight entertainment was passable. Seat is comfort. Third sector was from Osaka to Bangkok. Some crew were very rude. Rushing for the meal and expecting the passengers to finish it quickly. Even heard a enior crew raised her voice to at least three passengers, ""Finish? Bring this go there (finger point to the back galley) I won't come back again, understand!"" The flight was six-hour long and why don't give some time for the passengers to enjoy their meals slowly. No beverage serving / crew going round the cabin with drinks in the mid of the flight. Crew takes long time to answer call bell. The same goes to the last sector. Rushing to do their service and very impatient. Few times I observed the crew can't wait to push away the cart perhaps the passengers were still thinking of what the crew were saying or couldn't listen to it clearly. For money wise, yes it's cheaper than some other airlines. In terms of inflight entertainment, it's not as interesting as SQ, EK or CX.

Flights on time both ways friendly staff seat comfortable enough for a 2-3 hour flight. One big plus with Ryanair is seats do not recline.

The day of my flight when I went to check in my bags the staff was rude and other customers were treated poorly as well. My flight was delayed three hours because ATC had to route my flight to Houston because of storms. I am under 5 feet tall and I felt as though the seats were too small and there wasn't enough room. When I sat down I came to realize that the plane was filthy. My next flight was also delayed and the customer service reps were rude and kept us in the dark. My flight was scheduled to leave at 9 PM but we ended up leaving at close to 1 AM. I might as will also have paid for bigger airline since they nickel and dime you for everything.

Mumbai to Jaipur. I am a frequent flyer on this particular route. I prefer a low-cost flight on this route as the journey time is just 2 hrs. IndiGo is not a full-service carrier but one thing is for sure if you are booking an IndiGo flight be sure that you reach on time. They have a record of on time departures. The ground crew and cabin crew is well-trained and swift and helpful. The only place where this airline lacks is the entertainment system. The magazines provided inside are good enough if you are in India for a vacation or a tour. The airline connects almost each and every airport of India. Also they are flying to some international destinations like Dubai. They also provide free reminder service for your flight and the communication system between airline and consumers is way too good.

The screen in front of the seat is a low resolution and small. You can barely see the movie on the screen. The screen was also bad in the next leg as well. The problem began on the 2nd leg, Abu Dhabi to Bangalore. The flight was full. There were a lot of carry-ons on board. There was nearly no space in the compartments. I had to put my bag four rows behind me. I looked at my seat number and found out it is a window seat, not an aisle I selected when I checked in online. Three kids took my seat and requested me to swap with another middle seat. Four hours in a middle seat was really annoying. I ordered water before serving the meals but the flight attendant told me to wait for a while since they are preparing the meals. I had to wait for more than half an hour.

When we finally got to the front of the line at 1:29, the employee told us that we could not get on the flight because checkin had closed at 1:25. She told us we should have gone to last minute check-in around the corner. No one told us this option existed. Three different employees failed to give us the correct information, and checkin closed while we were waiting in line to check in. When we went to the customer service window, the Vueling employee refused to put us on a later flight for free, and instead tried to charge us over 200 euros. He was incredibly rude, saying that we were lying about what time we arrived at the airport. I tried to file a claim on their website, but it does not work for me. I called their number, and the woman told me to use the website to file a claim. When I told her the website doesn't work and that's why I was calling, she hung up on me.

"  Singapore to Doha via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways. It was nice experiencing Etihad's 787-9. The Business Class layout was much better than other airlines as it gave more privacy, also the IFE offered on this aircraft is much better than the rest of their fleet. The seats are wider but very firm and I could only sleep laying sideways. The cabin service is nice but cannot be compared to Cathay or Singapore or even Garuda and Etihad needs to work on this. The food choice was wide and since I was in the Far East for over a month I choose the Gnnochi to change my palate, but it was an awful choice and I could not even have two mouthfuls. I am not going to blame Etihad for this, as there were safer choices of noodles or biryani but I decided to be adventurous! The flight was short as we had a strong tailwind.

Initially we were excited to fly with British Airways as it would've been our first time flying with them and also they fly a B747-400 from Denver to Europe. I am aware that the Boeing 747-400 isn't the newest aircraft, however Lufthansa had re-done the interior with new seats and side panels so very up to date inside. With British Airways the whole interior was very old and dirty, the seats hadn't been changed and the TV's in the back of the seats were such poor quality it was embarrassing. The food was of a poor standard - chicken meal I had was horrendous and even the flight attendant didnt know what she was serving. When asked what chicken dish it was, she replied ""some sort of curry thing"" when it was actually Chicken Teryaki. The air hostess was rude, the breakfast snack which was served before landing was also not very good, and cereal bar was rock hard. British Airways were double the price of Lufthansa when we initially booked, however I would never choose to fly with the again out of my own choice. Their Boeing 747's are dated which is a massive shame. Stick to an airline you know well, Lufthansa are the best European airline all round that I have used, and Emirates was the best internationally. I hope this review was helpful - obviously I am aware some customers would have had a better experience than me on newer planes with different food and air hostesses, however be aware when booking with British Airways as they are very over rated and not good value for money.",Detractor
BKK to SYD. Again no AVOD system. After contacting the Thai airways office directly before booking my flight I was told we'd have the AVOD on the flight. No AVOD! this is the 3rd time in 3 years this has happened. The aircraft was old and seats were worn the padding in the back of the seat was compressed so much that it was like leaning on a rock. Staff were fantastic and food was ok.,Detractor

LGW-VRN (Gatwick-Verona). My first trip with Easyjet and I will admit to a sense of trepidation using a budget airline with a bit of a reputation! Carry-on only so I did not have the apparent burden of queuing to check a bag. I also used the speedy-board option which avoided the one gripe I would have: people boarded the plane from both front and rear but without any consideration to seat allocation meaning that people were trying to pass each other in the aisle with bags in hand - close to mayhem. Seats were comfortable and legroom good (I'm a reasonably tall person) flight attendants very friendly and helpful. In summary I was pleasantly surprised.,Promoter
"  A320 from Aberdeen to Gdansk. The price of the ticket was around Â£30, Â£13 for the ticket, Â£12.50 for large cabin bag and Â£6 for seat 11F. Security at Aberdeen Airport went very fast. The size of everyone's bagage was checked at the gate and if it did not fit there were fees of over Â£50 to pay. Some passengers had to pay the fee and the atmosphere at the gate was not nice. I waited in the hallway for around 35 minutes before being allowed to board the aircraft. On board the cabin was dark and gloomy with very dark purple seats. The overhead lockers were full and the flight was 100% full. Seat pitch was terrible and there was hardly no leg room. The seats did not recline, were very uncomfortable and there was gum on the tray table and the armrest. After departure the crew started going round with the buy on board in-flight service and the duty free. The flight lasted less than 2 hours. We landed early at an extremely foggy Gdansk. I passed customs and I had to wait around 8 hours at Gdansk to catch a LOT flight to Krakow the next morning. I would say that the price I paid was worth it, even though the service was not great. One thing I would say is before flying with Wizzair you should always check their cabin bagage policy to avoid paying a Â£50 or more fee at the gate.",Passive

"Flew EWR-KEF and KEF-MUC on Economy Class. Reading some reviews I expected a bad experience but everything was fine. Checked in with my mobile phone in EWR, unfortunately the TSA couldn't read the ticket so I had to go back to the Check in counter to get the boarding pass. Flight was on time and the crew was very friendly. Got an emergency exit seat during check in for free, so I had enough space but the standard Economy seats looked like they have good pitch. The only thing I couldn't deal with was the mood light, but I donÂ´t like it on any airline. I just prefer a dark cabin during flight. Boarding the first flight everyone got a bottle of water, which was refilled during the trip, the crew offered drinks a few times during both legs. Food was for purchase and rather expensive but booking on the airline's web site I knew that before so I had a nice dinner at EWR and bought some chips for the second leg to MUC. KEF is a very small and pleasant airport for transit. From the moment of disembarking to my connection flight I needed less than 10 minutes. I will definitively fly Icelandair again in the future, yet the planes are good and the two crews that attended my flights were excellent. And with 380 EUR the price was more than good.",Promoter
I flew with Qantas recently on the Sydney - Queenstown and the Christchurch - Sydney legs with a couple of infants. Though I had pre-ordered the food online 72 hours before the plane departure from my frequent flier account the staff on the plane didn't have the update and hence my children were served the normal food. During the return leg I had chosen the seats at the front-end of the aircraft and yet they put me at the back-end of the aircraft which was a bit disappointing. The lounge facilities (Gold member) at the Sydney airport were excellent whilst the lounge facilities in Christchurch could be improved a bit especially for the kids.,Detractor
" Athens to Larnaca. Aegean is a very professional airline, I have experienced many many flights with them, aircraft though cramped are in excellent condition, flight attendants are given top marks, whilst snacks etc at least on some routes are getting below average, for example on this flight we were given a tasteless small piece of bread which looked like a pie.. As on many airlines you have to pay for check in luggage, pay for a seat if you choose the first 12 rows etc. In general a punctual and reliable airline, but ever so often they avoid jet step walkways and this is my constant complaint, as it has happened many many times especially on this route to Larnaca, or even Munich and London.. On this flight for example we arrived under torrential rain, the airport at Larnaca was half empty and Aegean parked at a distance, go down the stairs, get wet, into the bus and then the drive to the underground entry to the airport.",Passive

VIE-YYZ on a B767-300ER: the check-in experience at the new Star Alliance terminal in Vienna is far from optimal but the trip was OK. Even the older 767s have good seats with adjustable headrests. Personal IFE is not genuinely on-demand but still provides some ten video channels playing in a fixed loop making it possible to catch several movies throughout the flight. There are even live feeds from two outside cameras and an air show channel. Food is good with fresh Viennese rolls and great salads by DO&CO. Arrival to Toronto slightly ahead of schedule. BRU-VIE on A320 was a standard 1hr 25 trip. No entertainment but the slim Recaro seats provide good legroom and a small sandwich plus beverages are provided free of charge. The only downside was the 70-minute delay without as much as a word of apology from the crew.,Passive
"Frankfurt to Hong Kong and this Cathay Pacific flight was a pleasure. Check in at FRA was a very nice experience. This was a weekend lunchtime departure and the area at Frankfurt Airport near the gate was quiet, even though the retail areas of the airport were busy.

"The only reason we went with Sunwing after reading several bad reviews was the decent price. We were aware that Sunwing was notorious for delays, but decided to take the risk. What a mistake we made. Our original departure time was 3.45 pm. Under an hour before we were supposed to board, we were told that there was about an hour and a half delay. Not too bad yet. However, as time passed, the delay got pushed further and further, until finally, our new departure time was 1.00 am. This was a complete nightmare for all passengers, including those who had very young children. Instead of telling us right away that our plane would be delayed until such a late time, they kept us at the airport, waiting, with very little information as to why the delay happened. ""Compensation"" was $20 meal vouchers that were useless at the time, since most of the restaurants in our area were shut down for the night. We also got $75 vouchers for excursions, but it still did not make up for a day of our vacation ruined. Two weeks later, on our way back to Toronto from Holguin, our plane was in a similar situation. First a four hour delay. No explanation. The delay once again got pushed to later times, until it was over five hours of waiting in our hotel lobby without air conditioning. New departure time was 1.45 am. In conclusion, we will never fly with Sunwing again, as it seems that customers are the last thing they worry about. With huge delays and no communication between the airline and the passengers, Sunwing is not a good option in any shape or form.",Detractor
  Thai Airways service from Hong Kong to Tehran via overnight layover at Bangkok was mediocre in terms of crew service and time management. It has come to my concern that Thai has had serious delays at HKG recently on their service to BKK. Crew was mostly unhelpful and quite rude and robotic in their attitude when asked for an immigration card. The only reason to keep me flying with Thai is their newly introduced service to Tehran via Bangkok and also their top-notch gastronomic experience which was on par with my past experience flying on their Economy and Business Class.,Passive

Flew LHR-IST on 737-800 Business Class. Inflight Entertainment was OK. Seat comfort was not great and the recline angle very small on this aircraft.

We did not know that we had to download an app on our phones to see a movie and when we did, the movies were so old, we did not bother with them. As meals go, we had a small meal which was chicken, a cold piece of bread, some kind of salad and a small cake. As I said this is a 9 hour flight, so we get breakfast if you want to call it that.

Check-in was uneventful in FRA used the Sakura lounge (JAL). The business class product on this new A330-200 was superb. The business class section is divided in 2 sections: 18 and 12 pax in a 2x2x2 configuration giving a very cosy and warm atmosphere plenty of space. This aircraft is equipped with proper full flat bed. The bed is a good 2 meter long about 50 cm wide (maybe more) the seat fairly wide (although narrower than SQ) which should not be a problem. We had all the amenities you can expect and a very soft comforter and pillow. The food was pretty good. we were offered a pre-dinner drink and a selection of Chinese style or western style food was available. The crew was available during the whole flight at the snap of a finger. The only negative points is that we were rushed through the meal. We had to slow down to make them understand there was no rush! Although the crew was nice trying their best to be polite and use proper English to get understood some lacked the elegance to provide a high standard service. The entertainment system was pretty good a large screen great picture and good selection of movies. Overall it was a very relaxing flight very good value for money in Business Class.,Promoter

Flew QF702 MEL to Cairns and QF703 Cairns to MEL. The two flights were as different as chalk and cheese. Flight up was not enjoyable at all. The food was an inedible tasteless disappointment with no choice as to what you would like. Lucky we brought some snacks from home! No seatback IFE only a shared boring movie on a screen I could not even see. Come on Qantas entertainment is available on Jetstar for a cost but who cares. How can you expect people to just sit there for 3.5 hours. The small shared screens are an absolute joke. Please either use newer planes with IFE flights 3+ hours or give out ipads Q streaming as is done on the 767. Flight back was on the new VH-XZO with IFE and the food was a lot better and with choice this time. What a difference it was like flying a completely different airline.

Will recommend mainly on the basis of safety and punctuality.,Passive
" I understand that Sunwing ""charter"" can cancel flights on short notice (note terms and conditions permit any schedule changes up to 12-hours prior to flight). However, this should be a rare event (as reliability for most airlines is important). If it's too frequent it makes their schedules and bookings are effectively meaningless (but if you as a customer want to change your flight you pay a massive cancellation fees). Only book with this airline if you are OK random and substantial schedule changes. What is not OK is for Sunwing to cancel flights and not tell either their own customer service staff or customers immediately. When contacting their customer service agents they pretend/think/believe flights are still scheduled (eg. YVR-YYZ JUune 7 7, 2019). Contacted customers service twice and both times stated flight was still going - despite cancelled prior to Monday May 20. You have to then demand the customer service staff check and tell them you know the flights been cancelled before they will double check the status with Sunwing flight services/scheduling directly. At which point they confirm - yeah flight has been cancelled. It appears as though, Sunwing wont contact customers until the last minute - see other complaints (4 days prior to flight) where it is possible that Sunwing knew well before that time that the flights were cancelled / changed / rescheduled already.",Detractor

"  London Heathrow to Warsaw via Paris VDG. Booked outbound flights with Air France via their partner KLM's website. This meant we couldn't choose our seats at the time of boarding. However, online check-in opened 30 hours before departure and we could change our allocated seats at that point. We were happy with the allocated seats on this occasion. Air France website was easy to use, and the check in process was very simple and quick. Printed our boarding passes to minimise queuing at Heathrow (outbound travel was with hand luggage only despite paying the extra for checked baggage). Stepping onboard our flight to CDG we were met by two smiling cabin crew and directed to follow the queue down the single aisle. The onboard team were friendly and courteous. During the 1 hr flight, a full bar service was offered, plus we were given a small chocolate muffin. Given the short flight time, the captain announced we were beginning our descent before half the passengers had been served. It can sometimes appear that in order to offer a ""full service"" to passengers on short haul flights, things seem so rushed. In no time at all, we were back on the ground and taxiing to the gate at CDG. Flight no 2, to Warsaw was slightly different. As we boarded, there was only one flight attendant, and she was talking on the phone so the passengers just walked passed without the usual greeting. This was the first time I have experienced this - there are usually two attendants at the door so even if one has to take a call, the other performs the customary welcome. I noticed that with both flights, the pre-departure safety announcement did not feature instructions on use of the life jackets. This flight was longer, so the bar service and sandwich (choice of salmon or cheese) was more relaxed and enjoyable - so much so, I requested a second bottle of wine. There were only two lavatories onboard meaning a queue formed at times. If there was anything to improve these two flights it would be a few small screens to show the flight route. It gives passengers some kind of reference while we're cruising above the clouds. All things considered, I enjoyed my first experience of travelling with Air France. I have read various reviews, but the product they offered ( two short haul flights at a reasonable price) was pretty good in this instance, our flights got us to Warsaw slightly ahead of time which was our key concern. My main reason for choosing particular airlines is a combination of cost, service and flight times. For us, flight times are the main factor - we can usually trade off a higher cost against better flight times, and for short flights, the service doesn't to be anything special. I would certainly consider flying Air France again if their schedule meets our needs in the future.",Promoter

Flight attendant forgotten to come back for tea and waited 10 minutes. As soon as arrived in Abu Dhabi we got to the coach to go to Dubai which is a hassle. They told us that it will be in Dubai international airport drop off zone, but instead got drop off at Etihad Travel Mall, which meant we have to get a taxi to Dubai International Airport to pick up our hire. In general most hotel have service to pick up at Dubai international airport which save $$$$. So if you ever fly to Dubai take an airline which lands in Dubai airport.",Detractor
  Birmingham to New Delhi. We have not yet flown but in the past 3 months have found Air India the worst airline I have ever booked with and I am well travelled.

The priority service (which makes it possible to take the hand luggage on board) at extra cost provide literally no benefits apart from what should already be in the price and becomes a commonality rather than an exclusive feature.

"  San Francisco to San Antonio. I have never know a company that has shot themselves in the foot more consistently than United Airlines when it comes to customer service. My latest experience with United Airlines has pushed my husband and me over the limit. We will no longer be traveling United. The last several times we have booked tickets through United, we have selected our seat assignment, and every every time, United has moved us from our original seats. We have tried changing our seats back on line, with an agent over the phone, and with an agent in person. I am always given an excuse as to why our seats have been changed and why they can not be changed back. Today's flight was the same, our seats were moved, only this time, my husband and I were seperated. I spoke with an agent who could not help me. I asked to be transferred to a supervisor. A supervisor was extremely rude. She was defensive and condescending before she even tried to help. Finally, I was able to explain my situation. She told me the UA website clearly states seat assignments are not gaurenteed. I suggested that choosing seats should be removed from the site. Her answer was, â€œNo that won't happen, the site says there is no guarantee. Your seat was changed and I can't change it back.â€ I asked to speak to her supervisor. Her response, â€œNo, you may not speak to anyone else.â€ I asked for her name",Detractor
"  AirAsia is by far the worst airline experience I've ever had. I had four AirAsia flights in the last week for my trip to Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur and Penang and back to Changsha) three of which were delayed. The ticketing process is set up to be easier but many of the automatic machines were not working and we had to ask several staff members for help before we could print tickets. On the first 2 flights, the staff were unfriendly. On the last flight the staff were friendly but seemed exasperated by all of the requests of passengers. Carry on bags should be only 7 kilos but only one airport weighed our bags and made us repack them. There is no unity among the airline. Every airport has a different request. AirAsia is cheap because they offer you no amenities included in the price. Checked bags, food, and drinks are all an extra cost. Passengers may order food and drinks and pay cash on the plane but it was not an organized system. People were crowding the aisles and shouting at the crew to get what they wanted. The chairs are quite uncomfortable, when it was time for landing, I didn't even realize my seat was reclined. Many of the passengers used their cell phones at inappropriate times which made me very uncomfortable. I would rather pay for a more expensive flight than take AirAsia again.",Detractor

Privacy could be obtained by closing the door, like the first class suite in Emirates first class. The service was excellent, with extremely attentive and courteous crew. Meal was good, with the option to dine at any time. Loved the entertainment on board- the selection is huge. Everything was slick and span!

"Amsterdam to Sydney via Guangzhou, and very impressed with China Southern Airlines. The staff were exceedingly friendly and attentive. No problems getting extra drinks etc. The food was nice, and a good selection of drinks available. I've been learning Chinese for a while now, but this was my first opportunity to put it to the test - they were very surprised, and supportive of my broken attempts. The IFE was pretty basic, and quite hard to operate the touch screen, which seems to be a common thing on airlines with no hand-held device to pull out of the seat, but with a bit of work it's possible to find a good selection of movies. I would definitely fly with China Southern again.",Promoter

" Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. Oman Air has disposable earbuds, they should learn from that. 7) Food was awful. They should learn from Etihad or Qatar.

We also received an ice cream which was very tasty. Crew was good and friendly. Only drawback are the very few drink rounds that were made during this 11 hour flight. We were seated on the upper deck on row 74. A very big advantage is that the seating is in a 2-4-2 configuration and the window seats have a very nice 'bin' were you can put all your stuff.,Promoter

I don't want credit as the meeting is canceled and there will be no future flight in the near future. I called my credit card company as I used my mileage to buy the tickets, and they can only refund my miles if AA refunds my ticket purchase.

"Flight 871 from Minneapolis - Denver repeatedly delayed hour after hour after hour. 2.55pm flight was finally due to be in Minneapolis at 7.53.

Said that they would do their best for a quick de-plane and have us in Denver at 9pm a mere 5 hours after we were supposed to be there. Ten minutes later gate agent announces the flight is cancelled. No explanation. Since we were only taking a two day trip this destroyed the weekend. Then a badly-managed group shuffle to the ticket desk where five Spirit personnel stood around for ten minutes presumably to figure out what they were allowed to say and do. Long story short not much. No vouchers nothing to recompense us for hours waiting and a ruined trip no effort to find us other options beyond ""there's another flight tomorrow"". Just a refund and the ticketing personnel handled the entire situation poorly (or resignedly). When we told people we were flying Spirit to Denver we heard two people say ""Oh no. Bad idea. Get ready for a lot of delays."" We were sure it would be fine. It wasn't and the kicker is that it was ineptly handled. I have had some delays in many years of flying and I understand mechanical issues and weather happen but they are generally handled in a manner that suggests the company would like my business in the future. Due to the very poor experience I will never book with this airline again and I will be vocal with my results in booking with Spirit today.",Detractor

When they basically say that this is the only next available flight we obviously take it, but it also gets canceled. I've traveled with Allegiant and have had flights canceled due to weather, but they provided a hotel and even vouchers for our next flight.

I have flown with Air Baltic for many years and generally there are no issues with time keeping and technical faults. On board staff are generally helpful. Customer Service could be better especially at check in in Riga - often long queues that merge into one - airport check in area is rather small and often the queue is out of the door so it pays to arrive earlier. Airport airside is pretty good now with the addition of new shops. I generally travel the London/Riga/London route which is nearly always full. Tend to be expensive at times - out of season usually the better deal. At least assigned seats - unlike the free for all on Ryanair in which case if you are not Latvian or Russian you will not win because they are queuing for plane 30 mins before boarding starts - look out for the passengers who stand up immediately the wheels touch the runway preparing to get off - it always amuses me.,Passive

LH458 MUC to SFO A340-600. Business class without the new seats actually a rather inferior product and the new seating needs to be much better. Mediocre food with a veal dish for the first meal that consisted of two bites of dry overcooked meat. The meal before landing consisted of curry wurst and a small salad. Really German food is great but curry wurst as the featured food on a $5000 round-trip ticket? Service was sufficiently warm and efficient.

" Venice to Paris. Vueling told us that the flight is cancelled due to bad weather, however, I am wondering how is it possible that only our flight was cancelled in the entire airport that night (31 August 2018)? The rescheduling of this flight was two days after (2 September 2018 night), which will cause me and my sister missing the international flight from Paris to Hong Kong (CX278). Right after knowing the flight from Venice to Paris is cancelled, I talked to Vueling staff about the rescheduling, they said they could not help me to change the tickets, but I can call the Vueling customer service (which she claimed that it is a 24 hours hotline, but in fact it is not). She suggested me to change to the earlier flight at around 9am the other morning (1 September 2018) which will go from Venice to Barcelona and from Barcelona to Paris. Despite the hotel was assigned to us at 2:30am and the bus arrived at 3:30am, we still tried our very best and managed to get back to the airport to try to catch that flight at 6am. Unfortunately, when we reached the airport, Vueling said it is impossible to change the flight from one journey to two journeys and asked us to go to the ticket counter. Ticket counter then said Vueling have the authority and they could not help. We were then being kicked backward and forward without any help. We were very angry and disappointed about the service provided by Vueling. The staff was unhelpful and rude that morning (1 September 2018). We eventually have no way to go to Paris in time , cause the ticket office said all the flight from all airlines were fully booked. We therefore have to book the flight ticket from Venice to Hong Kong directly. We have lost a lot of money because of Vueling's odd decision to cancel the flight which other airlines didnt encounter that night. We lost our hotel fee in Paris, our missed international flights to Hong Kong, also, Vueling took us to a really far hotel situated in Bolognese and had not included any transportation back to the airport (so may I know what is the claim that you will include the transport between hotel and airport if it's only one-way). it costed us 60 EURO to come out from the hotel to the airport that morning to catch the flight that Vueling staff suggested, which, not to mention, it became an 'impossible' change the other morning.",Detractor

A Singaporian doctor suggested that Spanish speakers were given priority. After making enquiries as to how long we were going to be stranded as it was now over two hours with no news, we were still told no information. Met the doctor again waving a form at me ""get one of these and demand it is stamped to get the compensation as per EU law also get your food vouchers"" this is what we did. Had we not been advised what to do by this kind lady then we wouldn't have known what to do. Eventually we were put on a later flight but missed our connection to Gatwick. Could have caught a Norwegian flight at a cost of EU460 each, no way so we stayed at a hotel and flew Norwegian the next day for EU270 each. The Veuling staff were courteous but offered no assistance, tried to contact Monarch but no numbers answered, no help lines so they were of no use.

LHR-FCO-CTA return in June. Overall it was a good experience but in the months between buying the tickets and the actual flights they changed our itinerary 3 times. This was due to departure time changes and eventually cancellation of the domestic leg. These changes were communicated to us in email and in Italian language without offering alternatives refund or assistance. Bag drop at LHR a bit chaotic as Alitalia operates several flights in the morning and it seemed not enough desks were open. We ended up waiting 40 minutes in the queue before getting fast tracked along with other passengers on the FCO flight. At FCO they seem to operate a coach service for every single flight. One flight out of 4 was significantly delayed (FCO to LHR). I liked the generous legroom on board. No sandwiches given out like BA does on European flights only a small pack of crisps and a drink.

" Flew United Airlines from Newark to Tampa. The worst experience with an airline I've ever had. They do not allow disabled people to board first, nor if you have a child over 2. The seats have arm holders that do not lift up so with a small child who is scared or a person who is larger and needs more space, it's not an option. You have to pay for carry-ons and pay to pick your seat, in addition to your ticket. So awful. One agent even threatened to refuse a woman on the plan for the size of her purse. As a disabled woman traveling with a child, I'm extremely dissatisfied. There were several great agents before we got to our gate which is the only reason this rating is not 0.",Detractor
CDG-VIE took this morning flight and it's so disappointing to see the standards drop so low. For breakfast if you don't drink Tea of Coffee it's Bread (croissant) and water no juice of any kind. Crew look suitably embarrassed. And you have for the inflight entertainment the reading of their Air France magazine. The paper cup and napkin is collected in a rubbish bag very quickly after serving and then the crew disappear. Virtually a low cost company.,Detractor
"Unfortunately AC has discontinued service of their full service line from YYC to LAS and there is no choice but to take Rouge. I have travelled in Premium Rouge once before and while I also disliked this Lufthansa short haul version of business class the economy service takes the cake! Seating is the most horrifying experience imaginable. I can honestly say I have never been on a plane where the seats were so uncomfortable and had such little room. I didn't even realize my legs had cramped up due to not being able to move until I tried to disembark the aircraft. I am 5'11 and my knees were wedged against the seat in front of me. I could not move my legs underneath the seat in front of me. I had used my frequent flyer comps to get a free meal from the BOB service. Even though I was the 6th person asked if I would like something from the BOB service my choice had ""just run out"". So I was stuck with a backup option. Additionally I told the FA that I had a meal included with my ticket and he did not believe me. I had to disrupt the people sitting next to me to reach my bag and dig out my boarding pass to show him the meal logo on it. I watched another FA scream at a passenger who desperately needed to use the lavatory because the seatbelt sign was on and ""Your seat is the safest place for you! Please sit down!"". The lack of an entertainment system is aggravating. I knew of this before leaving for my trip and am not willing to pay to download AC's not free entertainment app on my phone so I brought my small laptop to watch some movies. There was not enough room between the seats for me to open the lid on the laptop all the way. Of course all of this might be made tolerable for some people if the fares are discounted as you would expect on a self proclaimed ""discount airline"" Unfortunately I have been flying this route every 3 months for the last 4 years and can tell you the prices are exactly the same as what the full service AC has been charging. In other words a total scam. Never will I ever fly this airline again.",Detractor
" Barcelona to Porto. My experience with Ryanair was terrible. Staff were incredibly rude during baggage check, payment and boarding.

When contacted they don't speak English (just Italian, i don't understand italian). When you will check the website for the tickets on same date, tickets were available but were 5 times more costly than for what i have booked.

"  I traveled Milan to Chennai via Delhi. Not much to complain except the total lack of communication for baggage picking and delay announcements: in Milan I was told (several times) that my luggage would have been sent directly to Chennai, but I had to collect it in Delhi and checking it in again before departing to Chennai. Moreover, the flight to Chennai was heavily delayed and we had no info from Air India while waiting for it. Seat was comfortable enough, I had better experience but there was room enough for my legs (I'm 1.83m tall). Food was actually very good: I opted for the vegetarian meal and it was tasty and abundant. InFlight entertainment could be better: plenty of Indian movies and old international ones but few choices for the new international movies.

I have travelled EVA many times usually Premium Economy occasionally in Business and in general seats are comfy food is decent and staff is very pleasant. My complaint is about the website which is one of the worst I have ever encountered and far and away the worst airline website I have ever used. Maybe the Chinese language site works better? The English site is horrible. It took me hours to figure out and book flights. Then I couldn't select seats so I called the 800 number and was told that aisle seats were requested for me. Today 3 days before flight I got an e-mail inviting me to select seats on the website. Trying to log in using confirmation # and name (exactly as on ticket) and they couldn't find my name.

Flew in July and August on various Swiss flights - mostly in business. LAX-ZRH and ZRH-SIN were both fantastic on A340. The flat bed is 2 metres long as very comfortable when flat and in seating position. Staff were very good and nothing was too much trouble. It would be helpful if there were 2 pillows per person as when flat the 1 small pillow isn't sufficient to get comfortable enough. not a problem when flight isn't full but when it is none spare. Also flew GVA - Athens and Athens - Zurich in business. Typical short haul flights but very comfortable in business and excellent food and service. Lounges also great in LA Geneva Zurich and Athens. For the price charged Swiss is an amazing option. Also flew 1 leg Nice - Geneva in economy and couldn't fault anything.,Promoter

There were no apologies or any answers to my emails. This is the second time I have used Sunwing and they have changed departures 3 times out of 4. I am not retired with lots of time to make changes.

"Flew Premium Economy LAX-HKG-LAX on 777-ER. I have read many prior reviews about CP PE and the main point is that this product should only be compared to Economy not Business Class. I have also flown CP BC and it is a great experience all around. I am 6'2"" and the days of flying Economy across the Pacific are over! Understanding that the price can be about double after 15 hours I believe well worth the price. Was able to board early on both legs. Had a dedicated overhead bin. The private cabin in a plus. The seat was fantastic 34C which was back seat aisle. A bonus was the extra storage behind the seat. Even when the seat in front was fully reclined I never felt uncomfortable. The width of the seat the arm rest and comfort of the seat were all good! The entertainment system was fantastic! The noise cancelling headphones were excellent. I found the service to be adequate the food options were the same as BC including the wine options. Real silverware and linen. Had no problems getting drink refills or snacks. Had no problems sleeping had superb legroom. The adjustable headrest is a great plus! Able to de-plane ahead of EC which is nice. The extra price was definitely worth it to me as I felt completely rested after both legs which is invaluable. Also you if you have the opportunity to use SkyPier at HKG do it! Less than five minutes to get through immigration customs and security! Amazing experience! The check-in desks at SkyPier are efficient and fast!

Flew from Las Vegas Nevada to Costa Rica with a layover in Panama City Panama both going and returning. I got to experience their best and their worst. Flying from the States to Central America Copa used their most modern aircraft. Seats were comfortable space was good and the stewards were friendly accommodating and provided excellent service. Individual entertainment screens were located at each seat. Each passenger selected their own mode of entertainment (movies music games or following the flight via a map). Both English and Spanish was offered. Earphones were provided when boarding the plane. Blankets and pillows were waiting on each seat. Very comfortable with a thumbs up for Copa for my 1st experience with them. Returning to the States was a nightmare. Copa used very old outdated aircraft. They needed extensive cosmetic repairs. The flight leaving Costa Rica at least had pleasant stewards. Stewards flying from Panama to the States were not. They did not assist to keep the plane clean on a 6.5 hour flight. If garbage found its way into the aisle they stepped over it each time it was encountered. By the end of the flight the floor was overcome by trash including the bathroom floors. They spoke and understood English when it behoved them to do so. One entertainment screen existed every 3-4 seats. Three movies were shown all in Spanish and all without English subtitles. Earphones were passed out after the first movie started. There was not enough blankets or pillows for the number of passengers. Very uncomfortable environment for a 6.5 hour flight. Thumbs down for Copa on my last experience with them.,Detractor

Flew to Cape Town from Manchester via Paris. All flights were good as regards take offs landings etc. The Manchester to Paris and return flights were comfortable with enough room and an attentive cabin crew. The long haul flights were cramped and uncomfortable. The cabin crews were offhand and the food awful (from a French company). Some of the choices were non-existent and whole rows of passengers missed when drinks were offered. The announcements were too quiet to hear and said at such a speed that even if audible it would have been impossible to understand them.,Passive
Cathay did provide the best service between New York and Hong Kong. The service by the mostly Hong Kong crew was excellent. The Cathay chef knows how to concoct those airline meals. The small portions are just what I want on a long flight. If you want more there are noodles freely available. So is the champagne wine and Johnnie Walker. Everything comes with linen and silverware. The movie selection is huge and power is available for personal electronics. I usually manage to sleep half of the flight very nice. My last flight Hong Kong to JFK via Vancouver in January began well in business class but soon went downhill. I was late boarding and the head purser made me a beautiful mimosa joking that the look is what counts. It was just the kind of nice little touch which makes for a great flight. Surprisingly the food went downhill from that point. For the first meal I ordered the filet - it was cold overcooked and tough inedible. Hours later the next meal was the same. The duck was greasy stringy and tough. I noticed that the entrees were lined up open on top of the trolley before serving. Passengers at the rear got cold congealed food! Because they were slow with the service the food cooked too long then sat open the whole time. I tried to refuel with their ever available noodles but these came mushy though fragrant. Very frustrating. Except for the one purser who did not appear again the entire cabin crew was new. Looked like they are training a whole new crew for this cabin. I've flown Cathay for years and years and I know they will fix it. But meanwhile methinks Singapore or EVA for a couple of years might be good for me.,Detractor

Flew to and from Punta Cana from Gatwick. Two good flights. Orderly check-in. Great crew. Food mostly quite good although if a salad is going to comprise a few lettuce leaves and a chopped up tomato frankly don't bother. Flights pretty much on time. Both very busy. Breakfast on arrival in London was poor too. IFE is horrendously behind competitors. Really dire. Ran out of options after about half an hour. Some airlines offer thousands of films and programmes. The crew are the best part of BA as the seats and catering are not up to much. Check in was excellent at both ends. There was a minor system glitch at Punta Cana which meant a short delay but a member off staff came through the queue to keep us all informed. Top notch.,Passive
I've been flying for over 30 years and I have never come close to missing a flight. In April 14 I travelled with American from Miami to Washington DC and their awful check in staff caused my group to miss our flight. There was a cut off check-in time of 9.13am and we arrived about 8.55am and were told not to go the counter but to use self- check-in. We did this and when it came to finalising the check-in the system cancelled our check-in. Again we went to the oh-so-friendly staff which said go to the counter as it will be quick and there is not queue. Went to the counter and by the time we had got through the queue we were 3 mins past our check-in time. The staff couldn't have carried less and just flat out refused to help even thigh it was their fault. We were told that we needed to book in 2hrs before the flight but not only was this not listed on our ticket but our pre-printed boarding passes had 9.13am.

"  Flew from Fort Lauderdale to Hartford. First I want to say there were no problems with the flight. We left on time, arrived early, and the staff were all very nice. This review is based more on the value for the money. We flew from CT to FL and had a great trip down with another airline at a comparable ticket price. On that flight there was wifi, small tv's for every seat, and the seats were quite comfortable. The trip back with Spirit was very different. There was no entertainment at all, the seats were one step above sitting on hard plastic, and you have basically no leg room. While these things are far from an actual issue what gets me is that you get nickeled and dimed to the point that Spirit is as expensive or in my case more expensive than flying with an airline with much better accommodations. After purchasing the tickets I then found out that luggage was twice the cost of the other airline ($45 for a carry on bag), and I also had to purchase a seat ($20 for the cheap seats). Wasn't that what the cost of the ticket was for? Again I didn't have a bad experience with Spirit but I think you'll find much more value with other airlines when you look at the all in cost.",Detractor

You pay for reserving seats, on shorter flights you pay for food, etc. The seating on the Boeing 787 seemed very cramped. It is said to be 31"" but seemed like less. On the return flight on May 3rd, two of the lavatories went out of service. The A320 from London to Prague seemed to have more seat room, but the seats were very hard. They may be the new ""slimline"" seats, I'm not sure, but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight. Also, on the Washington to LHR flight we had printed out boarding passes at home. The agent at Washington printed out additional ones and said we should use them, but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and none for my wife. It was lucky we still had the one we printed out at home. I won't say that I will not fly them again, but I will definitely compare prices in the future. They aren't worth any extra cost.",Passive

"  Miami to London Heathrow with British Airways in First Class. The boarding process at Miami was chaotic with the staff member inviting World Traveller Plus, Club World and First Class to all join the queue to board. Despite flying First Class it took 15 minutes to get to the front of the queue and a further 10 minutes on the jet bridge before getting onboard. The crew were indifferent and we were not escorted to our seats. The ""hot"" towel service before take off was a cold dry towel which had not seen any hot water. The ""hot"" nuts were served 10 minutes after the drinks. The meal was dry and of poor quality. The cabin crew forgot my partners main course and put one in the oven 30 minutes after everyone else had eaten and when it was served, it was cold and inedible. When the crew member made my bed up I was informed they had ""run out"" of duvets and the crew only managed to find one after I complained about the poor experience to the CSM. Based on this experience, BA's penny pinching across all of the cabins has lowered the quality of all of the product and it is not worth paying for First Class - save yourself some money because United Airlines Economy Class is better than what I experienced on this flight.",Detractor

Considering you get food and beverages and earphones at no extra cost whereas other cheap airlines charge you pretty much to do anything but breathe I can't complain. Just think of it as a budget airline and you'll be happy!,Passive

"Was leaving Beijing to Singapore on Air China with my family. We check in 3 hours before our departure at gate E26. Less than 45 minutes before departure, the gate changed to E51. It happens sometimes and as usual, the announcement is not clear. To go from E26 to E51 is a long way as we are not familiar with airport terminal 3, I understand later there is a short cut to go to E51. But you only have less than 45 minutes before departure to make your way to E51, We just follow the signboards instructions. We were rushing from one end to another. But what really annoyed me is that there is not a single customer service officer/staff at the gate E51. A customer service officer appeared about 10 minutes before the original departure (1535 hrs). This is the first time, I have encountered such poor quality of service from a national carrier. The flight was delayed about under 2 hours before departure. Their ground operation's customer service quality is appalling.",Detractor
United Express: I flew from ORD to ASE in March and although they have us over a barrel as they are the only airline with non- stops the flight wasn't bad.

The seats did seem smaller but the service was jut about the same as its big brother. The fare was on the high side though.,Promoter
"Booked an AC Vacations package and got rouged. I'm average size and had about 3"" of knee room. Seat was uncomfortable outgoing I had a knee massage from the tall man seated behind me who was clearly struggling in his seat. My partner was served cold coffee and got a shrug when we mentioned it. A women in the row ahead was served cold tea and the flight attended loudly blamed the passenger for putting milk in the tea. Late in the flight I happened to see a flight attendant racing through the cabin silently waving a water jug in front of her body.

Don't they think that their valued frequent flyers could be bored on having the same dessert in every single CX flight? Entertainment choice as always not the best but good enough.

" Amsterdam to San Jose via Seattle. In several years of traveling, I have yet to have a problem free encounter with delta airlines. This most recent trip has had two flight delays, one that caused us to have to take a shuttle to another airport to get a different flight so we wouldn't miss our connection and the other over 2 hours delayed.

Make sure you understand the bag charges and pay for them if you can before you leave your house. Otherwise it will cost more at the airport.

Perth-Sydney. Flight was on an A330-200 but we had to change planes because of malfunctioning landing gear. So I went back to the lounge which was ok but had a very poor food selection. We then changed planes to a former Jetstar A330 and got upgraded to business there were no TVs but rather iPads which didn't bother me. We then heard because of the delay we have no catering because it would take too long to load the food on the plane and if we put the food on we wouldn't beat the Sydney airport curfew. Because there was no food they had to use leftover pretzels and drinks from the other flight. Then when we taxied to the runway we had to return again because someone dropped their headphones which stopped the door from closing then we finally took off and the flight attendants didn't want to be disturbed (which I don't blame them) but they where still quite responsive and they had a great sense of humour.

The planes are new offering ample legroom - on the flight back we were offered emergency exit seats with no extra fee- which was really nice of them.

" I have just tried to check in on line for a forthcoming trip to Milan with Ryanair, having had the debacle of trying to sit together with friends - this is just not possible unless you pay extra up front again!! Thought I had solved the problem by paying an additional Â£6 PP Per flight for priority boarding. Only to discover that due again to their policy change this no longer includes early check in. The only way to sit together is to reserve your seats. Which is also a cheaper option than priority boarding but it doesn't tell you this when you make the booking. It is also not possible to change your Priority boarding to reserving a seat! The other point worth mentioning is that when you do book in the 4 day period before you fly, the Ryanair system seems to be designed to ensure that you are as far apart from your family as possible, which causes chaos at boarding as everyone then boards the flight and tries to sit with their family. If I have a choice Ryanair will be my last choice of carrier. No longer the cheap option they once were - they give you the distinct feeling they are trying to rip you off. Most certainly the worst of the cheap airlines! I will not use them again unless there is no other option - even if I have to pay more for the flight. Don't try to complain on the phone - they have no complaints department, just someone who keeps on telling you their policy has changed and to look at their website if you want to complain.",Detractor

"  Los Angeles to Tokyo Haneda. American Airlines had my flight schedule from Denver to LA at 8:25am and give me a layover of 8.5 hours at LA to Tokyo which I do not understand why, why give me a flight that connects to another flight that are so far apart. On top of that they delayed the flight from 6:35pm to 10pm and give us no legitimate reason on the extra delay. I could have worked the day and gone on a later flight to connect at LA then head to Tokyo, but I have to be stuck at the airport for 13.5 hours. Their customer service representatives at LA were rude. A horrible airline, and terrible customer service. I don't not recommend anyone taking this airline anywhere - just expect delays like I did with no help or other flight solutions.",Detractor
LYS-BRU-LHR first flight on Avro RJ100 second on Avro RJ85. Good flight though 2nd a little late due to aircraft late arrival. Both crews professional and friendly with interesting en-route information in 3 languages. Food and drinks prices correct despite limited choice. Good value but long transit in Brussels (4 hours). Luggage delivered quickly in LHR.

" Havana to London via Madrid. We queued for three hours in the most awful, disorganised queue at Havana airport to check in (we checked in at the time we were supposed to take off) and unfortunately the experience didn't improve once we boarded the plane. Shortly after take off we heard very strange noises followed by two massive drops where the plane literally felt like it was falling. Passengers were screaming and there was not one message from the pilot or cabin crew to reassure us. We could see some lightning outside and only assume that the sounds we could hear were hail hitting the plane. As for the drops I have never experienced anything like it and was terrified. I feel it was awful that there was no announcement from crew to reassure passengers who were clearly very distressed. Other than this there wasn't enough food served and it was disgusting. If you press the call button no one comes to see if you are okay. I had to go and find cabin crew in the kitchen to ask for water. Will never fly Air Europa again!",Detractor
SYD to SIN on A330. Seat was horrible! I arrived in Singapore with sore thigh. They should have installed a footrest! Flight attendants were neither polite nor impolite. No smile no expression (except one cheerful lady). Seems like they are forced to do their jobs. I requested for special diet as I am a vegetarian food was edible but nothing special. Entertainment options was OK however the system is very slow difficult to navigate and very outdated. Some other domestic Qantas fleet has been equipped with touch screen entertainment system so why retain this old remote style IFE on-international fleet? Considering that the price that I paid wasn't cheap and with the same price I can fly with another airline with a better reputation I am expecting a better service.,Passive

As we hadn't done this before I arranged with the purser for this to happen. Pure luxury and outstanding customer service is the only way I can describe it. As it was an overnight flight (12 hrs), we were given comfortable pyjamas and our bed made up whilst changing. The staff were amazing - so friendly and helpful to the highest quality. We may not ever get up the front again (1st class) but we will never forget the experience with China Southern. The only problem is the setup of Guangzhou airport - what a stressful situation.

 Frankfurt to Stockholm. Exceptional customer service. I travel a lot between Germany and Sweden I often use SAS. I have always been happy with their services and rarely had problems. This time I travel to and from Sweden with a dog. On my way to Sweden my check-in bag unfortunately got broken. In 5 min the very helpful airport staff had replaced my bag with a comparable new bag and I could continue my journey with no delay. On my way back to Germany the corner of the dog cage was broken and deemed non-reparable (the dog was unharmed and did not seem stressed by the incident). The staff at Frankfurt airport created a damage report. Less then two hours after I emailed the report to SAS I received a nice email apologizing for the damage on the cage and a promise that full refund of the value of the cage will be transferred to my account the dame day. I will continue to book SAS. I can strongly recommend traveling with SAS!,Promoter
" Munich to Barcelona. When I read negative comments about Vueling Airlines, I was hesitant to fly. But the flight was much better then I expected! There wasn't any problem during boarding. It was really systematic (The window seats were boarded first and the aisle seats were boarded the last). The take-off was almost on perfect time. But the flight was rather bumpy because of the frequent turbulence. When a flight attendant realized I felt nervous, she offered me water, seated me in the front and kept eye contact with me throughout the flight. Landing was also punctual. Overall, it was a very convenient flight when you think about the value for money. I will definitely fly with Vueling Airlines again.",Promoter

Flying now United Airlines round the world starting from Europe. Never again on a UA flight unless it is the last choice. They started me on a feeder flight from Oslo to Frankfurt only to tell me that they pushed me 24 hours on their flight to Chicago because they simply cancelled the flight that day. I did not accept and got across with Air Canada but ended in Toronto rather than USA. Had 5 internal flights in the US scheduled time seems an approximate time not a target for UA. I boarded in Washington on UA803 via Japan with same flight number going to Singapore. After boarding we sat excess 15 hours in the plane awaiting for UA to finish their maintenance. Arrived Tokyo only about 40 minutes late but was told too late to board the 803 flight to Singapore. On arrival I had a good 30 minutes and only hand luggage. Tough luck same flight number means 2 different airplanes on the two legs and no margin to be late crossing the Pacific. 6 hours waiting with shifting to Haneda.

Stansted to Ercan via Istanbul with Pegasus Airlines. First crew not very helpful and hardly spoke English at all. The Pegasus Cafe booklet shows if you buy 2 bottles of JP Chenet it will cost you 10 euros for the 2. We wanetd 2 bottles of white. There was no white wine left by the time the crew got to us and we were only in row 7. So we asked for 1 rose and 1 red but according to the very arrogant young man we could not have them both at the cheaper price. He said you can have 2 white and he could not understand that he had no white left that's why we asked for the other 2. I know it should not bother me but it is a matter of principle as on the way back we asked if we had 2 different ones would we get the cheaper price and was told yes of course. The rudeness of the crew did not help the situation. In fact the flight left Stansted 1.5 hours late. Somebody stayed on the plane at Istanbul instead of getting off which caused another further delay as the headcount had to be done 4 times and by then the pilot had missed his take-off time and we eventually arrived at our hotel at 12.30 in the morning from a 1.30pm take off flight.

" I booked a ticket via American Airlines for Qantas flights for a trip. I was flying from Cairns through Brisbane and Los Angeles to my final destination, San Diego. The flights were OK, nothing to rave about. The seats seemed smaller and more cramped other international flights I had taken. The food was too salty and lacked texture, but otherwise was fine. The attendants were kind and polite but a bit too strict when I asked for a drink (""Sir, you cannot have two drinks at the same time"" when I had about 1 or 2 sips in the bottom of the dinky cup, which I effortlessly finished on the spot). However, my main qualm with Qantas is with their ""Customer Care"" and agents and representatives. While I was in the air from Cairns to Brisbane, Qantas cancelled my flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles, and I received a notification when we touched down. Naturally, I was confused and annoyed - why did they cancel my long-haul flight and why didn't they tell me before I took off from Cairns? I called Qantas who said it was cancelled for ""operational requirements"" but I could take a flight the day after (wouldn't work with my schedule) or connect me through Sydney at a painfully early hour in the morning. However, I had to call American Airlines to actually book the seat. Since Qantas and American Airlines had literally zero communication and little to no knowledge of what was going on with my original flight (Qantas said they could not notify American Airlines and I had to call them), I had to spend about 4 phone calls and 2 hours on the phone trying to fix the issue. I eventually booked new flights that added about 12 hours of additional travel time. When I tried to speak to a representative on the ground at the Brisbane airport, he was incredibly unhelpful and curt (I'll cut him some slack - it was 4:30 am). He could not tell me why the flight was cancelled, could not file my complaints, and could not provide any information except ""Qantas has a process and the process works."" Well, I can tell you first hand that the process is extremely convoluted and difficult and does not actually work. I spent several weeks trying to reach Qantas ""Customer Care"" before I heard back. No resolution has been reached for a flight two months ago. Tip: skip the mess and reach out via Twitter. Or just fly with a different airline.",Detractor
" I flew from IAD to TLV via SVO on April 15th, arriving on April 16th. 2 out of the 4 bags I checked didn't make it (along with many other bags from other passengers that were all making claims at the same time that I was. It took 8 days to finally get my bags (my trip was only 12 days long). During those 8 days I sent emails, faxes and called the airline and lost baggage service (Q.A.S) multiple times and never received any responses. The only reply I got from them was due to a Facebook message I sent, which explained I need to contact the airline directly, not through their FB page. On April 24th I decided to go to the airport and look for my bags myself. They claimed my bags were not there, but I begged to check on my own and was finally allowed. Well, they were sitting right there in their storage room! It seems that when the bags finally made it on a flight, they had new tags put on - meaning the airline would have never found my bags, since they were searching for my old tag number. When no one claimed the bags, instead of searching their system to look for my claim, they issued a new claim to the case even though my name was on the baggage tag! Now, I flew back the same route arriving 4 days ago (TLV, SVO, IAD) and 3 of my 5 bags checked are missing! They claim it was due to a short stopover, but I had a 14 hour stopover!

"  Moline to Salt Lake City via Denver. I had a very unpleasant experience with United Airlines on September 18, 2017. I was told that because I was two minutes late, my seat was reassigned. It was unclear that I had to be at the gate 30 minutes prior to my departure and if I were late my seat would be reassigned. On my confirmation email, it clearly states that my seat will be automatically assigned prior to boarding and can't be changed once they're assigned. Thus, I had to take the next flight at 5AM. When I was on my flight the next morning, I asked the flight attendant if I could move two rows back because the plane was not to capacity and it would be more comfortable for both myself and the gentleman next to me. I was told by the flight attendant that, ""They had already made a count and that the weight distribution would be off"". Having flown previously, I've moved seats before with no issue. Because of these experiences, I don't feel that United Airlines values their passengers and therefore, I will no longer book with them.",Detractor
" Abu Dhabi to London. Etihad have recently cancelled the ability to book / change Economy Class seats free of charge before the flight. What is worse is that when you try to book a seat using their useless ""Guest"" program it simply loads a splash screen saying ""unable to manage booking"" so you are left wondering if there is a glitch with your ticket. My ticket was issued early July and I changed the seat on my outward leg no issue. Turns out that this new policy was introduced from July 10 so because my return leg is late August I have to pay to change my seat. That seems doubly unfair as the ticket was purchased with the understanding that seat changes were a free option. To rub even more salt in to the wound apparently you can check in 48 hours before online but you can only choose a seat for free 24 hours before. So you are left with a Mexican stand-off between checking in and being auto allocated a seat or checking in ""late"" after selecting a free seat from a depleted choice! Cynical or what?

" Liverpool to Dublin. Ryanair have carefully designed significant financial pitfalls into their customer experience. 6 months ago, they removed the ability to take any practical-sized hand luggage on board without paying extra for it. As a 'sweetener', this additional cost granted you Priority Boarding. However, Priority is the new 'Normal', because 80% of travellers actually require a usable sized bag. The other rip off is the fee if you forget to check in within 2hrs of your flight. I have used Ryanair all my life, to regularly visit family in Ireland, and go to destinations in Europe, regularly noting their desperate and greedy attempts to extort more money from their customers/captive audience for things that were previously included within the ticket price.

Ground service from Phuket to Bangkok far exceeded my expectations. Due to unforeseen events I had to cut short my holiday in Phuket. My connecting flights (Phuket-Bangkok via Bangkok Airways and then onwards via a different airline) had a very tight window of 1 hour and 5 minutes. This was a fault on my part but the staff went out of their way to make sure that I would make it on time. I was given a seat in Row 1D to be able to disembark first - upon disembarking a special car was waiting to take me to the terminal building right away and a very efficient lady escorted me to the other airline's counter negotiated with them and directed me to immigration.

"  London City to Dusseldorf return, flights operated on behalf of BA by Eastern Airways. The cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases. Cabin Crew must of been members of the Basil Fawlty school of Catering. The outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us. The young stewardess took our orders, then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped one of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal. The meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented. On arrival at Dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal. The arrivals boards in the airport say terminal B and we were dropped off at Terminal C. Our delivered to terminal C and we had to walk to Terminal B if you were been met. The return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that BA is becoming famous for at overseas airports. Check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to LCY and 2 hours before the flight to LHR. I can see that this was a money saving wiz by the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf. As the flight to LCY may only have max 100 pax and they would of been able to see the flight loading the day before. The check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on Club Europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle. Which looked totally out of place in uniform. The flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals, which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called Ham & Chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days. Again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on budget airlines such has Wizz and Ryanair, in fact they have better staff than Eastern Airways so these crews maybe the one who have failed these airlines selection process. I was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed. On arrival at LCY it become apparent that the ground handling agents at Dusseldorf had failed to load all the bags for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind. The handling agents at LCY could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the bags followed on the next flight. I did phone on Monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system. This morning I spoke to a member of senior management at Dussledorf Airport. About 4 hours after this call the bags had been found in the baggage handling area at the airport. They will be put on the late flight tonight which means I will get it nearly 4 days after it became missed.

"  Edinburgh to London City. Despite having a confirmed booking, when I attempted to check-in with a prepaid-for bag at 1535 at the EDI airport for a 1655 flight to LCY (domestic flight) I was told I couldn't as the flight had been oversold. I accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with Flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldn't be authorised so I had to â€˜wait'. I then stood around for 10 minutes, being asked to â€˜move out of the way' at one point because I was blocking others. I was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details (despite what the BA website claims should be done) and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves. I was simply ignored until I approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor. None was available nor could be contacted, apparently. I wasn't allowed to transfer to the Flybe flight â€œin caseâ€ a seat became available on my original flight, so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in. I was told to wait for another 20 minutes. I argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given I had a confirmed booking in the first place but I was basically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and it's not their problem that other people had checked-in before me. I was treated as a nuisance. At one point, there were 5 members of BA check in staff doing nothing (nobody else to serve) whilst I was just standing silently there â€˜waiting' and being ignored. After 20 minutes of not knowing what to do, my original flight closed and I was approached by a supervisor (who suddenly was available to talk to me) and given a seat. I asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier I had been told the flight was already full with no seats available. He explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in, and as the check-in was closing, they could give me the seat now. I informed him that I resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier (though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous) and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings. I had done nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily, like a problem rather than a customer. I then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure I was not denied boarding at the gate for being late (even though I had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally, especially for a domestic flight). As I told the supervisor, if the airline treats its customers with such contempt, do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt. Under their current policy of overbooking, passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not getting a seat at all, even though they have a confirmed booking. Some would call this cheating. The saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual, and unlike mainline BA, this route is run by its subsidiary BA CityFlyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient. I rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in.",Detractor
"People are complaining about WOW airlines because they don't know that its business model is very different. Once you understand that everything has a cost, and the cost is very expensive, then you can fly cheaply as I did. Note that a bottle of water costs 3 euros. I saw a lady buying two bottles of something that is free most everywhere in the world. The only thing that is free is one small carry on that weighs less than 10kg (22 lbs). Such a deal. It went up from 5 kg the first time I flew WOW. Obviously, with all the restrictions, you have to plan ahead. For me, WOW fits my expectation of an airline, that is, inexpensive RT tickets. WOW is notoriously late, so if you book your own connections, plan on a wide connection timing. Otherwise, you will have to rebook your connections at full fare. That will definitely increase your blood pressure. For a solo traveler who is on a budget, this airline is perfect.",Promoter
 Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi. Even if the Check-In was pretty fast the staff was unpolite and hard to understand. Boarding however was starting early and as a result of it it was completed 10 minutes prior departure. In my opinion the Economy of Etihad is good. Entertainment has a huge variety. The flight crew was alright however the scale is -1 since several crew members were busy checking their whatsapp messages instead of saying goodbye to the passengers upon arrival to AUH.

The ground staff were very nice and cabin crew pleasant and efficient. My hot entrÃ©e was on board and the meal very tasty. Again, my only complaint was the in ceiling screens - couldn't really see all that well. I didn't even bother using the ear buds at my seat. forgot to mention, blanket was also at the seat upon boarding - as well as my 2 outbound flights.

I travelled with LH1402 from Frankfurt (Germany) to Prague (Czech Republic) on June 23 scheduled 21.55-22.55. Due to late change of aircraft from the planned Airbus A321 to an Airbus A320 Winglets the flight was slightly delayed but the flight managed to depart before the awful night ban at Frankfurt Airport. The aircraft was only one week old according to the crew. That was obvious everything was extremely tidy and clean. However no IFE and still the same type of Recaro seats with any support for your head which I find very uncomfortable below industry standards. I was seated in Business Class on seat 4F and the service were excellent. Even on this very short flight a very tasteful salad was served and before the meal drinks were served. Right the way it should be drinks before the meal. An excellent flight and a very good experience and the cabin staff even addressed you by your name when serving excellent.,Promoter
"When I was searching flights between NYC and Oakland, CA, Spirit was the least expensive flight I could find but the many problems I faced made this a more expensive flight than direct flights! The website did not disclose how many stops there would be to and from my destination. The stops were disclosed (NYC/Detroit/Vegas) when I paid for the tickets - I did not read the entire 4 page print out of my ticket at the time but found out the night before the trip that I would have to pay $100 for my first checked-in luggage if I don't check-in online. You will pay for your carry on (besides a purse, briefcase or a small backpack). When attempting to check-in online, the website will give you the option to sign up for membership for $9 so that you pay less for your luggages/seats. However, when you try to pay, the bill is for $69. I declined because the savings would not justify the charge for membership. Besides by this time, I felt so taken advantage of that I did not want to be a member anyhow. They charged me for a middle seat (never had to this before). The seats were tight and did not recline (new experience). They charge you $3 for a drink, no movie/radio stations. Overall I paid more for this flight than a direct flight where I could've watched a movie on my reclining seat and getting served water/tea/coffee! The flight attendants were nice (probably because they did not really have to do anything!) and no issues with take-off or landing!

"  Frankfurt to Shenzhen via Beijing. The key to tolerating a long flight is a good entertainment system since you are stuck in the plane with nothing else to do. I was shocked and disappointed at how bad the in-flight entertainment was! It's a small screen that was extremely pixelated, not touch screen, with a wired hand controller that dates to pre-internet days where you have to tab-tab-tab-select and oops you missed your target so start all over again tab-tab. The choice of movies and shows were kind of okay but catered to the Chinese. They also provided English subtitles but as the resolution was so poor it's not possible to read them! The more recent movie choices in English had the qualify of having been pirated. The audio was just awful. I gave up on the entertainment system an hour in, and read ebooks off my tablet instead! In this day and age, such a bad quality entertainment system is just unforgivable. The Chinese food was not too bad. The seats were just ok for an average-sized person but when the person in front of my reclined back, the entertainment screen was practically in my face and I had to in turn recline all the way back so I would stop kissing the screen. They wouldn't let anyone use any phones, even in flight mode! I would only fly again if there was a huge difference between the cost of their ticket and that of a more reputable airline. There are no USB hubs, and don't get excited when you notice there are power supply outlets under your seats, as they don't work! Our luggage arrived on time with no damage.",Detractor

"  Reno to Dallas. Do not fly American Airlines. As a young first time traveler I was unaware of how poor customer service would be. We came from Reno trying to get home to Hartford which requires a connecting fight in Dallas Fort Worth. My younger sister and I got to our first gate no problem where they spent 20 minutes begging people to check luggage causing the line to back up. The plane took off late. We thought it wasn't a huge deal because we had time between flights. Both flights were booked through American which I thought would make them a little more aware of delays with other planes. Myself and 6 other very kind people missed our connecting flight to Hartford all on the same plane. We landed and sat on the ground for 25-30 minutes â€œwaiting for a gate and crew.â€ They closed our flight because we got off the plane too late by no fault of our own. They then sent us to customer service where we waited in line for about 40 minutes for them to tell us the only other flight to Hartford was at 7:30 am the next morning where we again would have to get on a connecting flight in Chicago. The people were terribly rude at the desk where they then told us it wasn't their fault and we would have to cover all our room costs to stay the night in Dallas. Flights are not cheap making this service completely inexcusable. It would be a whole different thing if this was an inexpensive product. My sister and I ended up pooling all our traveling money together to spend $90 to stay in a room over night. I wish I could give them zero stars. To be fair our flight there was not something to complain about, but they have lost my business forever. Not to mention all the other people on my same flight who missed their connecting flights. With this first hand experience I would never recommend American Airlines to anyone who would prefer to not be treated like a piece of luggage themselves.

First time on Qantas business overnight from SIN-MEL. Lounge at SIN overcrowded and noisy so moved to Emirates lounge. What a contrast! An oasis of comfort and attentive service and almost sorry to leave when flight time arrived. A330 business cabin one of the dullest and least appealing we have experienced but seat comfortable. Supper menu was a joke and by the time my wife and I came to chose our preferred choices were unavailable. My wife ended up with a crew meal not too bad but really is this what flying business class is about? We have flown business on 5 other major carriers and this experience puts Qantas right at the bottom as far as my wife and I are concerned.

The staff were incompetent. (At the airport I asked if I could upgrade. And after 3 attempts including trying to overcome the language barrier with the supervisor I gave up). The food was inedible. You know it is bad when you choose the pasta with seafood and the flight attendant asks ""Are you sure?"" and shows you the food before giving it to you). The seat was uncomfortable. (Old material not enough legroom). The in-flight entertainment was unviewable and had the worst English dub ever.

"  London to Cochin via Delhi. Since advertising the Boeing 787 as their flagship plane I was looking forward to flying the aircraft for the first time. However to my surprise it was probably one of the dirtiest aircraft I have been on. Airvents had so much dust accumulated that the vents had turned black. Broken trays. In my experience the airline had good punctuality in this flight however I would be cautious if booking with them to check for delay patterns. Staff are somewhat helpful however not very welcoming or engaging. Felt they were really there just to dish out the food. Did not get a single response from any stewardess on the aircraft on all occasions of travel when using the assistance button in seat. Inflight entertaintment is probably one of the worst. If you are flying I would suggest downlading your favourite shows or movies beforehand. USB charger ports were not working in my friends seat, so he had to use mine, while my entertainment screen buttons were broken (physically broken). Overall I would not fly with Air India again unless I have no other option. I would rather pay an extra few quid to avoid the dirty aircrafts, crew and having to transit in Indian Airports.",Detractor
I have flown SIA for years in and out of Asia. Usually good service but I have found it difficult to understand why they still have some old aircraft's flying routes - it does not represent Singapore well when it has one of the best economies in the world. The frequent flyer programme seems to have been altered also over recent years to make it so much harder to get gold status unless you pay lots more for tickets on economy. Recently I have noticed that they are handing out in-flight earpieces that I have had a bad experience with and dislike. Two flights recently when I used these I could not hear the movie clearly at all despite trying a new set. From then on I ask for the old headpiece sound sets which work well. Surely SIA can provide the best headpieces to go with its 'image'.,Passive

" Lima to Cusco. I was happy to see that the tour agency that booked all my tickets booked me on Avianca, as they were a star alliance member. This meant I could use my Royal Orchid Plus Gold privileges. Our whole itinerary was from Buenos Aires all the way to New York City, making stops along the way. One thing that made me wonder straight from check in was the matter of people trying to cut queues by going to the Business class line. I went up showing my gold bag tag (I had lost my wallet hence my gold card) and the guy still asked for my name. This happened at two of the three airports I had to check in at. Star Alliance lounge in Buenos Aires is crowded not because of lack of capacity, but because too many priority pass users were getting in. When I went there they had stopped admitting priority pass but thankfully my star gold status was enough to admit me plus my mum. Due to the amount of people, I could not connect to the lounge wifi. That is quite a bummer for any lounge. Boarding was organised from A to F, with star gold getting group B. I actually liked this more than boarding with business class passengers as you can board in a more orderly fashion.

"Minneapolis to Chicago on American Airlines, in Economy class on a vintage MD80. Friendly check-in, where the agent worked with me to avoid the USD 100 surcharge because my hold luggage was initially 8 lbs over American Airlines 50 lbs. limit. This was appreciated. After that the experience became distinctly mediocre. Once boarding was completed the pilot announced that there will be delay due to a maintenance issue that they have not been aware of before. So a packed plane waited for the maintenance issue to be solved, which thankfully â€œonlyâ€ lasted 40 minutes. Plane has obviously not been cleaned in MSP, as the seat pocket was full of stuff including used tissues and something sticky and disgusting. Otherwise the flight was uneventful. Legroom was ok due to Economy ExtrAA seats, but service was very average. Flight attendants not exactly unpleasant, but not particularly friendly, either and not doing more than the absolute minimum. No snacks were served (also not expected as this being the US and the flight time was below 90 minutes). Drink service was limited to coffee, water and orange juice, which is pretty poor for a flight of this duration. Bags out fast in ORD with priority bags first. In general the flight as such was OK. Pretty much like taking a bus. However, due to the delay a lot of people were very anxious to reach their connection out of ORD. The only assistance from American Airlines staff seemed to be an announcement to â€œremain seated, if you do not have a transfer connection to catchâ€.

" Toronto to Haiti via Miami. This review is based on my unfortunate experience with American Airlines starting the day of February 7th, 2019. I was travelling with 4 other female medical students from Toronto to Haiti to complete a week-long mission trip in Cap-Haitien. While boarding our connecting flight in Miami, we received word from Haiti that the country was now under protest and rioting in the streets and there were no vehicles allowed on the roads. There were barricades blocking the road to and from the airport and they could not find a company to pick us up. We immediately notified the AA gate staff and were assured that there was nothing going on in Haiti and it was safe to fly into. They were actually arrogant in their attitude and stated, â€œobviously we would know if something was going on, we wouldn't fly into Haiti if there was.â€ They made us feel like we were stupid children. After boarding, we begged the American Airline attendant to please speak to the pilot to contact the Cap-Haitien airport and verify the information we received. Within minutes he returned explaining that they had heard nothing was going on. At that point, we had to trust the airline and flew into Haiti. Upon arrival, our worst nightmare came true. The country was in violent protests, rioting and fires everywhere. We could not get out of the airport. It didn't take long for AA to rid themselves of any responsibility and they flew out, taking any hope we had of getting out with them. The airport tried to shuttle us out on an escorted shuttle, but we got attacked and had to return to the airport. Shortly thereafter, the airport closed. We had to either sleep outside the airport or try and pay someone to escort us safely out. We did the latter and ended up having to go to a hotel in the hills, away from our compound, clinic, and the patients we came to help. After 2 risky attempts where we had to return to the airport after getting stones and glass thrown at us, we reached our hotel. Fast forward to 4 days of trying to get back to the airport and out of Haiti, we called American Airlines several times to please come back and get the people who were left stranded there. We were told repeatedly that this was not their problem and that we could change our flights but at a cost. After several days and attempts to get past the fires, barricades and violence on the streets, we were able to get to the airport and catch a flight out. We were told verbatim that as long as it didn't interfere with their flight pattern, what was happening on the ground in Haiti was not their problem. The hardest, and scariest thing to believe is that there was apparently no communication between the airports. I mean, it's a freaking phone call!! I believe that American Airlines knew what was going on and just didn't want to cancel that flight. I felt so unsafe and alienated, while they just flew off and didn't give a care in the world about their passengers. Shame on you, AA.",Detractor

" The website only permits one trip, but I wish to provide feedback for both inbound as well as outbound. The outbound was great, as I have come to expect with QR (who I have been flying with long haul premium for about 4 years). Nothing to be faulted. The 787 was a great business class, enhanced by the quality of the product and service. On the other hand, the 777 from Doha to JFK took the business class experience to a totally new level. The QSuites product, in my mind, is the best business class offering around, which compares favourably with the FC offering of some major airlines. Not to mention the numerous onboard staff and their fantastic service - in particular a young gent who led the onboard team from Doha to Jakarta on the return leg was outstanding! This is not to ignore the contributions of the other young gents and ladies who made both my trips a totally memorable experience. To summarise, QR business class was an outstanding product, mainly thanks to the commitment of their people. QR QSuites takes this to a totally new level! To get the perfect product, QR should either provide free internet for their premium customers (and reduce the pricepoint for the economy) or be more generous with the allowances, and reduce internet access prices.

" Brussels to Istanbul via Beirut. We have been failed by this horrible airline in so many ways. To start, we have booked our Christmas tickets on July 1st to secure a place for a fair price. The night before the flight. We go online to check in and discover that our connection flight from Istanbul to Beirut has been cancelled and we were automatically put on the previous connection flight that leaves before we arrive from Brussels. The system allowed the check-in and did not see anything wrong in the combination of flights. We call the customer service to make a change of flight three times and in all times the agent was unhelpful, unready for a conversation, and insisted that if we wanted to make it to Beirut, the only option would be leaving on the 23rd of December to arrive on the 24th, knowing that our initial booking was departure and arrival on December 21st. The only other option given was to fly on the 25th or get reimbursed with the ticket price paid in July to be able to buy a new ticket on another airline the day of the flight, which of course you understand how ridicule this is. So being scared to miss the opportunity to see my family this Christmas, we took the 23rd December option. After that, I researched more thoroughly the options and discovered that they were other options that made us get in time for our connection flight on the 21st, with available seats, that the agent had not only not offered, but also assured there were none. I confirmed with another Turkish airlines agent the availability of taking this flight I found, me, the client, who did what they were supposed to do if they were competent. However, now that I had agreed on the change of ticket for the 23rd, to be able to make my new change, policies applied all of the sudden, when they were completely at fault since the beginning. To make the change we had to pay a 100â‚¬ per person plus airport taxes plus the difference in price for the tickets which changed from 360â‚¬ per person to 680â‚¬ per person, which is completely scandalous since so far, all problems come from a failed system that never notified us about a change in flights, an agent who didn't do his job, and a customer service that is completely indifferent. To try to rectify the situation, I have stayed awake from the 20th night till 8am the next day, supposedly drafting a claim with the claim center without any proof of that, having the agent give me repetitively robotic textbook answers and telling me to wait. After staying awake, we never heard back from our urgent request. Missed our solution option with the plane leaving. I stayed on the phone trying to take the next available solution. Our file is ""still in process"" with no solution, missing all our option to get there before the 24th. This company behaves worse than a low-cost airline. Insults the customer and their intelligence. Hires people who neither have the proper English nor the empathy to deal with a client. Is frustrating and shameful. I am missing important family moments I have planned for months ahead because of this airline, its system, its employees. As for recommendations if you want to go to Beirut. Pegasus, a low cost, is much more efficient and respectful. Middle East airlines was definitely a good experience, I had a problem once with Aegean airlines, but they solved it on the spot not leaving for me room to complain.",Detractor

"  London to Melbourne via Singapore. In general, the boarding process and on-board service was very good, with most flight attendants being amiable and chatty. The food was good too, apart from a very ordinary entree leaving London. However, both flights were marred by very noisy children. On the first sector (on the very quiet A380) I was in the front cabin which offers a more intimate setting. A small baby cried almost all of the trip despite attempts by his parents to pacify him. So a decent sleep was impossible. Even the supplied noise-cancelling headsets could not eliminate all of the noise, and anyway they produced a constant repetitive buzzing noise. I fully support family travel and do feel for parents who have to deal with distressed children but surely SIA could arrange for a quiet area for travellers. The sector to Melbourne was worse. I was seated in the front row of the small front cabin - with 2 rows of seats and no bassinet places. Behind me was a family of 5 with a girly toddler who screamed for most of the flight. A baby crying I can understand, but this family was generally very noisy and seemed unaware that they were sharing the cabin with other passengers. There seemed to be no attempt by cabin staff to try to improve the situation, even though their exchanged looks indicated that they were aware of the noise. Added to that, the cabins of the un-upgraded B777-300ER's are becoming quite shabby and worn, and the IFE systems are behind the times. Because of the noisy fellow travellers I have to downgrade my ratings for these flights. It is a pity, because SIA are reliable, honour seat allocations and the staff are generally very good.

" I flew Air Canada from Heathrow to Toronto, arriving only to find that my suitcase did not arrive with me. When I lined up to report that it was missing, I found that other passengers had the same issues, with the same airline, and had come from various other destinations. One woman I spoke with had connected with my flight from Zurich, had sufficient layover / connection time, and yet her luggage also did not arrive. Passengers pay handsomely for flights. We comply with the airline stipulations regarding luggage. Is it so much to ask that our luggage actually gets on the same flight that we are on? In my case, when I was reporting it having not arrived (at @ 9:20 pm Oct 2nd in Toronto), I was told it was still at Heathrow. In this day and age of much improved technologies, systems, communications is it so much to ask for your luggage to be put on the same flight that you are taking so that you are not inconvenienced? It seems to me that Air Canada has increased its arbitrary decision making about whether or not to send luggage on the same flight as passengers. Is it any wonder that passengers are increasingly taking bags stuffed full, and often overstuffed, right onto the plane with them? This practice of not bothering to load luggage onto the same plane as the passenger is on is not acceptable. There is no excuse. Air Canada used to be a much more reliable airline than it is now.

Flew SYD-YVR business class on 777-200. The seat configuration is not great for couples my husband and I sat in the middle two seats and were divided by a partition and the angle of the seats meant that to speak to each other we both had to turn sideways and backwards. I could eyeball the person across the aisle more easily but the distance was such you couldn't have a quiet conversation thus still not satisfactory when traveling with someone. Not a lot of room to place personal items in easy reach during the flight. Service was excellent there was plenty of courteous and helpful staff. Food was nice 4 choices of main course I enjoyed my fish also the entree prawn salad. I have to agree with previous reviewer the head phones disposable foam ear pieces were very tricky to stretch over the phones easily torn and easily lost when taking the head phones off. Flat bed was good but I didn't sleep well sinuses didn't cope well with the aircon. Would use Air Canada again.,Passive
Flew with Qatar Airways from Singapore to Munich via Doha on QR945 and QR059. Boarding was on time and the cabin was very clean. Cabin crews were very friendly and warmly welcomed everyone who boarded. They gave plush toys to some kids who were onboard and smiled at them. Meal service was quick and on time. The food is very delicious. The inflight entertainment was also the one of the best I have used. Legroom was excellent. Qatar Airways will be my first choice if I have to travel to the Middle East or Europe.,Promoter
" The departure from Kuwait was delayed by 1 hour. Crew apologized for the delay but this reduced my time in exploring Al-Mourjan lounge in Doha. From Doha to Singapore neither the map or onboard camera were working on the A350. Crew on both sectors were fabulous, however, IFE and seat comfort (1x2x1 layout) is a joke. Wi-Fi was unavailable for my flight to Singapore. On the way back to Kuwait my seat IFE was malfunctioning so they changed my prefer preassigned seat to another seat, thus causing me inconvenience. Food and service was fabulous but I would not fly Qatar Airways again.",Detractor

He checked us in and also took our baggage, and said that the bag may or may not make it in the flight. He asked us to run, and we somehow made our way through security and with just 15 mins to departure, we ran towards the gate and the representative at the check in desk had informed everyone and people were waiting for us and we were able to board the flight and our luggage was also in the flight.

Sydney to London via Seoul is my first time I have flown Korean Air and an enjoyable experience. Sydney check in was efficient and I was able to send my bags right through to Paris. The layover in Incheon was exceptionally good with accommodation and meal vouchers provided by for stay at the Grand Hyatt Incheon. The next morning I found out that my Air France code share connection was delayed by 3 hours due to industrial problems at CDG. This was a disaster as it gave me a 30 minutes to get to my Eurostar connection to London. I approached Korean Air staff about flying Korean Air direct to London and they were exceptionally helpful. They managed to get me on a flight to London at no extra cost and managed to even help me retrieve my baggage from Air France. The meals and service on Korean Air were very good and there was no shortage of choice. Water was served through the flight. The entertainment system had the latest films but sadly there could have been a bit more variety. I look forward to flying back to Sydney with Korean.,Promoter
"Sitting in the so called ""First Class Lounge"" of China Eastern Airlines in Shanghai Pudong Airport waiting to board my domestic flight to Liuzhou? Checked in one and a half hours in advance and was directed to the lounge. Waiting to be called for boarding. All other flights are being called except mine. Finally 30 minutes after scheduled boarding time I get up and ask when boarding would start. I am being told matter-of-factly that the flight is delayed by three hours as if it was the most natural thing in the world. No apology or empathy. Lounge hostesses could not care less. Do not believe that it is their duty to inform guests of delays. Their job is only to inform of boarding times. China Eastern still don't understand customer service.",Detractor

YYZ-MCO-YYZ. Family of 5 travelling in economy. On time departures both ways. Flight crew was very friendly and attentive (also much younger than the average AC flight crew which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Aircraft was an A319 in rouge livery. Pretty basic but clean and nice. The only catch is the IFE is Wifi-based so you have to have an IPhone or IPad with the AC app or you need to rent one in flight for $10. Fortunately they told us this before we departed so we were able to download the app.,Promoter

Bought first class ticket for my son from Miami to Portland, because it was a red eye and want him to have no issues.

" Venice to Zurich in business class. Brand new aircraft (CS1), super clean with good toilet amenities for a one-hour flight. Cabin crew quite nice and friendly. Business class seat layout is a joke though as there is no separator at all between business and economy, not even a basic curtain. What is more, seat layout is 3-3 with the middle seat blocked. Legroom is good. Food was very basic and very limited in quantity. Champagne available but overall the selection of beverages is too limited. Not worth the money. Next time I will stick to economy.",Passive
"I am very upset with Spirit Airlines. My mother and I booked a non-stop flight from Detroit to Denver that was supposed to depart at 7am this morning. As we pulled up to the airport we received a call saying that our flight had been canceled. We went inside the airport to figure out what was going on and had to wait in an hour and a half line before we could speak to anyone. They informed us that the pilot was over hours so the flight had to be canceled. Isn't that something that should have been known way before 2 hours until our flight was supposed to depart? To make up for the inconvenience they gave us tickets for another airlines at 1.50, with a 3 hour layover in Chicago and then arrive at Denver at 7pm. I will be spending over 10 hours sitting in the airport today. The Spirit manager was not any help and only gave us a $14 meal comp to make up for the inconvenience. Spirit has nice prices but if this is what their services is like it's not worth it.",Detractor
We travelled on Business Class from Singapore to Colombo. Tickets were booked on expedia. There were some confusion over the name on the boarding pass and passport. Staff at check-in assured us that it had been changed after an argument but found out that it had not. Departure from Singapore was delayed an hour. Now departure from Colombo has also been delayed for an hour. Staff at check-in should be less surly. The airline should maintain a level of punctuality.,Detractor
"  Munich to Barcelona. Vueling is one of the worst airlines I've encountered, and I travel very regularly. They locked the access to my account and never unlocked it â€œafter 30 minutesâ€ and the only way to access it was to actually call their customer service, which you pay for. Their â€œmilesâ€ offer is buggy, you can't actually apply a flight to your account for X different reasons so they avoid giving you miles. I had to give up each time, and I flew multiple times with them. I think this bad ergonomy it's totally voluntary. Then I had another flight where their site blew in the middle of the actual credit card transaction. Impossible to recover my reservation, I had to call again, pay for it, and they dared to tell me to go to the airport to pay again there with the same reservation rather than solving the problem. I'll now avoid this company at any price.",Detractor
My wife and I travelled with our daughter and her 20 month old baby to London. We travelled in First Class. We did the same trip last year but without our daughter and her son. Naturally we were a little bit nervous about travelling with the baby but the staff were so accommodating helpful and friendly that we had nothing to worry about. The staff on both legs were superb in every respect. The food was excellent and the First class sleeping pods were excellent in every respect. Comfortable clean and well appointed. We will travel with British Airways every time we could not fault them in any way. Just one minor thing that is no fault of British Airways. When they call the flight there is a dedicated boarding row for First Class passengers but it seemed that everyone was able to use this lane which means that we had to join the queue rather than just walk straight through. I know that this sounds rather pathetic but surely if one is prepared to pay the additional fare one should be entitled to some form of privileges. We have travelled with British Airways on many occasions and each time we have had the same wonderful experiences.,Promoter
" Guangzhou to Sydney, my first time to depart from Guangzhou Airport T2. This new terminal is full of advanced facilities and is more reasonable and convenient than T1. There are a lot of free luggage trolleys and baby strollers before and after security check. The China Southern Lounge is very large and has many functional zones, my two baby boys really love its kids room. After boarding, the flight attendants reorganize seats for us, so that my eight-month-old baby could have a flat bed to sleep as well. The business class dining was amazing. I booked one kid meal in advance. After landing, the baggage claim was very efficient. It was a perfect long-haul flight.",Promoter
"Air Canada rouge was a disgrace at least on this flight. The aircraft interior was dirty, seats shabby and the state of the toilet was atrocious. The aircraft had been at the gate for long enough to be properly cleaned, so there was no excuse for the lack of cleanliness. Flight attendants completely indifferent throughout the flight. Clearly they were intent on doing the bare minimum. Surely and unsmiling. Very poor standard of grooming, some looked like they had slept in their uniforms. There is no in seat entertainment system.

CX918 B77W MNL-HKG. I am not a regular user of CX but past recent experiences in their new Business Class have been good. The seat is excellent and the catering satisfactory. On this flight I was told that I was being upgraded to First Class but was then advised that there would be no First Class service just the seat and that the catering would be Business Class standard. Having selected a Business Class window seat as always in the CX type of lay-out I was allocated seat 1D in First Class. This is a single centre seat in CX's apparently new First Class lay-out and can only be described as a cell. Its certainly spacious as you would expect in First Class nowadays but there is a feeling of being locked in to a high sided enclosure. The seat itself is like a bench its width would adequately seat two people and has no shape to it. Also there are no overhead bins only a small cupboard that forms part of the cell which is only large enough to take a small bag and a jacket. Roller bags have to be placed on the floor protruding out from underneath the foot-stool that forms part of the flat bed. It was sufficiently depressing that I asked for my Business Class seat back but the flight was full hence the â€œupgradeâ€ and my seat had been allocated to someone else. The Business Class catering dinner on this flight â€“ comprised an adequate fruit salad a main course where a choice of two meat in a sauce and rice and fish in a sauce and rice were offered up on a tray by the cabin attendant. They looked so unappetizing that I passed on the main course. Dessert was a dry looking piece of cake which I passed on as well. This was low standard Business Class catering at its worst there was no menu given so the actual content of the meal was down to guess-work. Finally we were told whilst in the Lounge that there were problems with the IFE on board. We then departed almost 2 hours late. Overall very disappointing and in comparable with other carriers in the Region.,Detractor
"Spirit fare is cheaper than most airlines, but are the worse in customer services. It is better to pay a little more at different airline and have better service.

We had to book a different flight and lost 1 day and 1 night worth for hotel and car rental. Spirit does nothing to accommodate that. A little delay is fine and no airline is perfect.",Detractor
"Toronto to Prague with Air Canada rouge. First of all let me say for some reason I expected a lot from my first flight on Air Canada rouge going from Toronto to Prague. That said however given the state of the airline industry today perhaps I was just having a senior moment. When we boarded the plane we found out that unless we downloaded the Air Canada App we would not be able to use the Air Canada Rouge entertainment system once airborne. It would have been nice to have been informed during the 3 hour layover in Toronto rather than being told on the plane as the doors were closing. My partner's Apple operating system had not been upgraded to the current version and because of that the app would not load on her iPad. We did load it on my and her iPhone which means we were relegated to watching movies on our phone screens. Of course we could have rented an iPad for $10 from the flight attendants. When the Air Canada App is accessed you are subjected to 8 â€“ 10 commercials before your movie or TV choice is viewed. And don't make an error and try to see some other choice because you will have to go through all the ads again. The choice of available films was very dated and limited and although films like X-Men and Hunger games would certainly appeal to many they are not my cup of tea so I decided to listen to the classical music selections. Again here the choices were again very meager and while listening to Chopin the app would not stay open and would shut down every few minutes, which was very annoying. I finally gave up on it and shut the phone down totally. It was at this point that the flight attendants started the meal service. The choices for the entrees were pasta or chicken. I elected for the pasta and my partner selected the chicken. I will admit that being second generation Italian has spoiled me for my taste in pasta however I am fond of dishes such as macaroni and cheese and baked pasta when it is prepared well, so I would not classify myself as a foodie snob. There was nothing about either meal that we were served except the chocolate cake that could ever be classified as done well. The food was absolutely vile. I would very strongly suggest that Air Canada find another caterer. We both found our meal inedible and only ate a couple of bites. Fortunately we had brought some cheese and carrots from home and we ate those along with the not very good wine that was sold. Now getting back to Air Canada's Wi-Fi. It can only be used to access the entertainment system, which means that you have to spend 7 or 8 hours in a plane with no Internet access. That is bad enough for the casual traveler however the business customer is put at a distinct disadvantage when he/she cannot utilize the time to accomplish work online. Given the choice I can honestly say that I will never fly Air Canada rouge again.",Detractor

At one point, I could hear two of the flight attendants talking to each other and laughing at me for going to the restroom multiple times. If I could hear it while in the bathroom, I'm sure that other people could hear which was really embarrassing for me. The flight from Jamaica had one delay after another. In all the flight was delayed by 4 hours, which resulted in most of the passengers, including myself, missing our connecting flights back home. Spirit set up accommodations for us at very low quality motels (the window in room did not completely close and my shower didn't work, but that's beside the point), and we were given food vouchers that the motel did not honor. The shuttle didn't start running until 6am, but my flight back home required me to get to leave the motel at 5am, so I had to spend $30 on a taxi. Since I couldn't use my food vouchers, I had to spend my own money for food at the airport, $11. Since I arrived home a day late due to Spirit's delays, the person who was supposed to pick me up from the airport was no longer able to so I had to spend another $30 to pay for a ride home.

All that was in bag I had purchased online was a chocolate bar, a tiny bottle of water and a sorry excuse for a sandwich with one mouthful in it! The arrival into Lisbon was punctual but a very long bus ride took place from the arrival point to a terminal and then followed a very long wait for the luggage too!

" Deceptive and misrepresenting their low fares. Last minute cancellation of my original carrier, Delta, made it necessary to make an alternative flight plan. Southwest ticketing agent informed me that the flight was sold out of lower fares and only the higher fares were available. The 1 way ticket price from Indianapolis to Orlando was $414.98. Traveling with my son required 2 tickets, $829.96. Boarding the plane it was empty, hence we were lied to reqarding the availability of lower fares. We were simply gouged with the higher fare because of urgent circumstances. Called the corporate headquarters of Southwest and they gave me the story that low fares are not available for disparate last minute travelers. The attendant on the flight stated that lower fares were available for this flight as it is low demand flight.

I used a connecting flight to Bulawayo which was with South African Airlink and even though it was only a 1 hour flight, the food was much better and the plane far more comfortable. A very poor experience with British Airways and GBP 4000 spent for the 3 of us to get there and back. I will never be disapointed with Ryanair or easyjet again. British Airways are trading on their name only.",Detractor
A319 YYC to LAS return - the most uncomfortable aircraft I have ever flown in. With my seat back upright and the person in front of me reclined it 13 inches from his seatback to my nose - you don't have to think too hard to guess what the leg room was like. It amazes me to what lengths these airlines go in cramming seats into claustrophobia situations and people just take it.,Detractor
Flew Melbourne-Seoul-Vancouver-San Francisco-Seoul-Melbourne. Aircraft clean and comfortable toilets clean. Flew Prestige Class and the service was friendly efficient and food lovely. Purser welcomed you aboard and thanked you for flying at arrival to destination. Overnight in Seoul on return journey due to 24 hour layover at the Hyatt Regency. Have now flown them twice on long haul trips and would not hesitate to fly them again fares very competitive and no problems with check-in at any of the airports flights meals luggage seats etc. Fresh baked cookies for snacks. If I had any quibble it would be with their minute wine glasses. No problems getting them refilled but would appreciate a larger glass to start with and it wouldn't be quite so embarrassing having to ask for said refill.,Promoter
"Was scheduled on 7/16/2016 for 9am from Atlantic City to Ft. Lauderdale. Flight was confirmed on check-in and then was delayed numerous times and did not depart Atlantic City until 5pm causing our party to miss a cruise departure. Airline offered no apology and offered $50 towards next flight that had to be used within 3 months. On return trip on 7/24/2016 aircraft was downgraded (reduced in size) so a number of people with high sequence numbers were bumped including a family who had a severely ill child who had to be back in NJ for treatment. The airline offered them nothing. Gate personnel were extremely rude as were flight personnel and threats of physical removal by uniformed officers. There was no diplomacy from airline personnel. I will never use Spirit again and will go out of my way to tell others of their lack of diplomacy, attitude and compassion",Detractor
"  Trip to Stockholm from Brussels. 1h30 delay for a 1h50 flight. Got served a hot tea with some residues inside, because the teabag was broken. I did not mind about that, at that point I was thinking of the bus connection I lost in Stockholm because of the delay. Stewardess was expressionless, I tried to take a smile out of her but to no avail. They did not even serve free peanuts. So what is the point of the airline really? Does it try to become Ryanair? There's nothing wrong with that, but if that is the case, why aren't the tickets appropriately priced? On a positive note, the airplane was clean and the seats were nice with a lot of legroom.",Detractor

NZ80 HKG to AKL. 22nd June 2014. Business Class. B777-200ER. The aircraft was old and shabby. The herringbone seat configuration facing away from the window is like a coffin. The seat is narrow and has limited recline when seated normally as the lay flat bed requires the seat back to be folded fully forward. The bed is reasonably comfortable with the mattress pad. The welcome aboard drink was Sparking Wine not Champagne and served by one of the 3 Grumpy Old Men who were attending the forward cabin. Food was just edible and the choices very poor. No wines listed and when asked was told Pinot Noir or Cab Sav. No hangars suitable to hang trousers for those who change into travelling clothes. The AV is something out of the ark. A screen that has a resolution such that everything looks as if the lens is smeared with Vaseline. A controller whereby when pressed takes a few seconds to respond and sound and screen hesitation on both movie and audio channels (seat 3A if anyone from AirNZ read these posts). Breakfast coffee was vile but the hot bacon roll was a pleasant change. I hope the B777-300 is a step up as I have a west coast return trip soon. If not I shall stick to SQ and EK for all my long haul trips. There are better alternatives and the penny pinching shows maybe this route doesn't justify anything better but even CX with the dated A340 aircraft on this route is a much better experience.,Detractor
My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong â€˜end'. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other â€˜end'. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,Detractor

"  This was my first and last time flying with Wizz Air. The airport staff were strange and not at all friendly. We paid the most expensive check in fee I have ever seen. The ticket price seem cheap but it is not. We stood in the same check in line as people with flights leaving 3 hours later while our flight was leaving in 30min. The screens above the check in counter is often used to inform passengers what line to stand in, but not here. The small and outdated airport in NykÃ¶ping Sweden is not a nice place to be. This trip was in the end much more expensive than a regular ticket from an airline with good service. Never again.",Detractor

Luton to Budapest. On the way out all was fine apart from the smallest legroom I have ever encountered on a plane. However on the return leg things were different. All seemed to be going very well they started checking us in an hour before the departure time and we went down to the busses for boarding (or so we thought). However we were crammed into the bendy bus. We were crammed in like sardines with small children and parents all mixed in. It was dark and cold outside and they kept us cooped up in there for over 30 mins. Away we went without a hint of explanation let alone an apology. I can only assume the way Wizzair have got round their debacle with the airport is to use their busses as waiting areas prior to boarding. It was a shame really because the other parts of the flight were perfectly acceptable and the cabin crew fine.,Passive

"Flew Cathay Pacific from Melbourne to Amsterdam via Hong Kong. Great airline, very friendly staff. Meals were nice but would be nice to pre-order like other arlines offer. The only area for improvement is the lack of visibility or attention once the meal service is over. No water, juice or any snacks were available or offered. It would be nice to see the attendants during the flight. I found the seat to be quite comfortable as it reclines into many positions. It's a shame you can't tilt the screen to be able to view when fully flat. I would definitely fly them again.",Promoter

"Los Angeles to Singapore via Tokyo Narita, and as my first time flying with ANA I am quite impressed. A Boeing 777-300ER and the seats are in 3x3x3 layout in economy to Tokyo and surprisingly enough 2x4x3 in the flight from Tokyo to Singapore. Seat pitch is good and better than Singapore Airlines or United, but the width is a tad small. Reclining is acceptable too. Headrest, footrest are standard. Crew is very courteous and I had no issues communicating in English. Flight was delayed at LAX by 1 hour but managed to land on time in Tokyo and Singapore. Food is served hot and the service is pretty fast and meet my needs. As a vegetarian, I requested AVML and was surprised with the quality of food. Full marks here. Entertainment is mostly Hollywood + Japanese and perhaps this is an area they can improve in these days. The movies are not bad either - a dozen plus english movies, couple of Chinese, Indian, French and loads of japanese movies. Overall happy with the journey and I am flying with them next month. Excellent service, quick and attentive crew, on time, great food, In seat power and USB, Excellent/Clean toilets. No ear blasting announcements.

"Overall pretty good experience on flights HEL-YYZ-HEL. Outbound flight left slightly late but arrived 15 min early but return flight left an hour late due to overbooking and missing passengers as we were told. Due to overbooking of economy class, business class was full on return flight. It seems to me that upgrades were not given to Finnair plus tier or oneworld tier members but on a random basis. There should be a system that honors frequens fliers over the others. I know this is one thing that irritates most for higher Finnair plus tier members, and Finnair is losing these customers. Seats are full-flat but slightly narrow for sleeping. Nice pillow and good duvet and both were clean on both flights. Service was good, as it should be in business class. On return flight service was even better due to purser's efforts to deliver more personal service. Extra credit for that. Food was better for outbound flight. The main course was pretty good for airline meals. The dessert selection is Finnair's weak point for sure. There's an ice cream which are tiny prepacked cups of HÃ¤agen-Dazs or Macarons for example. Entertainment system has been upgraded and selection is better but still lacking behind of many airlines.

 Dallas Ft Worth to Washington. Worst experience ever. I am never flying American airlines ever again. I got 40 minutes before the flight and was told that I was late to board and was even dropped off. I was treated like I had never been in a flight ever in my life. And I even had my boarding pass with me. And when I said I didn't want my baggage if I was late for the baggage checkin the lady in the counter said the plane is ready to leave. The flight was for 7:10 and I was there at 6:30. She said the only way I could fly the same day was if I was on a standby and paid the fair difference and all other extra charges that would make up to $470 or more.

The flight attendant said that she couldn't provide the meal to my son as ""we hadn't paid for the full seat"". My wife could have paid for the meal then and there but the staff said that they had not paid for a full seat, is unacceptable. We had paid the asking price set for â€œunder 2 year oldâ€ traveler.

I phoned Lufthansa reservations and they told me that I was right and that I absolutely did not require a visa for a 1 hour transit and I should try to check in online instead, which I did sucessfully. However, the Swissport staff at the airport still refused to give me a boarding pass and allow me to board the flight. They claimed to have phoned German immigration in Algeria but refused to give the name of the person they had spoken to. Their refusal to check me in led me to miss my flight. They refused to provide anything in writing despite me asking several times. I wasted an enormous amount of time and money getting to Marrakech airport, paying for a hotel there, car rental and reserving accomodation in Istanbul. Lufthansa took my money and then refused to allow me to travel. It appears that buying a Lufthansa ticket is like a lottery ticket - maybe you will get to fly somewhere but maybe you will just be told ""no"" and then the ticket that you paid lots of money for becomes worthless.

All flights were delayed and the return connecting flight from Madrid to New York was delayed 3 hours but we were not informed until we actually got to the airport shortly before scheduled take off. They did give us a free sandwich from a local sandwich shop in airport which was good. The worst part of the travel was both flights had limited air-conditioning and I felt like I was in a sweatbox for seven hours, it was awful. The staff rarely came around and offered a drink even though that cabin was so hot.

Tried to use their streaming app, it worked fine, however you need to have your earphones with you (for music and films). Only negative was that in Bucharest a lot of people boarded as gold/family/disabled, when clearly they were not entitled, making it unfair for the rest of the passengers (for example a lady with a 14 year old daughter, or a group of adult youngsters).",Promoter
" For this transcontinental flight from Seattle to New York, we decided to try Delta and booked its Delta Comfort+ Seat. When we arrived at the airport, it was an absolute mess with little staff and loads of people trying to check in and get through security. It was unclear what we were supposed to do and we waited for a long time before realising that we were supposed to use the e-kiosk for check in. Boarding was also an absolute mess with no clear line or anything. It took ages to board as people were blocking the aisles. After we settled in, it was a pretty comfortable ride to New York and we arrived early. The IFE has really a lot of content and was more than enough for the journey. The rest of the journey was smooth, except that we had to walk 15 minutes to collect our bags.",Passive
SVO-HKG (return) in April 2011. I decided to take this trip because Aeroflot recently replaced old fleet on this route with new Airbus A330 and because ticket was quite cheap. The plane is really good food and service are good too. On both legs boarding was efficient and flights arrived on time. The drawback is departing from old terminal F while most Aeroflot flights depart from new terminal D. Check-in and security are much easier in D.,Promoter

I flew on an Austrian Airlines ticket with the flight operated by Tyrolean. I wasn't happy with the service on check-in by Austrian Air. I was assigned a back seat despite the entire business class being empty. All seats except the first row had very little leg room corresponding to the smallest I have seen in economy. It seemed like the check-in staff did not care much about customer service. Change fee is quite high -100 euros despite business class cabin being completely empty. Once onboard the service was very friendly and the food excellent.,Passive
Sad to say BA missed a big opportunity when their new 787 and A380 entered service. Same old sub standard business class seating as on the retired 747s. Compared to many airlines the BA premium service is poor and I don't know how they keep a 4 star rating. The cabin crew were excellent though I will concede. Food was very poor with my steak ruined because it was swimming in grease (laughingly referred to as jus) which mixed with the hollandaise sauce to make a disgusting mess. The 787 was good and BA have improved their IFE system but screens are small and have to be stowed for take off and landing unlike those in economy and premium. Pay more get less.,Detractor

Hidden fees all over terrible customer service rude staff in every department! Every bag you have is extra money checked bags carry on bags and they tell you none of this until after you have bought your ticket. It even costs money to print your boarding pass at the airport. Your carry on can weigh 50 lbs which costs you different amounts based on when and where you tell them you have a carry on. Then if you check a bag it costs you another 50 bucks if it weighs over 40lbs! I have flown plenty this is by far the worst experience I have had with an airline.,Detractor

"  Edinburgh to Faro. Checked in online, so upon arrival at the airport proceeded straight to the gate to find that just under half the flight had also purchased priority boarding so that pretty much defeats the point of the perk! We were then made to queue outside for 20 minutes until the aircraft was ready - bearing in mind it's January and we're in Scotland, it was freezing. Once I boarded the aircraft one of the flight attendants commented on how cold my hands were which was bizarre as the only reason I was that cold was due to the airline that they were representing. The flight also almost ran out of food and they flight attendants couldn't of cared less, it felt like they just wanted to finish their shift and get home. We missed our departure slot at Edinburgh which was slightly frustrating as we were standing in the cold outside the aircraft for so long - but the informative Captain got us there only 5 minutes later than scheduled! It made me laugh however when they thanked us for choosing Ryanair because in actual fact, we did not have a choice for our dates of travel. Overall I just did not feel as well looked after as I continually do on their rivals easyJet.",Detractor
I think this airline pretends to be cheaper but it is actually not. They charge you for your luggage (even for the carry-on) some of the seats cannot even be reclined and they charge you for the cheapest snacks and drinks.

" Melbourne to Delhi. An excellent flight, left on time, arrived Delhi 50 minutes early. The flight was about 80% full and other than a few very minor things I could not fault Air India. The food provided was excellent (breakfast of egg omelette with sausages, croissant, butter, jam, coffee/tee), lunch consisted of three choices (lamb, chicken, vegetarian). The chicken came with rice and vegetables with a separate side salad and desert, all of which was tasty and of good quality. On top of this there were two drink-runs and before landing they provided another sandwich. The seat was good (admittedly I forked out for an exit row which I then was happily able to have the whole row to myself), legroom good enough for a giraffe. The only very minor minus points were the not-working global map and a rather limited selection of new films. The crew was responsive and courteous and happy to assist.

" Indianapolis to Las Vegas. Horror show: worst flight in 60 years of flying. Plane from Las Vegas arrived in time around 7pm for our return in it to Las Vegas, supposedly continuing to my destination that night arriving at 1am the next day. But there was a problem with some landing gear. We waited for repairs until 1 am, when we were told that the plane would not be fixed, and hotels for overnighting were being searched for. At 4:30 am we were told that they had been found, but out in suburbs, and we would have to find and pay for our own transportation to get there. A special flight was being added the next day for us at 1pm. A high stack of thin foam mattress pads was wheeled out for us to sleep on the floor. I chose that option with a bunch of other intrepid souls, not liking the transportation options and the few hours for sleep allowed in the distant hotel offering.... I wondered at the time that a company would happen to have a supply of mattresses on hand like that. The next day, I got on that 1pm flight to Las Vegas, then caught a quick standby flight to Portland--but my luggage did not make it. Spirit's baggage handling was not available by phone, and I had reservations to continue by vacation hundreds of miles away the next day by car. By wandering around in the airport, the next morning, I spotted my small red suitcase behind a glass fronted storage cabinet... by asking a Security Guard, I got some advice about getting help from an Arrivals desk near the vacant Spirit desk, who had a key to it! On my return home, on an overnight flight sitting upright in a chair, which I have never tried to sleep in before, I did not get any sleep. The cost-cutting non-reclining seats were an inspiration from hell, and the desk-bound decision maker's purchase of bungee straps to hold safety cards and not a pouch to store waterbottles in so they did not roll dangerously about on the floor should be used to replace chairs for these idiots to sit on!",Detractor
"  Flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu on a family vacation. Boarding was surprisingly quick for such a large plane. The staff that greeted us were very polite and pointed us towards our seats. The plane did not have any monitors but was fittied with wifi. Only issue with the wifi is that it doesn't work over the pacific so doesn't matter. This isn't United's fault but with the wifi provider. There was no food offered on this flight but got the stroopwafel and drinks. I love the waffel so I didn't complain and asked for one more. We were also given a blanket which was nice because the plane did get a bit chilly as our flight was early morning. Once, we took off the flight was bump free and smooth as it got. I have been on many flights and have done this flight numerous times with many airlines. This flight had to be the smoothest I have been on. Overall the only thing I wish they had was actual food on the flight and working wifi but the latter cant be blamed on United.

I am a frequent flyer (although not with Frontier, to be fair) and hence well familiar with booking flights online, but this fee did not even cross my radar during the booking. Or if it did, I must have thought it so ludicrous that it was referring to something else. These extra airline charges are getting to be absolutely absurd. Who flies with only a purse?

"  I had travelled on the early morning flight from Mumbai to London on this Air India flight and was pleasantly happy with the experience on this flight. The flight departed on time and the load on this sector was quite a bit. After takeoff, the breakfast service commenced and as I had opted for the vegetarian option, a veg cutlet, stuffed parathas and bhurji was provided along with a croissant, fruits and tea. The breakfast was very tasty and sumptuous. The inflight entertainment was ample for this 9 hour journey and had sufficient programs to keep one occupied. I also managed to get a few hours of sleep aswell in economy class. The seats are comfortable enough and there is ample legroom. Quite possibly the best legroom for intercontinental flights in economy. The crew were very polite and carried out their tasks with utmost professionalism and provided regular drinks of water/juice to the passengers. Before landing the crew distributed immigration cards and also lunch was served. Once again opted for the veg course which consisted of mixed vegetables with rice and rajma followed by dessert and tea.

That could be excused if the seat made up for it but it is impossible to get comfortable in any position as it feels like being on a hard lumpy narrow bench. I used 2 blankets to try and soften the seat / angled bed but forget sleeping. The cabin was too warm which only added to the discomfort.

"  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time.

LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given.

Their SLC growth (# of flights to and from there) has not affected their great customer service negatively as far as I could tell. One thing which was different on the return flight though was that the flight attendant came around prior to our landing and thanked each customer for flying with Alaska and I felt she meant it. It was a small but very classy thing to do as I have never seen this before. It is the small but kind gestures that help make a difference when I fly. Keep it up Alaska!,Promoter
" After extensive delays with no communication from ground staff, we boarded our Bangkok to Singapore flight. There were about 60 of us total on an Airbus 350 that held five times that many people, so everyone had plenty of room to spread out. The 350 is a great aircraft, and it took me less than 5 minutes on board to figure out that I wanted my next trans pacific flight on one of these-they're quiet, spacious, and high tech. From the reclining seats that slide forward to make life easier on those behind you to the headrests which seemingly defy the laws of physics (they fold in-and out) the attention to detail is superb. The tray tables have a tablet stand, and the personal space in general had more functions than I could figure out. Cathay service onboard really doesn't need another glowing review-it was superb as expected. Meals were excellent and served promptly, trays were also collected promptly as well after the meal. The inflight entertainment is really top notch, though the screen is a bit jumpy as you scroll through. For those of us with terrible hearing, the volume is adequate without being turned up too high-it helps that the plane is very quiet at cruise altitude.

I thought this would improve in premium economy class but I believe the options were identical. Additionally the viewing choices were very limited in terms of movies and were the same coming back. On my return premium flight there were two toilets at the front of the plane in my cabin, for some reason the staff sequestered one of the toilets for their own use and even then still sometimes used the only other available toilet, is this normal?

I liked the repeated options to grab another croissant / roll or requests whether I wanted a refill of wine or coffee. The Airbus A330s I flew were new and immaculate. My only complaint was the boarding process which wasn't well organized in Munich at all with a long narrow gate where everyone across all classes congregated and blocked any chance for an organized boarding. Had I not been near the front I would have been one of the last to board despite my business class seat and never heard a call for that class to board. The return trip was a bit better with the gate agent asking out loud - not over the PA - whether anyone was in business class and directed us to a separate line that was initially hidden from view.

Arrive for our connection in Frankfurt to find they changed our children from 3 seats together to 3 random middle seats. No explanation or solution. Just a shrug. Wi-Fi doesn't work, no entertainment on FRA-TLV flight. Business class on our connecting European flight is literally three coach seats with the middle seat blocked off.

" Tampa to Denver. Yes they have low prices but you seriously get what you pay for, the lowest of the low. Definitely the worst seats I've ever sat on. The trays are less than half the standard size barely enough room for you to put your head on, and no cup holder spot. Everything costs money, from bags to every little thing besides a cup of water they offer on the last half of the flight.

"Bangkok Airways from Lampang to Bangkok in March 2016 on an ATR72 propeller. No queue at check-in with polite staff who promptly printed out tags. Generous luggage allowance of 20 kg provided as the ticket continued with one of their partners, Jet Airways, out of Thailand. Ticket very cheap, this domestic leg was valued about 45 USD. Bangkok Airways provides an open free lounge in the terminal with breakfast items. Inspiring, clean, and well serviced. Lot of staff to assist with food, garbage, WiFi, or whatever. Airport charming: left the gate to proceed in open, overshaded, electric trolley trains with space for 10-15 passengers at the time â€“ just to drive us the 200 meter to the aircraft avoiding the sun. Onboard, clear announcements, professional, well-dressed and communicative staff who managed to provide a full meal service (pizza, fruits, drinks, coffee/tea) on this 90 minutes flight in a very small aircraft which was very clean despite a bit worn. Metal cutlery provided, refills as you wanted. Flexible seating. Before landing we were informed at which baggage belt our bags would arrive. This is a rare and useful detail. Bus waiting in BKK, and it took only 10 Minutes from entering the bus to embark into the BKK Terminal. Bangkok Airways staff were again available around the belt to ensure further guidance if needed. Well managed airline with beautiful signage, logos, and interesting marketing. The airlines appears faster than bigger airlines in looking up new routes where business opportunities are seen (eg. from DAD-BKK from May 2016).

"  I was traveling on Vacation from JFK to LIN, and this was my very first time using Aer Lingus. I don't plan to ever fly with Aer Lingus again. Some things are understandable and are outside of an airline's control. Many of the issues I had experienced were purely poor customer service. Upon arrival at JFK airport, I was immediately turned off at the fact that Aer Lingus is not part of TSA-Pre, meaning I had to go through the standard security check which takes a very long time. So I finally make it to my gate, and I am waiting to start boarding the aircraft. Our flight was supposed to depart at 17:30. 17:30 rolls around and I had to go up and ask the attendant at the gate to find out the plane wasn't cleared to land and had to continue flying past JFK to Boston? I've never heard of this happening before, but I wasn't too irritated as my connecting flight didn't depart until 0700 Ireland time. Well, the flight delay went on for over two hours, and I ended up missing my connecting flight. The delay was understandable, and I assume not the fault of the airline, but communication in regards to the delay was nonexistent. Here is where the real frustration and poor customer service begins. A chaotic, disorganized line forms at the customer service counter to arrange for new connecting flights. This line is so poorly organized that many people were waiting in the wrong line for a half hour, and the flight attendants were the ones who directed them to those lines! Exhausted after an over two-hour delay as well as a 5-hour flight, I wait in this line for 4 hours. This is not an exaggeration but timed. Finally, we get to the front of the line and are told we can't fly out until tomorrow, causing us to lose a full day of our vacation. Aer Lingus in no way compensated us for this inconvenience, or loss of a vacation day, or even offered us one of those $5 drink vouchers, nothing. They sent everyone to the same hotel that couldn't fly out overnight, which was then overbooked and many had to leave that hotel to find accommodations for the evening. This isn't the end of my poor customer service experience. Arriving at the airport for the flight back, with two hours leeway till our flight leaves, we get into a line that wraps around the check-in counter and stretches all the way down through part of the hallway. Aer Lingus had 1 check in counter. There were three desks and only one attendant. I got to my gate right before they shut the doors. I could not imagine what I would have done if I missed that flight and was stranded in another country. Last but not least, the chance to leave feedback to Aer Lingus ended the day I landed back in JFK. I guess they expect me to rate my experience while I'm flying with them. All in all, pick any other than Aer Lingus, and I pray no one else has to go through what I had to go through and have travel completely ruin their vacation.",Detractor

The FRA-DEL leg was delayed 24 hours due to the heavy fog in Delhi (not Air India's fault) but they quickly and painlessly transferred us to a Airport Hotel where we had to spend the night. Air India even arranged for Indian food at the Hotel. Flight took off on time the next day at around 4pm and the Dreamliner was as usual excellent. Great leg room good food (though the portions were tiny the Steward quickly fixed that on request by providing me with an extra tray) staff attentive throughout. What surprised me was the attentiveness of the Stewards towards parents with young kids. Came to check up on the parents multiple times and kept the kids happy with candy and cola. The DEL-HYD leg was pleasant and on time. The return journey HYD-DEL-FRA was uneventful and on time. As a regular traveler on this route I can only recommend Air India for their great service. Contrary to what people say about the airline it has transformed from a hopelessly terrible service to a rather decent airline.,Promoter

" Ljubljana to Vienna. Overall, the flight services of Adria are those of an average, reliable, small European carrier. I have flown them many times over the years, and I have seldom experienced any problems with the flights themselves. Returning to Vienna from a visit to Albania and Slovenia in September, however, I had an encounter with Adria that has revealed just how much their customer service quality could be improved. Adria offers opportunities to purchase business class upgrades or empty economy class seats through Optiontown. Business class upgrades on Adria are a joke because you're paying at least 50EUR for an empty seat next to you and a snack. The option to purchase an empty economy class seat at 19EUR is a great deal though, in my opinion. Having selected this option for my LJU-VIE flight, I received a confirmation that my transaction had cleared and the extra seat had been assigned next to me. Fast forward to the actual flight: there had been an aircraft change from the CRJ-900 to an ATR-72 (Darwin Airlines/Etihad Regional), but I still had my empty seat. The ATR-72 has two seats that face towards the rear of the plane at the front of the cabin, and one of the women seated there was scared to fly backwards, so the flight attendant unilaterally reassigned her to my empty seat without asking. It's a short flight, and I didn't want to cause a scene, so I just let it all happen assuming I could easily get a refund for my 20EUR transaction. It took exactly one month for Adria's customer service team to respond to me, and they said that my ""business class upgrade"" had not cleared, so I was not charged. I had never requested a business class upgrade, and I was charged for the empty seat I had in fact requested, so I sent all of the relevant receipts and statements back to Adria. Three weeks later, I still have yet to receive a response, so I simply disputed the charge with my credit card company that was easily able to understand the issue and refunded the money. 3-4 weeks+ response time from customer service is absolutely embarrassing, and Adria should be ashamed of their operations. It's sad for an otherwise perfectly acceptable airline to lose a customer over 20EUR.",Detractor

I traveled reluctantly on American Airlines Buenos Aires - New York and return in early December 2014. On the most recent trip I can only say that the seating was horrible the flight attendants inattentive. I did like two attendants on the return flight one a male who saw the girl sitting next to me unwilling to put her tray up for takeoff and he firmly said 'you know the drill put the tray up'. You could sense his professionalism and no nonsense approach. He was quite professional. Another attendant was very personal with me and admitted that flying was not what it used to be said that the 777-300 had two back seats that you could not recline and actually defended the passenger in terms of lack of comfort. She said that now it is a question of bringing your own entertainment food all of which surprised me since she was not party line and quite personable apologizing for making me wait ten minutes for some water saying 'I'm sorry I'm in another world today' not so reassuring but she was on top of things. A mixed bag. On the flight to New York the food was awful but a flight attendant when telling her that I need a lot of water subtly gave me an entire bottle in a plastic bag. Perhaps it's because I helped an older passenger with her luggage but still what a shocker. I find that I am very uncomfortable getting off their planes. They have twice lost my luggage once on an earlier flight but found it days later. The latest was really just uncomfortable because of the 2x5x2 seating arrangement on a 777-200. I cannot recommend them for comments like 'whose the next victim?' or 'the entertainment system is not working. We suggest you read a good book and go to sleep'. This was on a flight Buenos Aires New York about three years ago stated in Spanish and English by a flight attendant. Passengers laughed but you could see many were offended by her suggestions. It used to be a great carrier.,Detractor

"Started with boarding of second leg from Keflavik to Dublin, noticing a substitute plane from National Air (Dubai). Not what was the usual WOW aircraft. It did not takeoff with claims of engine problems needing to be checked. After many approximate 2 hour delays, and no WOW reps at their service desk to answer questions, and no email notifications, all passengers were transported to a nearby cafeteria and given a meal, and then checked in to a hostel style hotel (converted army barracks) with a few passengers including myself being told that the hotel was full. All hotels in the area had no vacancies. The flight was finally able to depart in the very early morning, some 18 hours later. I was forced to book another airline to Belfast and a bus to Dublin to reach my destination a day and a half late, losing a paid booking for a night in Dublin and getting very little sleep in Iceland night.

" Boston to Oslo via Keflavik. My first time traveling through Keflavik was 3 years ago and since then they have made improvements and expanded, a little. I've flown into and out of Keflavik about five times and the last two times were kind of a nightmare. It doesn't bother me that we unboard on the tarmac and get bussed to the airport doors. It doesn't bother me that options for food are limited and mediocre. I do like the spicy tuna sandwiches at Joe and the juice. I like to also fill up my water bottle with some wonderful Icelandic water from the fountain . What really upsets me is that the gates are too close together and there is no where for you to sit and wait for your plane without being in the way. Like other reviewers have stated it can be a nightmare when there are multiple flights landing and leaving within minutes of each other. Chaos should not be part of an airports experience. The last two times were truly chaotic because no one knew where to line up, or even if they were at the right gate because the lines extended down the terminal. In fact, on my most recent flight we were told by an Icelandair employee to NOT form a single line because it would be too long! I don't like queuing up or waiting in line for too long. I'm at an airport so there's nothing I can do about that. What really gives me anxiety is when there is no line but rather a herd of people forming a bottleneck to get their boarding pass scanned. On this last flight, there were multi times when someone got upset because another person or group got in front of them. I don't know who is to blame for this terrible design.

"Maybe I've just flown US carriers too much, but I think British Airways is a cut above them, as it has been in the last few years. They take care of you during the flight.

Hot meal service to begin with a better than average beef offering, and then a sandwich, tea, etc before landing. I am part of their frequent flyer program and was given a different seat from the one I had selected - the seat just behind the bulkhead. Ordinarily I don't like those seats as there's nowhere to put your things when the plane takes off, but I was in the middle and the three seats between me and the man in the other aisle seat in my row were empty (presumably this is why I was moved to this seat, as it was ""better""), so I just used the seat beside me and it worked out fine.

"  Dubai to London. Having flown on an Emirates A380 to Dubai the fit out of the Qantas A380 was very old and was not worth the very expensive fare we paid. I have flown with Qantas for more than 50 years and been a FF most of that time but in future, if I have a choice, I will use another airline - Emirates if available. To make things worse, QF discovered a fault with the plane so after more than 2 hours in a hot aircraft we were off-loaded. The plane was scheduled to leave Dubai at 9am. It is now 11:45am and we are awaiting another update at 12:15pm. QF seems to be having a few problems at present. Is it old aircraft or inadequate preventive maintenance or a bit of both. A lot of reasons right now to use airlines other than Qantas.",Detractor
"  Detroit to Newark. My mom has been working for United for over 28 years so when I fly I use her buddy passes. Using her buddy passes this means that I fly standby (which means I only get a seat if one is available). I decided to fly home for the weekend so I decided to fly from Detroit airport to Newark on June 23rd. There were about 15-20 open seats on this flight so I knew there should be no problem getting on the flight. There were a few delays due to air traffic control and that is normal and expected on a busy day like Friday. After waiting a few hours in delays, it was finally time for my flight to board. I stood right by the podium as I waited for everyone to board and once they finished I went right up the front desk to ask if any stand bys have been called yet. The lady said she wasn't sure and that she had to wait for one of the other agents to come back because she would have the answer. I waited about 5-10 minutes for the other agent to go back and I nervously kept looking at the screen to make sure that I didn't miss my name being called but the screen still said ""Boarding"" and my name was not checked off the screen yet despite all of the empty seats. The United agent finally returned and when I asked her about the stand by's she had nothing to say to me. All she said was that the doors were already closed and that I would not be making it on the flight. I did not understand what she was saying because there were no announcements made AT ALL about final boarding. Not only did the agent forget to call the whole stand by list, she never announced that boarding was coming to an end. Before the flight even began boarding, I specifically went up to the Agents and told them I was flying stand by and I asked them if they would be calling out my name so that I could receive my ticket. They assured me they would call me once everyone else was boarded. However, this was not the case at all. While this whole ordeal was happening, I was talking to my mom on the phone who told me that she never has seen something like this in her 28 years of flying. She was very upset by this as was I and instructed me to see if there was something else I could talk to. When I asked the lady if I could talk to someone else about this problem, she told me there was nobody else I could talk to about this issue. The lady then began to ignore me when I continued to talk to her about this problem. I was absolutely baffled on how an airline could just get away without giving a final boarding call for a flight. There was also another person on stand by who missed out on this flight because the agents never made the proper announcements. This was the last flight out for the day so it caused me to be stuck in Detroit for the night when this never should have happened considering there were over 15 seats open. Not only did the lady refuse to help or even tell me what happened, she failed to do one of her basic duties as an agent - which is make the proper announcements. I am a college student who cannot afford to pay to spend a night in a hotel so this left me in a terrible situation. I have flown United my whole life and I have never been so disappointed with them as I am today.",Detractor
"  Minneapolis to Ft Myers. I booked a flight to see my family over Christmas, with my two cats, using the same TSA-approved cat carrier I've flown with at least 10 times. We're getting ready to board and an agent suddenly tells me the carrier is â€œtoo bigâ€ and won't fit under the seat, and that she was â€œgiving me extra timeâ€ to â€œgo somewhere in the airportâ€ and BUY a new carrier. Wouldn't listen to any evidence that the carrier is TSA-approved and collapses down to fit under seats. I even demonstrated it and told them I had flown THEIR airline many times before, with that carrier, with no difficulty. Supervisor wouldn't listen. So I wheeled my cats in a wheelchair back and forth from one end of the Lindbergh terminal to another, desperately looking for a pet carrier in the shopping areas, but no luck. The store clerks were incredulous that the gate agents had even suggested that. On top of all this, the agents placed all the blame on me for not â€œknowing the dimension requirementsâ€ and would not acknowledge the carrier adjusts to fit. By that time my cats and I were both upset and the Spirit staff were even then totally unhelpful. The first woman even accused me of trying to â€œsuffocateâ€ my own cats by fitting the carrier under the seat. I'll say again that I've flown with that cat carrier many times without incident. They didn't care that it was the holiday season and did nothing to help me - all they did was change my flight to one three days later. Luggage was already loaded and â€œcouldn't be taken off.â€ What awful customer service - hostile attitudes, ridiculous suggestions. Totally ruined my trip and stressed out both me and my cats.",Detractor

YVR-TPE-YVR Elite cabin (747-400). Seat was very comfortable with good recline and footrest. Good pitch. Service for YVR-TPE was excellent with good attendants and drink runs every hour virtually on the hour. TPE- YVR service was less personal with fewer drink runs but still far better than most North American airlines. AVOD responsive with good selection of movies TV shows and others. Pillow and blanket offered and slippers with amenities kit. Where they faltered was the catering food was plentiful for me but definitely on the bland side. Elite seats are worth the money for 10 hour plus long-haul. I walked to the back to check out the economy seats and they frankly looked a bit horrifying - narrow with 3-4-3 layout and seemed a bit thinly padded. Ground crew at both YVR and TPE efficient and polite. I would gladly fly EVA Air Elite again.,Promoter
" I am really disappointed with American Airlines. I got one cancellation and two delays for my flights. It was not delayed because of the weather problems, but because of maintenance problems. Moreover, my flight was supposed to be at 10.30 am and they just arbitrarily changed our flight to 10.00 pm without explanation. I wanted to get a refund and change my flight to another airline because I have an important schedule. However, they just say they are not sure whether I can get a refund or not.

"London Heathrow to Bangkok via Beijing with Air China. I will never fly with this airline again! The worst of the experience was the lack of service regarding food and drink. On our return flight yesterday we boarded and received our lunch within the hour of takeoff as expected, however, we weren't offered any more food or even water, particularly the water, apart from once within the next 7 hours! We were next offered a meal and a drink less than 2 hours before landing at Heathrow. Apart from being thirsty and hungry, my inflight monitor wouldn't work on the last 10+ hour flight. On the earlier flights, inflight entertainment consisted of outdated films and tv. Not sure what the flight attendants got paid to do - only positive think I can say is that the toilets were clean so maybe they were all on toilet cleaning duty! Arrived at Heathrow late early evening to discover our 2 suitcases hadn't arrived - along with dozens of other peoples baggage. This apparently was due to one hour flight connection time hence baggage of passengers were not put onto connecting flight (last call for connecting flight was out on landing at Beijing. Big thanks to Beijing airport staff for rushing us all through, but no help from Air China staff). Lots of queuing to complete form for missing luggage at airport. Needless to say, we missed the train we'd booked home to Yorkshire. Finished up having to travel home in t-shirts and flip flops in freezing UK weather as we had winter coats and shoes ready to change into on arrival at Heathrow!

" London to Houston. This was the 1st time I flew with United and sent them a message on Facebook messenger. an instant reply and after a discussion they kindly upgraded me to an economy Plus. Flew from Dublin to London (LHR) with Aer Lingus and was met a United Representative on disembarking the flight due to my short connection time which was an hour I was fast-tracked through flight connections and security. Instead of walking from the main terminal building I was driven right up to the gate where the United flight was parked. As I entered into the satellite building the boarding staff were professional and took consideration that I was deaf and allowed me to pre-board before everyone else. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 reg N78009 and it looked like it was ageing so it was. The seat for 22L was comfortable but as it was a 10-hour flight the extra leg room was worth it for the comfort if you are 6 foot tall like me and it is a good seat as I was happy with the legroom and a good whole window to yourself as seat behind me did not have a window. Despite that, the 20-year-old aircraft (almost as old as I am), the actual flight was smooth no problems was very impressed with the attentiveness of the crew and was well looked after with drinks and snacks for a 10-hour flight. The meal was Thai Green curry and dessert was chocolate ice cream. I was very impressed with the airline, the crew and was beyond expectations for me. I would definitely fly with United again from London (LHR).",Promoter

"  Athens to Rome with Alitalia. We had the bright idea to do a web check in, but the family was allocated different seats. Called Alitalia in Athens to ask if this could be changed as a family with a 3 year old must be seated together, and told that this was a computer allocation and that they would help us at the airport. At the counter we were told they could not help us but as the flight was far from being full they would help us at the gate. And of course at the gate they referred us to the cabing crew who in turn told us that they could not help us and that we should have asked for assistance at the counter! The snack was a mini sandwich with dried meat. On our way back at Fiumicino they could not check the toddler's push trolley like in every other airport and sent us to the airport door with the trolley as there was no other way to check it in. At least they printed a badge to stick on the trolley. (The trolley was promptly delivered at the belt of Athens airport.)

"  We travelled home from Brussels to Manchester, and quite the most awful airport/airline experience we have ever had. Our flight was rescheduled over 3 hours earlier with less than 48 hours notice and due to the airport only being accessible to cars and taxis we had to pay an exorbitant taxi fare (more than the cost of our flight!). Unable to rebook on a later flight as Brussels Air agents` phones continuously engaged throughout. Utterly excessive security at the airport, we had our boarding cards and/or passports checked 6 times en route to the plane, and had to queue in the rain just to get into the terminal. No signage as to the revised parking/access arrangements outside the terminal so the taxi went round in circles clocking up more tariff! We have every sympathy with the lovely Belgian people over the recent tragic events but Brussels Airlines and the airport authorities appear to have ditched all concept of customer care in the aftermath and are leaving travellers with no choice but to like it or lump the bills. Best to avoid Brussels Airport completely until it`s all back to normal, whenever that will be, and choose another airline when it is.",Detractor

Recently returned from Mauritius to Gatwick in Club World and have to say that the service was woefully lacking. Left on time. The cabin crew were obviously tired and the welcome glass of Champagne was served without smiles or a welcome. Throughout the whole flight the crew did the absolute minimum and there was very little interaction with the passengers. Breakfast was disgusting and served soon after take-off. A little round casserole dish of British Breakfast ingredients all piled together and searingly hot and overcooked and tasteless. Awful insipid coffee. After that some of the crew disappeared for a sleep and we were left to ourselves. Nobody asked if we wanted anything nobody chatted I rang for a drink and nobody came.

On asking for a glass (there were none) for wine I was told to sit down and one would be brought as indeed it was ten minutes later with no smiles or nibbles. Throughout the flight I felt guilty asking for a G&T or wine because of the negative attitude of certain cabin crew. Lunch was just about OK and very good wine. After that for the next five hours nothing was served to refresh us before landing - no tea no cakes no nothing. The seating configuration was 2-4-2 (Boeing 777) and packed in like sardines - claustrophobic for some. To access the aisle from the window you have to climb over the legs of the person behind and the food is served across the lap of the aisle seat over the partition. We were a couple but if you are travelling alone it could make for some very strange eye-to-eye contact with a stranger. The IFE was dated and a very limited choice with poor quality fuzzy screens. The whole package was so minimal soulless and lacking. Not once were you made to feel special or 'pampered' in any way. If there is an alternative in future to BA I'll take it and compared with some Middle-East airlines the Club World product is embarrassingly mediocre. BA needs to refresh review and up-date quickly. Sorry BA - you've lost me for the foreseeable future!,Detractor
"  Baltimore to Nice via London. My ordeal started when I could not check in online. I called BA and they said the flight is under airport control and I have to check in at the airport. Fair enough but I should have known something was wrong. When I get to the airport 3 hours ahead (I wanted to get a good seat) I was told that Premium Economy was overbooked, and that I was involuntarily being bumped to economy. Never mind that I bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago. The staff were not even nice about it. Quite beligerent. They offered me a Compensation card for $94. Where they got this amount, I don't know. I would have preferred the seat. Then they tell me I need to contact BA for a refund of the difference in price. Why should I need to contact them? They moved me, they know they moved me, shouldn't it be automatic? So I am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake. I did send an e-mail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them. It has been a week. I had a horrible flight. I have severe back pain (one reason I booked premium, for the extra room) which was made worse by my economy seat. My screen did not work for movies, although the flight attendants did try. It is as though they wanted to make me have a bad trip. Fast forward, while in France, I tried to use the Compensation Card, declined. So I tried to use it on Amazon and Nespresso online. Also declined. Really BA? I sent another e-mail telling them the card is not working. Nothing. I have flown BA in the past and have been happy with the. Not anymore. I have had it with BA. I will not fly with them again because when there is a problem, they do not come through.",Detractor
 I've had the most horrid experiences with American. I've been delayed both flights to North Carolina from Washington and back by at least an hour. I was supposed to get in tonight at 845 and catch my bus to Bellingham from Seattle but they delayed the fight at the last minute didn't bother to say anything and I had to pay for another full bus ticket to get home. Coming up I was delayed an hour as well. I think mainly their boarding protocols and strict baggage guidelines and I don't read the times points to there bad satisfaction for me. Planes are nice though but that's about it. Of all the airlines I've flown American has the most delays beyond anything I've seen and do not want to travel with them again.,Detractor

"  Toronto to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. Having had my original flight out of Montreal cancelled and rerouted through Toronto with a 24-hour delay, I was bracing for the worst. Contrary to my expectations, everything from check-in through to landing was in perfect order. Flight pulled from the gate slightly behind schedule but landed early. On board, the hard product was starting to show its age with worn out seats and trim. The cabin crew were excellent with smiles all around and very attentive service throughout the journey. The food was not up to TK's usual standard and having flown them long distance multiple times in recent months, I have noticed the quality and quantity have deteriorated. The wines served were the same as what they had on board back in September of last year but plentiful nonetheless. The IFE had a good a selection although it could have benefitted from more recent releases. The seat was comfortable allowing me to get 6 hours of restful sleep. Toilets were kept clean throughout the journey. It was a pleasant experience on the balance and the cabin chief deserved special mention given how he handled my request to be moved to another seat.",Passive
ADL-LHR via HKG. Check-in at ADL quick and easy well organised. Unnecessary delay with boarding process resulted in 20 mins late take-off. Stacked at Hong Kong landed 30mins late. Onward flight to LHR already closed so rebooked on later flight at 23:30. Given a hotel voucher but this didn't compensate for losing my previously selected aisle seat and having to then travel overnight to LHR arriving 05:45 am instead of 20:30pm the previous evening. Aircraft meals and cabin service could not be faulted and Premium Economy definitely recommended on longer journeys just a great shame that ADL to LHR schedule obviously does not allow enough time for flight transfer at Hong Kong so don't expect to fly straight through. Cathay Pacific you need to get your act together because passengers that get up at 4:00am for an early flight expect to arrive on time.,Passive
"  London to Madrid. Iberia is the national airline of Spain and accordingly one would hope that this airline would attempt to create a positive first image of a nation famed for hospitality and good food and high standards of service. Sadly, this was not the case. On what was a very busy Saturday afternoon at Heathrow, I dropped my bag off at the BA counter shared with Iberia. This was quick and efficient. Boarding was via a rather remote part of the airport and I noted some elderly people struggling with steep stairs to reach the boarding area. As I boarded a flight a male flight attendant coughed in my face twice and made no apology. The crew with one exception were absent during the flight. What alarmed me was the robotic and insincere attempt to have a security talk. I was not impressed. Food had to be purchased and was not of a good quality at all. I was very disappointed. The aircraft was however clean and the seats comfortable. The captain only made one announcement at the end of the flight. Disembarkation was orderly. In view of the cost of the flight, I was rather disappointed.",Passive

ORLY-IST-CDG July 1. I always check in online to save time but shouldn't have bothered for ORLY-IST leg. I was at the airport at 8am for a 10.25am flight. I was misdirected to the wrong bag drop off point. I then joined another enormous queue. It took over an hour to simply drop off my bag. No dedicated lines for just dropping off your bag. There were incredible delays at passport control which was again compounded by a disorganised slow aircraft boarding which appeared haphazard and the plane left nearly 30 minutes late. I had intended have breakfast at the airport but this was impossible due to time delays. On board service was fine but disinterested. The A320 was a little worn on the way back. Boarding again was disorganised and unpleasant. These flights were in complete contrast to my CX flights (SYD-CDG-SYD).,Passive
Connected from Finnair to Air India DEL-BOM-GOI on A321 returned the next week GOI-BOM-DEL on a similar A321. Air India uses T3 at Delhi which is very convenient and their baggage allowance is very generous compared to other Indian carriers. Wanted to try their Business Class and paid extra for the luxury on the DEL-BOM-GOI sector: very pleasant and very good service with tasty meals. On the way back it was Economy and cannot fault their service here either because the legroom was good IFE worked well and their catering was adequate. The dinner on the BOM-DEL sector was actually very good in Economy. This is not the Air India I remember from years back they have improved considerably and seem to have added many new planes in their fleet lately.

"  Flew Kiev to Hong Kong via Amsterdam. KLM surpassed my expectations in terms of service quality and integrity. Booking at klm.com was easy. Options sold via simple and attractive interface. Mobile check in worked well. Bag drop at Borispil airport took 2 minutes. Boarding was a breeze. The plane was clean and looked fresh. Crews were polite and attentive. Eco comfort seating was lovely. Their European catering is strange, but since there is a full bar service, not much to be unhappy about. Transfer at Amsterdam requires lots of walking, but terminal is perfectly organized, signage is easy and smart, security search was efficient (but not overly fast), so I have easily made a connection of 55 minutes. My bag made it as well. On the plane I loved the Eco Comfort small and private cabin. The seating was perfectly comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment had loads of films and shows and kept me occupied for the whole flight. No USB, no touchscreen, but ok. I loved the crews (very friendly, hard working and caring). Catering was of very good quality. My Japanese option was delivered first and didn't disappoint me. Lots of drink rounds. Great plane. Sorry to see 747s being grounded and replaced. The only annoyance was an 80 min delay due to wrong balance of cargo load (the plane was 747-combi). Finally they unloaded the wrong cargo to let us go, but even after that we spent 30 minutes waiting for available time slot.

LHR to JFK thinking I was traveling on British Airways flight BA1506 only found out I was flying on a codeshare flight with American Airlines AA105 when I got to the airport. Check in was efficient and friendly and the flight was uneventful except for the crew who made the whole experience feel very uncomfortable. I have never experienced cabin crew like it. Its a given that everyone has an off day once and a while but some of the crews interactions with the passengers that I witnessed were uncalled for. Crew were short unfriendly disinterested and deliberately ignored some passengers. At one stage I was made to feel like a huge inconvenience when I asked for a paper towel to dry up some water I accidentally spilled. In the end I had to queue at the toilets as I was informed I was capable of getting my own towels as the crew were busy. When we landed and were disembarking the crew thanked me for flying the New American Airlines. I don't know why BA codeshare with this airline as the service standards are at complete opposites of the scale. When I book my next flight I will make sure I know what airline I'm flying so I'm not on a code share with AA.,Detractor

"GVA to MIA booked through Orbitz with Finair. I then found out that it was operated by Iberia. 24 hours prior to departure I could not print my boarding pass so I called Iberia. One agent explained that I should go to the counter because I had not booked directly with Iberia because of security reasons which made no sense to me. On the day of departure I went to the counter early to try and get seats with a bit more leg room (expecting to pay for it). 3 different agents tried to fix the boarding pass problem. I was asked several times to step aside and only after 1 hour and 10 minutes someone showed up and managed to resolve the issue in just a few minutes. As for better seats, no chance. I was told that nothing was left. No surprise, so many passengers went through their booking while I was waiting! Madrid to MIA was not very enjoyable, the entertaiment system did not come on and after rebooting, worked for 30 minutes and then the screen froze for the the rest of the trip. We asked 3 different attendants for help but only one tried to do something but it did not work.

"I only used American Airlines because they offered a direct flight from ORD to RDU when the others didn't. I checked through the website and saw that if I signed up for AAdvantage, I'd be allowed the first check-in baggage free. Imagine my anger when I checked in and was charged $25/bag. As I sat at the gate, I watched how other flyers had avoided the charge. Their too-large carry-ons were collected at the gate and checked-at no charge. No honest person would have thought these bags the correct size. After my arrival, I called customer service. It was a 40 minute wait. When I got through, the lady asked if I had the AAdvantage credit card. I said no. She said the baggage charges were correct, only cardholders are exempted baggage fees. This morning, I checked their website again and again. It is not easily followed. The credit card and the frequent flyer program use the same name. If you get the credit card, you are exempted the baggage fee. If you fly 20,000 miles in their program, you are exempted the baggage fee. It took plenty of clicks to piece this together. Later I discovered that the credit card requires a $3000 expenditure within its first 3 months before the flyer qualifies for the benefits.",Detractor

Lauderdale-Houston-San Diego, basically a full day to get home, my flight MGA-FLL was at 1am, so we got at the airport early to check in, and just like the first flight, our flights were not linked, so we had to get them linked at the counter so we wouldn't have to pick up our bags and check in at every stop.

I purchased 3 individual tickets separately (different itinerary), then 7 tickets at the same time and 3 people opted to do the transaction using their own credit cards. As soon as the purchase of the 7 tickets was confirmed, the price for the inbound flight went from A$686 to A$1140, although this was still Sunday, the 25th November, still within the Black Friday period promising the discounts. So we were forced to buy the 3 remainder tickets with the inbound flight on the next day (7 July). This morning I checked, and the flights on the 6 July were again down to A$686!!! I called and explained the situation but there is no way they could change the flights to the day before free of charge. I then tried again willing to pay the A$100 fee to get a refund (it was a 'plus' ticket and this is in the policy). It turns out the 'plus' doesn't apply because the outbound flight was a 'light' fare, in which case the whole trip becomes 'light' (so why are they allowed to sell it in the first place???). This Black Friday is the biggest scam I've ever seen because the increase the prices the day before and then apply the discount on the increase prices, so the discount is not the percentage promised anyway. The prices increase during the sales period.

Food was as good a you'd expect to get on board, I managed to get a window seat, which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board. Entertainment options were good.",Passive
"Paris to WrocÅ‚aw return via Frankfurt with Lufthansa. The flights were short, I think each less than an hour. Staff was professional and the sandwiches provided during the flight quite good. The Airbus planes operated for the flights between Paris and Frankfurt were new, hence, they were in good condition and also clean. But what really impressed me were the Boeing planes that were operated for the flights between WrocÅ‚aw and Frankfurt. These were old B737-400 planes, but they were in excellent condition and super clean, with leather comfortable seats and a nice vintage-like feeling that is hard to explain.",Promoter
"UA1541 (Tegucigalpa - Houston, 737 / Boeing 737-700), UA1699 (Houston - San Francisco, 789 / Boeing 787-900), and UA1 (San Francisco - Singapore, 789) on 17 Jun 2016. First, UA1541. Surprised to see that there was a personal screen, but it was with DirecTV and pre-recorded movies, and not available free of charge. However, in the end movies were made available free of charge, presumably due to slight delays on the ground at the start of the flight. Snacks (a small pack of zesty snack mix) and drinks were served, but you could buy meals (e.g. sandwiches, pasta, salad) if you wish. I bought a wrap, which was reasonable (a tad pricey, but I could live with it). I had wanted the sandwich but it was out of stock. Next, UA1699. In-flight entertainment was miles ahead since it was newer, though I notice the selection was less compared to my next sector which was a 16-hour international flight. Food was available for purchase, though the usual snacks and drinks were available free-of-charge. I did not buy anything, and survived on a zesty snack pack with Sprite. My seat was supposed to be window seat, but the window was misaligned so I had to lean forward to gaze outside. It was great to have no one sitting next to me in the middle, which enhanced the amount of space available considering that the Dreamliner in 3-3-3 seating is known to be rather cramped. Finally, UA1, newly launched earlier this month. I had expected it to be very painful to fly 16 hours on a cramped 787. It turned out to be uncomfortable but still bearable. Managed to get some light sleep, managed to be sufficiently entertained too. What failed me was the food. The first meal (dinner), I made the wrong choice and had a (vegetarian, but you dont know until you get it) pasta with just spinach, cheese and tomato sauce. Salad was as usual horrible. Luckily the ice-cream saved the day. In between I missed the turkey ham roll as I was asleep, but it was available at the back of the plane for self-service. That was helpful to stave off hunger pangs. The second meal (breakfast) was literally the worst in-flight meal I ever had. I did not have a choice as they had run out of the eggs, so there was only a (vegetarian again) noodle in some funky weird black sauce, with weird tasting mushroom, edamame (horrible again) and red pepper. Absolute disaster, so bad that my neighbour and I did not finish the food. Without the bun and butter I would have starved. Seat comfort-wise, legroom and width was okay though my friend who was a bit bigger sized and seated at the aisle could feel a significant narrower seat width compared to the other flights - his shoulders were up against the neighbour in the middle seat. Overall, service and food on board seemed to be not as good as my outbound flights from NRT to SAL via IAH, though the in-flight entertainment was better on the newer Dreamliner.",Passive
"Doha to Beirut via Amman with Royal Jordanian. I would never recommend this airline. Our flight was delayed in Qatar, and that made us miss our connecting flight from Amman to Beirut. Once we reached Amman Airport the front desk staff told us that we will have to wait for 6 hours in order to connect with the available flight. When we started telling them that this is not an option since we have babies with us, they were very rude, and told us to go decide what we want to do then come back to them. What is worse is that the connection flight was delayed another time for another hour. So we ended up waiting for over 7 hours in the airport with our children. I would understand that problems may happen with flights, but the rudeness I experienced with the Royal Jordanian staff was the worst ever. Moreover, they had no control over their flight details, since it was showing on the screen that boarding started and no one was their to check the passports and tickets of the passengers. It was even showing last call on the screen, and still no one from the staff showed up.",Detractor
" Keflavik to Montreal. I was dreading this trip after reading reviews, but want to give credit where it's due. I paid for a ""Big Seat"" which came in around Â£140 for both legs of the journey and good value in my opinion. Easily the most comfortable budget long haul that I've done. Plane in Reykjavik had a problem after we boarded but they had us off and loaded to another in around an hour. Staff seemed perfectly friendly to me. I followed their luggage rules to the letter given all the bad reviews! I fly twice a week with SAS who charge as much as I paid for this trip to go from Manchester to Copenhagen and their service is absolutely no better at all. So overall I am happy.

Positives - good food and drinks selection, friendly crew and the economy section of the upper deck A380 was quiet and pleasant.

"Naples to London Gatwick. The aircraft was fairly new (which made a nice change compared to the many ancient long haul planes we've flown on with BA). We'll ignore all the reasons for the flight being slightly delayed and go straight to our complaint: having left our hotel too early for breakfast we decided to wait for the food usually served on the plane. As we didn't land until 1pm we assumed there would be some lunch offered. We were offered a soft drink and the choice of a bag of crisps or a bag of nuts! We complained and were told that this was the policy on certain flights since the beginning of August. What a disgrace. We regularly fly BA and are silver card holders, however, we've decided to fly our next two long haul flights with Emirates. The BA planes we've flown on lately on long haul flights have been dated and not very clean, and the standard of the food in business class has gradually declined in quality. What other airline expects you to climb over a strangers legs or to have a stranger climb over your legs to gain access to the aisle? You can't keep waking people up and have no alternative but to ungracefully climb out! The older I get, the harder this is becoming.",Detractor
" Vienna to Sofia. The flight was delayed by 2 hours. The cabin crew was annoyed that they had to offer drinks to the passengers and passing by announced they would only give one drink per customer.

At the time of breakfast, they offered turkey sandwich when I had clearly marked my meal as vegetarian. This is after serving the vegetarian meal before. There is no room in overhead bins. The temparature was set at least 78 degrees probably more. It was hot as hell.",Detractor
 Barcelona to Gatwick. Absolutely a disaster airline. Took 100 euros for our 2 bags and didn't refund it as the flight was cancelled. Took all day to let the passengers know that Gatwick airport was closed and didn't offer an alternate route to London except to passengers that jumped up and down and made a lot of noise. We could not understand their English very well and finally a bloke came out at around 5 p.m. and said we could stay the night in Barcelona at their expense. We spent another 3 to 4 hours in a line before being sent to a bus area (no toilets) where there were 4 or 5 coaches but not ones that we could catch. Waited outside in the cold for about 2 hours before a coach pulled up and then it was bedlam. Every man for himself to get his bag on and a seat on the bus. Finally booked into the hotel about 10 p. m. and then up at 4.30 a.m. to get a taxi that we paid for to the airport to get a flight to England with another airline. Absolutely hopeless airline too scared to be honest with it's passengers.,Detractor
" Amsterdam to Athens via Rome. Alitalia currently offers by far the cheapest deals in premium segments and so I booked another roundtrip to ATH, like I did last year.

Meal was of much better quality then the standard Pasta dishes. Alitalia offers a hotel on all segments (ATH-FCO is just 1h35). Staff friendly and lounge in ATH is very good. Sky Priority well organized. All flights on time except last flight into AMS minor delay due to heavy wind at AMS. Crew has nice new uniforms.

"For a low budget airline, Icelandair provides exceptional service. During a recent trip to Europe, my flight out of Toronto was late to take off and I ended up missing my connecting flight to Frankfurt from Keflavik. However, Icelandair was able to make my experience very positive by providing a clear explanation for the delay, being apologetic for the inconvenience and providing detailed information on what to do during a 24 hours layover in Iceland. Icelandair paid for a hotel room, transportation and 3 meals during my unexpected stay in Iceland. At the Icelandair Hotel in Keflavik, the front desk agent even looked up bus schedules for me.

Flew with Ryanair for the first time from Alicante to Manchester. I had not printed off my boarding passes for the three of us. I was not able to do this where we were staying. They then wanted 45 euros from each off us to do this. I managed to get to a PC at the airport and do it myself. The queues for check in were like Russian Bread Queues from the 1970's. When we eventually go to the front the check in clerk next to our queue (without any notice) closed his queue and then his queue tried to push into ours. It was appalling and could have escalated into something nasty all due to the bad customer service from Ryanair. I also witnessed an elderly disabled passenger become very distressed when she learned she could not take her collapsible walking aid onto the plane even though she'd been told in advance that she could. She became very distressed as she could not walk without it and was not offered a wheelchair. Absolutely appalling treatment. I will never fly with them again terrible customer service.,Detractor

Travelling on a transatlantic flight is miserable but Asiana made it as comfortable as possible.

I recommend Asiana to anyone looking at a long distance flight.,Promoter
"Overall a very good product in First Class. Ground service at other airports is not on the same level as Frankfurt or Munich but that's to be expected. Food quality is good but could still be improved. One point I would like to critique is that the drinks menu promises a choice of champagne but usually there is only one of the choices on board. While I was never dissatisfied with the champagne that was offered it annoys me to be offered a choice only to hear that there really is no choice. Another points I would like to make is about the inflight entertainment system. First off I have to say that it has improved tremendously on the content side. Sadly there is still no improvement on the user input side which is very unresponsive and on the design of the ""Lufthansa Media World"" is still confusing and overly complex. Service from the flight attendants was very good but felt a bit scripted and unenthusiastic. The seat is excellent for lounging as well as sleeping and has plenty of adjustment options. A nice extra for the seat would be a massage function like you get on Swiss First and many other competitors.",Detractor
" Flew British Airways from Budapest to London Heathrow. Quite possibly the worst flight I have ever had (and I travel often). Generally when we travel, we try to pack our hand baggage light, as we check our heavier bags and it's more convenient for other passengers too. My partner and I had 2 briefcase-sized bags between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker. As more passengers boarded, most with as-large-as-possible carryons, the overhead lockers filled up. The flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads, takes out our bags, hands them to us and says ""I'm sorry but the space is needed for large bags"", telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us. Reducing our leg room to zero. How is this at all fair? I questioned why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry-ons, and was given the response that I would delay the flight if the bags had to be offloaded. I have no idea who at BA thought it would be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean ""thank you for bringing smaller carry-ons than everyone else, as a measure of our appreciation, we'll take away your leg room"". The general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention. Young adults barely out of high school, and who would be more suited to making coffees in a road services Starbucks, such was their experience at providing pleasant service. What a sad state of affairs. I will never ever travel British Airways willingly again, long haul or short haul. I would rather take a civilised one-stop journey with Lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct British Airways flight.",Detractor

" This was my first long haul economy flight in a decade. After been fortunate enough to fly in the front quite often I was on a money saving effort and so did London Heathrow to Sydney return via Doha in economy. I scored a great fare in their annual January sale. I found the service was very good on all flights. I was in the upper deck economy cabin at the back and found the crew to be pleasant and also very responsive whenever I asked for another drink. The legroom was about as good as it will get in economy, which is to say it wasn't complete torture. It's up there with the best. The inflight entertainment was sufficiently diverse to occupy me for four long flights, with a mix of older and very new releases. I'd say one of the better systems. Oneworld sapphire and emerald members are treated as second class citizens. Staff were falling over themselves for a QR silver member (OW Ruby) on one leg of my journey which I found odd. This was until I realised that in Doha if you fly economy you don't have access to the regular business class lounge but a second tier lounge. Having experienced the Al Mourjan lounge previously I can say the Qatar business class lounge is less superior (think run of the mill AA lounge in the US). Overall the experience as a Sapphire or Emerald member doesn't matter to Qatar. I had heard that upper deck economy is reserved for premium fliers - this is incorrect. You will get first dibs on the seats, but then it's open season once online check-in opens. On my DOH-LON flight the lower deck was a third full whilst the upper deck was 3/4 full. I found the food revolting, particularly noteworthy was a chicken biryani from DOH to SYD. But it's economy so you get what you pay for I guess. Overall I would definitely pay for Qatar in business class, but an indirect route in economy is not something I'll be seeking out again. No matter how you dress it up economy is economy.",Passive
"I travelled with Air Canada rouge on the Dublin to Vancouver direct flight in June 2016. I have flown extensively on long haul flights and don't usually review stuff but I feel I need to on this point. The aircraft that flew Dublin to Vancouver didn't have the inflight entertainment facilities that I expected for a long haul flight (10 hours flight). Basically if you don't have your own iPad/ tablet to laptop you are unable to use the inflight entertainment system to stream the movies etc. Luckily they did have a limited number of iPads to loan (at a cost) on Dub to Vancouver flight - on the return flight (similar aircraft was used), the flight was full with passengers and there were not enough iPads on board to loan out to passengers. I had to use my small smartphone but as I didn't know I needed to have the Air Canada rouge app on my phone the vast majority of movies/tv shows I could not watch, needless to say the flight home was very very long and I was very disappointed. Air Canada rouge should have notified their passengers that if they wanted to use the inflight entertainment, passengers should bring a suitable device and have their app downloaded prior to boarding flights.",Detractor

Good selection of soft drinks plus a small bottle of red or white wine for the meal. Hit some bad turbulence just as the meal service started so the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and made an announcement that the service was suspended. This went on for most of the flight. The crew managed to check the cabin to ensure that passengers were ok which was very commendable, considering how bumpy the flight was. The turbulence subsided about an hour from landing at Athens and the crew recommenced the full meal service, understanding that time was against us. All trays and cups were cleared with 10 minutes left before landing. We landed at Athens 50 minutes early. Full marks to the crew who handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and charm. They never appeared stressed and were a comforting sight for many uneasy passengers.

She was then told by the same woman that was the host on our row â€œbe careful not to drop the keypad as this equipment is very expensive to replaceâ€. Then when my sister asked for a pillow the other air hostess just ignored her and rushed off for a break. These two individuals made us feel like we were a liability and made us feel extremely unwelcome. A demand for change of seats was declined too.

"Just flew with Qatar Airways from Perth to Barcelona via Doha, and Barcelona to Singapore via Doha to experience three aircraft types. The daily Boeing 777 service from Perth to Doha is excellent and we prefer to fly the Boeing 777 when we can. We enjoyed the A330-200 service from Doha to Barcelona and return, then had our first crack at the A350 from Doha to Singapore. First thing to say is the service is consistently excellent in Business Class with Qatar, and we would love it if Qantas was aligned with Qatar, which is our airline of choice over Emirates, even though this costs us in terms of status credits and frequent flier points. Qatar is a step ahead of Emirates, but QF frequent fliers are penalised if they choose QR. We were not overly impressed with the A350, especially with no independent air vent (something shared with their 787) and we find it a little warm on our flight. We also had a small problem in our seats in the A350 with the divider being stuck in the up position which meant my wife and I were separated to an extent we would normally not experience. Generally, the Qatar Airways experience is outstanding, including the lounge in Doha, although the restaurant in the business lounge no longer offers an a la carte service which is a disappointment. Overall we'll continue to choose Qatar Airways above Emirates.",Promoter

Good great, seating options plentiful and comfortable, spacious, plenty of beverage options. Restrooms and showers clean and hygienic. Cabin crew efficient and courteous on boarding. Onboard service was fantastic. Plane food was filling and great (for plane food). Champagne was delicious! Ground staff on arrival to Bali were very efficient collecting our luggage and even gave us a cold bottle of water while we waited for our luggage in the business arrival lounge. Check in at Bali was a little bizarre. The counter in much further behind the regular check in and a couple of the Bali airport officials didn't know where the business check in was - strange.",Promoter

"  My husband and I have flown Alaska several times to LA before and have never had a problem with them. However, this time I was traveling back to Washington alone with my 2 year old. We called earlier and asked if someone would be able to help me carry his 40 lb car seat to the gate. They said if we arrived 2 hours earlier we could request a gate pass. So on the day of the departure we arrived early and found out that they wouldn't give us one. No explanation. So I had to carry the car seat, my luggage, and have my 2 year old running behind me to make it through the tsa screening and walk all around to find our gate. It was a terrible experience and I don't understand why they said one thing on the phone and then no in person. The actual ride wasn't bad but I don't think we will use Alaska Airlines again.",Detractor
JED-CAI on all economy A300 - one of my worst travel experiences ever. Departure was set for 3:45 am however plane was delayed on the ground for 1.5 hours and we ended up departing at 5:15 am. Delay apparently due to the fact that they left some luggage in the terminal. During the wait aircraft was hot and sticky and air conditioning was giving out hot air despite the 38C outside temperature. Cabin crew couldnt' be bothered to reassure passengers shrugging shoulders and showing no signs of care at all to complains. Water and refreshing tissues were eventually distributed but the ordeal was unbearable. Seats were small uncomfortable and ripped at parts. There was no inflight entertainment not even in-flight magazines.,Detractor
We were traveling from Orlando to Fort Lauderdale and found what we thought was a good rate. But once we added luggage ($220) for three checked bags and 2 carry on's (which we later found out were personal bags that should not have been charged ($90).

Also their weight limit is 40 lbs. where other airlines are 50 lbs. their website is suppose to look cute but instead it is very confusing and difficult to navigate or find numbers for customer service and get answers to questions.,Detractor

"Flew Etihad Business from LAX-AUH-BOM while going, and DEL-AUH-LAX while returning. B777-200 was used on round-trip between LAX and AUH. The AUH to BOM route was served by A340-600, and DEL-AUH by A330-200. My two favorite aspects of flying Etihad Business: 1) Personal Food and Beverage Manager. 2) Lie-Flat bed. The food is ""restaurant-quality"", and you can order anything from the menu at any time. The cabin service on all routes was excellent. In A340-600 and A330-200, there was no overhead compartment in Business Class to stow luggage for passengers in the middle seats (B777-200 doesn't have this problem). The wi-fi on Etihad works like a charm. Etihad's Business Lounge in Abu Dhabi has something for everyone when it comes to dining. Having said that, the operations at Etihad's Abu Dhabi terminal are far from perfect for transit passengers. So, if you can look past the hiccups at Abu Dhabi Airport, flying Etihad Business Class is a special experience.",Promoter

The wheelchair assistance in Sydney were great and the airline personnel was very considerate. Once on board, it was obvious that the senior crew member were very dedicated in her job. She provided pillow, blankets and a very ""personal touch"" to ensure one's comfort. Food was very tasty and more than 2 drink rounds were offered through out the flight. Inflight entertainment were shown over a public screen in this older aircraft. In newer aircraft, individual screens will be available. Upon arrival, the ground crew only provide wheelchair assistance up the ramp of the aerobridge and once inside the airport, it is expected that the travelling companion rendered the assistance.

It is a 5.5 hour flight (like JFK - London) and the first class seats barely recline. Not even a footrest! Now many airlines even on the longer domestic flights have sleeper seats. We usually don't care about the food on the plane, we don't wait to fly to get a good meal, but on the flight from Kona to Lax when asked if ""pizza"" was ok, my husband asked what was the other choice and the answer was ""pizza only""!

Each time coming home we have been unable to make the connecting flight and for some reason Qantas don't put you on the next direct flight to Perth but they reroute you adding signifiant delays to arrival and more flying time. The long haul economy esp on 747 has become quite dated and dirty in parts. In the future I will be flying Asian airlines to the USA and Canada who guarantee one stop to USA at a much cheaper price and who's airports have access to showers in case of a delay.

"MEL-PVG outbound 26/12/13 PVG-Wenzhou 26/12/13 PVG-MEL inbound 9/1/14. It's not the best airline out there but acceptable for the direct connection to Shanghai and value for money. Timing of flights meant meals were served just after takeoff and just before landing with not much in between (stewardess came around with water 1-2 times in about 5 hours many passengers went to the galley to ask for drinks themselves). Seats not much room but you tolerate that in Economy Class. Inflight entertainment is standard stuff albeit with a focus on Hong Kong movies and Cantopop. The Chinese service industry has still not mastered the art of the ""false smile"" so hostesses can seem surly and over-officious compared to other airlines. English announcements not of great quality which is not really acceptable on an international flight to an English-speaking Western country. They do provide English announcements even on domestic flights if there are any foreigners on board. On return flight they tried to put 3 of us (including a 3 year old child) in 3 separate rows although cabin staff sorted that out well. It's not a patch on Singapore Qantas etc. but for the convenience of a cheap-ish direct flight you can put up with it.",Passive

It wasn't a full flight and I had all 3 seats to myself so could lie down made the 16hours leg comfortable. Plenty of drink runs and the food was very good albeit a small quantity but it was spaced well so I wasn't hungry throughout. Attendants were attentive but some seemed disinterested and cabin service can get disorganized at times. ICE was great but did not use much and noticed its the same contents as before. Seemed like catering out of DXB was of poorer quality hence the return from LAX is better. Transit at DXB was good arrived in the evening so not a lot of people. DXB-DMM was a hit and miss food was very good or a 1 hour flight but cabin crew was very disorganized and always on a rush. Landing smooth and communication from the cockpits was ok.

Check in itself took about one hour because the system was down. Once my wife and kids (one child and one infant) boarded the plane they found that it was an old leased 747. They were seated all the way in the back - tables and footrests were broken. The level of service was extremely poor. Unfortunately the Jeddah - Khartoum route is completely neglected by Saudia in terms of quality standards (even though they are profitable routes) and i can't wait for the free-skies policy to take effect so that the competition either forces Saudia to raise its standards or to disappear. For me I have experienced similar problems on the Jeddah - Paris route and that's why I think that a three star rating is exaggerated - two stars maximum.,Detractor

"  Air Canada is showing some cheap attitude downgrading Premium Economy to just Economy Plus with such bad experience - in just over a year already their Premium economy has been homologated to what their Star Alliance partners Air China and SAS does. Last week flew Vancouver to Tokyo Narita and the service was the same of Economy except for the main course - after that is just the same drinks, the same snack, the same lunch. They keep the divider curtains open between Economy and Economy Plus section, only closed for the main course because it is different. Then flew Beijing to Toronto yesterday and it was even worse. Economy was full with 3-4-3 configuration and Premium Economy was almost empty - people from economy moving to PE (Economy Plus) seating there, the curtain open between economy and Premium economy. Now they have more Business Class seats with the bathroom in the back in economy for Economy and Economy Plus passengers. Never again Air Canada or Air China who have downgraded to a cheap product and charging the same of others whom are offering a much better product.

"  My recent flight from JFK New York to Sacramento via Atlanta was 24 hours from hell. Despite my efforts in trying to remain optimistic, experiencing disappointment after disappointment, I had to choice but to just be upset. I flew out of JFK on a rainy day, therefore all of the Delta flights were delayed. I found it curious that the online airline that experienced delayed take-offs was Delta that day, but what can you do? The delay would make me miss my second flight I need to get to my final destination. When I spoke to a Delta employee about re-navigating my flight, I was given very half-invested attention. From making jokes constantly with her fellow employee, to forgetting what she was searching for, she ended up booking me on my original flight in hopes we would make up time in the air. I just went with it, trusting a professional opinion over my own. Of course the flight was delayed even more and I missed my flight and the second option she put me on standby for. Delta accommodated me with a hotel and meal voucher. I the next available flight from Atlanta to Sacramento the next morning. Not anything you can do at this point. As inconvenient as this was, this is not the part of my Delta experience that really put me off. After finally arriving to Sacramento, I only an item that was at the top of one of my bags was missing and my other bag was missing altogether. When I finally received my second bag at home that night via their delivery service, the wheel was completely broken off and the side of my baggage had a big hole in it.

"  Johannesburg to Brisbane via Sydney. Very comfortable seats bulkhead window with plenty of space. Champagne on boarding was decent champagne as opposed to sparkling wine. Unfortunate 2 hour delay due to problems in starting engines - a sign of the age of the 747's perhaps, but the captain kept us informed and the crew supplied water. Once under way service was excellent, bar service with meal quickly following. Choice of two meals, including a beef stir fry which was very good. Good wines and attentive service throughout the meal. By this time my wife was asleep and slept for over 8 hours. She woke up once and the attendant produced a very tasty snack for her. The 747 is perhaps showing signs of age and is significantly noisier than the A380, but it is still a great aircraft. The small premium economy cabin is very pleasant, but so much depends on the crew who were top rate. Overall the premium economy service is good, and offers a lot of advantages, not the least of which is the lack reduction in queues and hassles. Due to the delay in leaving, a lot of connections were affected, but details of changes were made known before landing.

"  Mexico City to New York JFK. I was shocked by the horrible, unprofessional, incompetent way that I was treated by Aeromexico during my recent flight. Their deception, misinformation and incompetence cost me 8,612 extra pesos! I should not have been treated this way. I arrived at the Mexico City airport in the early morning, hours before my flight. I checked in at Aeromexico's check-in desk. The clerk checked my printed ticket and my U.S. passport and confirmed them. I asked if there was anything else, and she said no, that I was good to go. She checked in my suitcase and gave me the receipt for my checked-in bag. Then I went to my gate and waited several hours until boarding. When boarding began, I stood in line and eventually reached the front of the line, expecting to be checked in and board the plane. The Aeromexico employee at the gate asked me for the stub from my Mexican immigration papers, which I signed upon entering the country. The Aeromexico clerk at the baggage check-in had said nothing about this stub when I asked if there was ""anything else"" I needed. When she indicated that there wasn't, I placed the stub into my suitcase, which she then checked in. The clerk at the gate told me not to worry, that all I'd need to do is go to the Immigration desk and sign another immigration stub. She told me to sign it, then come back to the gate â€” that I could then board at the gate with no problem. That turned out to be a lie â€” or at least, radical misinformation. At her direction, I ran to the Immigration desk, signed a second immigration stub, and paid a 500 peso penalty, then sprinted back to the gate, returning just minutes after I had left. Suddenly the clerk at the gate had completely changed her tune. ""Sorry,"" she said, ""plane's leaving. You can't board."" I reminded her that she told me to go get the second immigration stub, return to the gate, and that I'd have no problem boarding the plane. The clerk brushed off my concern like it was of no importance and returned to chatting with a fellow employee. Upset, I went to the Aeromexico customer service desk. The clerk there told me not to worry, that this was no problem at all. ""There's a 9:05 am.flight to JFK,"" she said. ""Just go to the Aeromexico desk at L2 or L3, ask for the manager and have her switch you to that flight. It will be no charge."" But this turned out to be a lie too. I should have known something was up because the clerk refused to tell me her name. When I sighed, she told me again: Just go to L2 or L3, talk to the manager, and get the free reassignment. ""It's just a little bit of paperwork,"" she said. So I went to L2 and waited in line for 45 minutes to see the manager. When I got to the front desk, the clerk there said that if I wanted to get on the next flight, there would be a penalty - a 8,112 pesos. That's $453.65. ""It's Aeromexico procedure,"" they said. In the end, I spoke with 8 Aeromexico employees, but none helped, including the customer service help line. They told me they had no power to process customer service matters.",Detractor

SHA-PEK return. Inbound trip was with an A333 aircraft and the outbound was with B772 both wide-body jet but the latter has no fully flat bed. But considering the flight lasts less than 2 hours it's OK. The flight arrived on time and the services in the lounge and onboard were standard. Many domestic airlines offer Shanghai - Beijing route but I think Air China gives the best offering as far as both hardware and software are concerned.,Passive
"  Beijing to Melbourne via Shenzhen. I had a really tight transfer time less than 2 hours. But the luggage was fast and the transfer was smooth. They provided efficient check-in and boarding. The economy class cabin was clean and seat space was pretty generous. The cabin service was good, the crew friendly. Food and drinks made the trip enjoyable. Cabin and toilets were clean. Overall, China Southern Airlines is highly recommended and would fly with them again.",Promoter
FRA-ORD-LAX-OGG. All flights were in clean planes with enough legroom (I've 183cm of height). IFE on international flights depends on the aircraft but on B777 and B767-400 its working well with a good choice of movies. Staff friendly (with one exception) food compared to other airlines (e. g. Lufthansa) much better. We missed our flight in ORD due to a 45min-delay in FRA for which United was not responsible.

"On the upper deck on BA 282 (Aug 31st), although the equipment is relatively new, once you are in those hideous seats, you wouldn't be aware of what aircraft you are on. Squeezing as many ying yang seats onto an aircraft does not constitute a premium cabin experience. British Airways missed a great opportunity to enhance their club world product, but while other carriers improved their cabins, BA seem content in leading the race to the bottom. The crew on this flight looked as though they did mot wish to be on duty and one in particular was really obnoxious to a child. The child's parents were certainly mare tolerant than I would have been. Crew turned a blind eye to two passengers who decided to retain their luggage from the overhead lockers while the aircraft was still climbing and the seat belt signs were still illuminated. Once the food was served, crew were nowhere to be seen until breakfast was served. Due to the awful food served on this route on a previous trip, I ate before boarding so cannot comment what the offerings were on this sector. The 'Club Kitchen' is a complete waste of time. I did attempt to have a snack from the club kitchen during the overnight flight (after negotiating the outstretched legs of a sleeping passenger) but the unlabeled sandwiches were chilled out of their existence and were inedible. British Airways really need to up their game in respect of offering a premium cabin service.",Detractor

There was very little incline on the seats, however, the bottom of the seat moved forward a few inches. There was a foot rest on the seat and on the seat in front, which helped, but the seat is not well padded nor is there enough of an incline to allow for rest. The cabin crew was indifferent and not attentive. The big surprise was the food. I didn't make the trip for the meal, however, this was by far the worst airline food I have had. The entrees (both ways) were basically inedible.",Detractor

Aircraft boarding was swift and efficient and pilot was ready to go 10 minutes before scheduled time but ATC had a backlog and we had to wait 15 minutes before push back, then we were in a queue of planes waiting to take off. The cabin crew were very efficient and provided additional drinks while we waited. Seat was a shell type recliner and had adequate lumbar support. IFE was good worked properly and good choice of programmes. Meal served was good although method of service is somewhat odd as main courses are on a trolley and passengers choose as trolley pushed down the aisle. This is fine if you are at the front but passengers at the rear could get a cold meal. Qatar have a better system and Cathay Pacific should look at adopting a similar method.",Promoter
"A380 excellent aircraft. Awful Emirates service. I had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to London from Dubai. The flight was 3 hours delayed with the only explanation being that there was technical difficulties. Unless you travel by business class or first class you are treated like cattle and hearded on to the plane as such. Once onboard it doesn't get any better in cattle class. Requests for anything, like an extra blanket because it was so cold, are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request. I chose to fly Emirates only because of the A380 but if I knew the staff were going to be so rude I wouldn't have bothered. Next time I'll read the airline reviews before deciding how to travel. One good point about the aircraft is the Internet access, I can write this review while I'm on the flight.",Detractor
"  Moscow to Tyumen. The aircraft was changed in less than 24 hrs prior to the departure time.

I choose Aeroflot due to my airport preferences. It's located close to my home and job. In the last few years, Aeroflot has done a lot to improve their service quality comparing to disaster service they provided. Whole year of 2016 I flew with Aeroflot, and all Aeroflot flights which I flew with were overbooked. Now, in the fall, many Aeroflot flights are cancelled. In the beginning of December, this information appeared on their website officially. Please keep in mind that there's a risk that your flight can be canceled when planning your journey with Aeroflot.",Detractor

LHR-SIN in Business on B-747. Hard to find much good to say about this experience. Everything about the trip was chaotic and disappointing. Heathrow T5 a complete overcrowded mess. Flight delayed by 90 minutes as they couldn't get the jet bridge away form the plane and it took far too long than it should've to resolve. And to make it all worse BA had a global baggage IT systems failure which resulted in my bag not making it to Singapore (despite checking in several hours before the flight). The flight itself was average at best. Upstairs cabin comfortable enough although the plane was old and tired IFE limited food appalling. The only positive thing I can say was the crew smiled a few times through the awful flight which at least suggested they were trying. Can't imagine how BA can compete with SQ on this route given the absolutely dreadful nature of what was once a much better airline than it is today. They have no idea where my bag is or when I will get it and you can't contact BA in Singapore on the weekend as they are closed. One just gets the impression they couldn't care less. Would not recommend.,Detractor
"Adelaide to Auckland (then NZ553 on to Christchurch, which is not reviewed). In a word everything about the flight was average. The best feature was that the flight departed and arrived early. The flight crew were not unpleasant, merely disinterested. Service of meal and drinks was slow. The meal was only typically airline food, with no obvious reference to New Zealand. The seat was comfortable but knee room seemed somewhat restricted. One of the three toilets was out of action, leading to queues for the others. The entertainment system worked and had a long list of options. I have flown on several airlines that I would rate much more highly than Air New Zealand",Passive
LAX-HND-GMP-HND-LAX 772 and 763. HND on the older 777-200. Seat is slightly harder but not uncomfortable during each 10+hour flight. I am 5'10 with long legs. Seat pitch just good enough. TV's sufficient for the purpose with just enough English offerings doing two red-eyes. However half were 'classic' movies so you may run out of new things by second leg if you do not sleep. One complete meal prior to landing with a snack after departure. Snack was a bit lacking but the meal was good. Service is truly excellent. Staff is very polite but English levels vary greatly. 767-300 intra-asia. Same entertainment better crew English levels? full meal despite 2 hour flights.,Promoter
"All 4 flights I took with Air Europa on my recent trip to Havana via Madrid, were either late departing, late arriving or both. The transfers were chaotic and badly organised. The first flight UX1014 to Madrid left Gatwick late, arrived late and as such I ended up running for the next flight UX51 to Havana. When checking in I asked if luggage had made it on the transfer and was told by the gate crew all luggage had transferred ok. On arrival in Havana, the plane was 45 minutes late as it had no docking bay. Amidst the total chaos at Havana airport and with no assistance from any staff or Air Europa representatives I had no alternative but to wait to see if my bag turned up, after waiting 4 hours and by 12.30 am to see if my case arrived I was told â€˜no more bags, maybe later'? I queued for another hour and eventually reported the loss to lost property and was given the receipt. As a result of these delays I missed my pre paid transfer and had to hire a taxi to take me to Havana at a personal cost of $30. After numerous calls, messages to the lost property etc I was eventually reunited with the bag 5 days later â€“ when I was in Trinidad, Cuba some 3 hours away. I will not bore you with the details of the arguments I had regarding who should pay for me being reunited with the bag, enough to say when I was told I would have to pay $400 for a private taxi to bring it to me in Trinidad my patience snapped. To continue on my cycle trip I had to buy toiletries,spare clothes, bag to carry them etc all of which I don't really want or need, I had to borrow socks and other items all of which is incredibly embarrassing and inconvenient. I had been no better than a nomad for 4 days on what should have been a great holiday, begging and borrowing, carrying my possessions around in a carrier bag. In addition to the loss of my bag I actually reserved on Air Europa web site seats prior to departure (at a cost of Â£48) which I did not receive these on the return leg â€“ no explanation just â€˜this is the only seat' at check in? Despite over 40 emails and letters to the airline they continue to ignore all responsibility to the point when I call and speak to someone in English they hang up on me!Customer serivce with Air Europa doent seem to matter at all I will do everything in future to avoid flying with them.

" Etihad is the epitome of 'okay'. The first leg of our flight was on a tired looking A330, the cabin of which was looking decidedly dated and the IFE hardware not particularly responsive. The flight attendants were not overly friendly or helpful which was fine but they did not give the impression of working for a premium, full-service airline and I've probably had friendlier crews on easyJet flights. The best that can be said for the meal on this flight was once again, okay, nothing to complain about but nothing exciting either. Although, the use of steel cutlery is nice to see. The primary benefit of transferring at Abu Dhabi is its small size meaning that its relatively easy to get from one gate to another for connections but it was also easy to tell how cramped and crowded it would be to spend more than an hour here for a stopover as the airport certainly needs to expand to meet demand. AUH's most interesting feature is its security policy whereby hand luggage is scanned and passengers made to go through metal detectors which every, single, person seemed to be setting off, including myself, despite having nothing on me and not having had any issues at EDI. This then means being patted down in a small curtained area with an unfriendly and unspeaking member of security staff. Not only this, but once passengers arrive at their gate everyone on our outbound flight (though only certain people on our return, we were waved through without searching strangely) was having their carry-on hand searched which seemed slightly excessive giving all the security measures passengers have already been through up to that point. The next leg of the trip was on a relatively new A380 which had a modern cabin and great IFE system despite the seats being uncomfortable this felt like a much better flight. The crew were marginally more friendly than the EDI-AUH leg but still did not go out of their way to be courteous or helpful for passengers. The most disappointing thing on this flight was the food, not its quality but lack of quantity. There are no menus in economy which is fine but would have been a nice touch. We were served a dinner after takeoff of which there were only two options left so I chose the pasta which was delicious and came with a salad, roll and small pudding. But during this 13 hour flight we were only given one more 'snack' of popcorn and then a breakfast of cinnamon roll and custard before landing in Sydney, at half past five in the evening. This was not enough food for the length of flight. Our return flights were of similar quality the only issue being the check-in staff at Sydney Kingsford Smith airport. Passengers were queuing for check in as it was shown as being open for this flight on the overhead monitors however, the ground staff were all standing behind one desk chatting, laughing, hugging each other and not one desk was open yet. After standing for half an hour and a now huge queue having developed with several people going over to ask what was going on check-in finally opened. Once we eventually got to the bag-drop counter we were greeted by an unfriendly man who answered my request to print off our boarding passes with 'obviously'. Not a good impression. Overall the experience of flying with Etihad was just fine, nothing more or less but I would definitely try another carrier for a long-haul flight before ever choosing them again as even though they were the cheapest option it certainly shows.",Passive
"  London Heathrow to Panama City return, via Frankfurt. I've been flying with Lufthansa for a long time but the flight to Panama was the first long-haul one that I've had using this airline. Lufthansa didn't let down and their service was really great. Flight from LHR to FRA departed on time. It was a short flight and we received snacks. Cabin was clean, crew very polite and professional. Arrival in FRA was on schedule. Transfer in FRA took more than 2 hours so there was plenty of time of getting to the required gate. Boarding started on time. The only little con, however, was that we were taken to the plane by bus, despite the fact that it was an A340-300. Cabin crew welcomed us with smiles. The plane from FRA to PTY also departed on time. Throughout the whole flight crew was present and did their best to make us feel as comfy as possible. There were 2 hot meals, snacks and plenty of drinks. What I can recommend Lufthansa, though, is to enlarge an IFE choice, especially the movie collection. For the rest the service was great and we've arrived in Panama on time. I will definitely be using Lufthansa services in the future and can recommend it to everyone.",Promoter
" Dallas to Sydney. The plane was excellent, seats were comfortable and reclined more than I anticipated. I liked that there was a camera at the tail of the plane, so you could see the take-off and landing, despite not having window seats. There was a huge variety of entertainment to listen and watch, the seat has a USB port to charge devices. We sat near the end of the plane and the staff that took care of us were extremely friendly, kind, and accommodating. My request for a gluten-free, vegan meal was missed, but the staff gave me options based on what they had available and even advised that I call the airline a few days before my next flight to ensure my request was confirmed for my trip home. Unfortunately, one of our luggages got lost (we weren't the only ones from the flight and apparently the same happened with my brother), but Qantas was great at handling it - they provided us with two personal kits (pjs and some toiletries) and a pre-paid credit card to purchase some new clothes in the meantime. We got our bag back after 2 days, when we arrived in Melbourne. We will be going back to Oz again and we definitely be flying with Qantas when we do!",Promoter
Round-the-Worldticket. JFK-LHR-TXL on 28/29 July 2014. TXL-LHR-MAN on 2 August 2014. All flights on time. Great service from cabin crews. Meals and drinks absolutely fine - no complaints at all. Lovely lounge at TXL small but more than made up for by the local staff in the lounge. Check in at TXL was a bit chaotic as there is hardly any space for waiting passengers. NCE-LHR on 30 August 2014. Flight left late missed landing slot and had to circle resulting in a missed connection at LHR to DXB. LHR-DXB on 31 August 2014. BA ground service was exemplary.

Baggage did not reach us in DXB until day of departure (not BA's fault) but BA refunded costs of essential replacement clothing. Flight was great ditto service from cabin crew.

Shangahi to Okinawa in business class. Check-in was efficient with a dedicated sky priority section and staff were friendly and efficient. The China Eastern Airlines Business Lounge is very difficult to find and not worth the effort to be honest. The lounge is a small crowded windowless room with a few food and drink offerings. While I was there the lounge was very crowded and very dirty although they did start clearing plates and tables as I was leaving. Boarding for my flight was very organised. The business class seats on the A319 were 2 2 across and were proper regional business seats rather than the usual economy seat with the middle one kept free that you get with BA. Soft drinks were served prior to take off then hot towels and a second drinks round then a full lunch which I have to admit was the nicest meal I have ever had on any aircraft. Arrived slightly late in Okinawa first off the plane thought immigration and baggage on the belt within minutes. I was very impressed with China Eastern and will try then long haul as I can live with the fact that the lounge in Shanghai is dismal.,Promoter

" My husband and I flew on British Airways flight BA-228 from Baltimore to London Heathrow leaving on the 12th February 2019. Every aspect of the flight was poorer than what budget airlines have to offer. The plane was shabby and dated. The seat reclining facility did not operate properly, was not that comfortable, and we had less legroom than the equivalent with budget airlines. The touch screen TV monitor was not working properly. One ear bud on the headphones did not work. The audio socket was too loose for the headphones so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in-flight entertainment (which in itself had a dated choice). The pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover. The air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air. The restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied. However what made the flight very unpleasant was the bad attitude of the cabin crew. They were abrupt, unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there. There was one exception, an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight. There did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co-ordination when distributing the meals. Our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member. This flight was one hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight. There was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed. Unlike all the other airlines that I have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re-assure them. British Airways would be my last choice of an airline to travel with and I would only fly with them again if there was no other option.",Detractor

" Durban to Houston via Istanbul. We had booked our flights from Durban to Houston (return) which included a stopover of 2 days in Istanbul whereby our journey from Istanbul to Houston was on 16th December 2018 on flight number TK33 at 2.30pm. We had requested wheelchair service in advance. We checked-in on time at Istanbul Airport and waited more than 1 hour for the wheelchair assistant who never came and had to walk by ourselves to the gate. By the time we reached the gate we were denied boarding as they said that we are late. As a result, we had to buy another ticket on Turkish Airlines for 18th December 2018 at the airport which cost us TRY 21519 and this was through no fault of our own.

After waiting 30 minutes on hold and then speaking to two different people, we were told the passengers to Paris were ""offloaded"" because the Paris leg was overbooked. The staff were rude and evasive. Contrary to EU rules they would not offer us passage on another flight except for 2 seats 2 days later. At the call center they would not confirm whether our entire flight was cancelled, which the text stated, or if just the two of us were ""offloaded"".

It was good that I was made aware of this a good few months before by trip. This meant I got to spend a couple extra hours in Kahului before heading back home to Newark. The flight to SFO was very good, the captain was funny and made a few jokes and the flight attendants were friendly. We were able to make it to SFO in about 4 hours and 15 minutes instead of the scheduled 5 hours. This meant I could enjoy a nice breakfast at the airport before my second leg. The flight from SFO to EWR was just as good. There was a wide selection of drinks and snacks as well as movies.

Paid 160$ to check two normal size and weight suitcases. All went ok flying into Chicago not many complaints except for all the fees. When we got to Chicago Airport we had everything ready and were 1.5 hours early for our flight. When we went to check our luggage we were notified that our connecting flight was cancelled. We received no email no phone call nothing. We were told we could either get a complete refund or fly to Dallas and wait a full 24 hours for our next flight. I asked the attendant if we would be receiving a hotel voucher anything. He said no they don't provide them. So we got to Dallas airport 2 hours late and were told that shuttles don't run after midnight. I asked the Spirit attendant if they would let us back into the terminal if we checked in so we would at least have a safe place to rest for the night. The Spirit worker said no and that normally they give out cots but not after midnight. I slept in a freezing airport last night on the ground going on hour 18 in the airport now. Just six more to go.

"  I had the worst flight experience with Finnair. I bought a Finnair round trip ticket from Madrid to Kansai via Helsinki although it was $300+ more expensive than their competitors on StudentUniverse, because they had shorter flight time (15 hours with one transit in Helsinki) and I really wanted to take advantage of my one week vacation to see my family. Once I arrive at the Helsinki airport (it was New Year's eve by the way,) I was told that my flight was cancelled. I had to wait in line 2 hours to be told by the service center staff that they cancelled the flight because they recently introduced a new type of aircrafts, and there were not enough pilots to fly this aircraft. I mean, what kind of an airline has shortage of their pilots, and if they are short on their pilots, why would they sell flight tickets? I was given two options at this point: take the same flight the day after, or reroute to Hong Kong, and go to Japan. I chose rerouting because I could get to Japan faster that way. In the end, I arrived at Japan with 12 hours delay from the initial plan and tired from longer flight time and increased transits. Of course I missed the New YearÂ´s day celebration because of this. A week later, I go to the airport to go back to Madrid. Once they opened the ticket counter, I line up in order to have some time before heading to the gate, so that I can have the last breakfast with my family. However, when my turn comes, the ticket counter staff tells me that my seat is not found on their record. I show them all my travel documents and my printed itinerary. I had to wait in line another 1.5 hrs while they figured this out. In the beginning they told me I had to take a later flight. I insisted they would get me on the original plane because of work. Because this was technically a JAL flight (it was one of those weird flights where you buy tickets under a company's name, but it's actually ""operated by"" another airline), I was sent to JAL customer support center, where they found out that my name was not on the list because when they rerouted my first flights, Finnair did not do the necessary process required to get me on the return flight. A JAL staff was very helpful and she was the one who pressured Finnair to find me another seat in the original flight. In the end Finnair gives me a seat they could find in Economy comfort, which is a slightly better seat than normal economy. I was quite stressed because until the last moment they kept telling me they were not sure if I could get on board, and of course when they finally told me yes, I could barely say goodbye to my family because I literally had to run from the security check to the gate. In the end, I could get on the plane, and I was in my seat. At this point I was willing to get over this flight and have nothing to do with Finnair for the rest of my life. Then, while IÂ´m reading, a couple comes to my seat, and asks me if I was sitting in the right seat. I show them my ticket, and they tell me, ""Oh no. We have the same ticket"" and shows me theirs. The cabin attendants had the nerve to tell me to move to Economy seat - (telling me itÂ´s ""exactly the same seat"" which was a lie because the Economy seat has less leg room and inferior amenities) I had no choice but move to the inferior seat, really wishing that I had never chosen this airline.",Detractor

The next morning we were waiting on our 5 AM cab ride to the airport and 4 prostitutes came walking through the door. Bottom line I can't believe American Airlines had the audacity to do what they did.",Detractor
" Dallas Ft Worth to Colombo via Doha. Boarding was chaotic staff at DFW were shouting at passengers trying to get them into correct boarding zone. The inbound plane arrived on time but we still left close to hour late. Crew was professional, friendly and proactive. Catering was poor with the exception of soup which was excellent. Food was not heated enough or did not appear fresh. The seat on this Boeing 777 has no privacy. Even with eye mask you can still detect seat mates IFE screen. Pajamas and slippers were nice touch and good quality. Blanket and pillows high quality. Crew kept toilets clean throughout flight. Landed late and parked at remote stand. Transit security was easy at Doha. Lounge is beautiful but signage inside was poor. Odd that the main showers are located behind the dining area. Had to ask staff several times for location. Doha to CMB left on time. Regional business class seat on A320 was fine for five hours to Colombo. Again the crew was outstanding, very professional and friendly. Catering was much better out of Doha.",Passive
"My wife and I took Vueling flight from Paris Orly to Vienna via Rome on 1 October. Upon arrival in Vienna, we realized that our baggage did not come out from the conveyor. I rushed out to the ground handling office to file a report. The officer record the report and gave the lost report document and mentioned that it will be delivered in 24 hours. I am not happy but I have no choice. The next day I called to follow up and the reponse surprised me: there is no information of the baggage! How could that be possible? The baggages are tagged, computerized recorded and transported using a registered airline, but somehow no one can get any information of where it is! However, since it is not yet 24 hours, I decided to wait. And as expected, day 2 passed in silence. I revisited the ground handling office in day 3 and again surprised me by saying that they will contact their colleagues in Paris and Rome. Weren't they supposed to do that since day 1? Will they ever move if I didn't show up? Later in the evening I sent email and received a shocking answer: a request to inform detail of what inside the bags, to help the identification. Are they now going to open the bag? I don't whether they are allowed to do that but I clearly showed that there is something not right. Later, evening of day 4, I received a phone call saying thay the baggages are found and will be delivered between 21.30 to midnight. Of course, I receive it on midnight. And as I guessed, it showed how the handling was done in poor manner. Broken handle, the wheels are hardly move, dirty, scratches because the cover is gone. Vueling will not be my ever choice to fly with.",Detractor

"I've flown China Southern internationally and domestic, the latest was a domestic trip Xian to Beijing. While they were okay longhaul from LAX, domestic standards are terrible. Done 5 different internal flights in China so far and this was the worst. Delay of 75mins at airport, not a word of apology from airport personnel or onboard the flight. The Captain was silent from start to finish - truly! My neighboring fellow passengers were coughing up phlegm most of the flight, all very unpleasant. Served some type of filled bun, but the smell deterred me and passed on this. Asked for coffee, the female FA shook her head, snarled something in Chinese and walked off. It is like 2 different airlines, and standards night and day when you compare international with domestic. If you have a little longer, try the train for domestic routes, or choose one of the smaller airlines here.",Detractor

"I was scheduled to fly SEA-SFO-JFK. Flight to SFO was delayed by 30 minutes, which meant I would miss my connecting flight to JFK. I was notified by emaila phone call and through the app that my flight was delayed. Within one click of the app, I was offered alternate flights, even alternate dates and airports without any extra charge. I was then rebooked to the nonstop flight departing an hour later but two hours earlier than I originally would have arrived. The agent at the SkyClub upgraded me to an exit row seat free of charge and apologized for the delay, which was minimal in the first place. The delay was handled extremely smoothly and I was rebooked, upgraded and taken care off within five minutes. The actual flight was good, on board a Boeing 737-900ER and despite being only a year old, the cabin was not properly cleaned and there was garbage on the seats. Legroom was excellent as there was no seat in front of me, although it was a bit hard to see the television - it was about six feet away, although DL was smart enough to put a remote control for these seats. Complimentary beverage served multiple times and buy onboard food options were decent. Flight attendants did their job, were quite friendly. Entertainment options excellent, with entire seasons of my favorite TV shows. WiFi was fast, although I recommend buying the 24-hour pass on the DL website or app as it's much more expensive onboard. Overall, a pleasant experience onboard but DL did a fantastic job handling the delay on the ground.",Promoter

The service was prefessional onboard the aircraft, and my needs were attended to. I was asked if I wanted to move to another seat to allow for a family with children to sit together. I agreed (I was originally sitting in a bulkhead seat for the extra legroom), and I was upgraded to Premium Economy!

The seats are extremely conjested and I felt very claustrophobic. I usually sleep any time on a plane but in no way could get comfortable on this flight. The seats are terrible, the TV screen is touching your nose, you get a coffee (drink) and cookie for you whole (6 hour in this case) flight (everything else costs something), and they said I'd have to pay another $70 if there was a free seat open next to my friend so I could sit with them.

There was no communication by the gate agent at all except to advise that the flight cancelled. This airline is deceptive - you seem to be getting a cut rate price, but after all of the hidden charges, you are better off with Delta, American or United.

I travelled from Reykjavik to Dublin recently and it proved to be one of the most pleasant enjoyable and entertaining flights I have taken. Our good fortune was to encounter a wonderful crew with a fantastic sense of humour in particular the air hostess who made all announcements. There was a spontaneous round of applause when she completed the safety announcements - I think it was the first time I ever actually listened to them - she was so funny and entertaining. She received her second round of applause when we landed - again a wonderful commentary on weather temperatures etc.It proves flights can be entertaining pleasant and enjoyable - and at no extra cost.

" Budapest to Rome. While I have nothing special to say about the onboard staff (they were neither nice nor rude, almost non-existent, I would say), I was appalled about the attitude of the Wizzair staff at the airport. First of all, the boarding gate did not appear on the display for long time (even though we were very close to the departure time). When it finally did, the number was accompanied already by a flashing ""BOARDING"" sign which put pressure on us. The gate was A17 so we followed the signs and at one point the signs indicated a direction for gates A12 - A19. Here it's when I noticed, on the side, a Wizzair staff screaming something which I could not understand so I went to her asking what is that she was saying and she was extremely rude and basically shoved us (not indicated) to another Wizzair staff (would have not been easier to put a sign akin to ""A12 to A19 except Wizzair passengers"" rather than having that rude woman screaming?"". So we went to this other person, this time a man who was checking the boarding passes and the size of the backbags without ever lifting his head and with the utmost scary expression. He sent me on one queue while my friends to another. When I asked him why, even though we were on the same flight, he sent us on two different queues, his brusque reply was: ""There is a difference, just go"". Is this a normal reply to someone who is asking you something? To a customer? I fully understood that it deeply bothers them when someone ask them a question, silly or clever that it may be, they just don't want question. I wonder why they chose this job and why there are allowed to treat people this way. Since this left me with an unpleasant mood, I will never spend another penny to fly with this company, not matter how cheap it is compared to other airlines.",Detractor
"Flew Auckland to Washington, the first two legs from Auckland to Sydney and Sydney to Dallas/Ft Worth with Qantas. I booked extra legroom seats in the small economy cabin on the top deck for my flight to Dallas from Sydney. This was a really good value purchase and the extra room was great. Managed to get a decent amount of sleep, crew were great, offering water, prompt service and really friendly. The return flight Dallas to Sydney was up against headwinds so took over 17 hours, my longest ever flight. A great selection of movies and TV options as well, once again, as great service made this flight not seem so long. Neither of the long haul flights were full which probably helped, but I was impressed with comfort, service and entertainment.

When I saw Spirit offering a flight for half price of the other airlines I jumped all over it without thinking or finding out why the fare was so much cheaper.

HEL-CPH-MAN on 2nd June 2015. At Helsinki airport there were no facilities to get checked in apart from Self Service machines.

"This was my first experience with United Airlines in probably 10 years or so, and I promise it will be my last. The flight from Savannah to Washington D.C. was awful. First sign of terrible service began on arrival at terminal check in. Every one of their systems were down. My sisters flight was no where to be found. Being frequent flyers we arrived early and it took 45 minutes to locate all our tickets and get us on our way. Lady was nice but by no means cordial in the way other customer service reps are. Our flight was delayed and upon arrival we missed our connecting flight to Munich. I know this happens and obviously causes frustration. However, this was only the start of it all. No flights were available until the following day. I am writing this review from the hotel in real time. When asked if we would be reimbursed for the hotel or upgraded for our inconvenience the rep literally laughed in my face and said that isn't our problem. I have never been more angry with a rep in my entire life. I spent 2 hours trying to call customer service and to my dismay was only able to speak to someone who clearly had just learned English a few months prior. Unbelievable disregard for customer satisfaction. As a Delta sky miles member I will never betray my airline again (this international flight was cheaper through United. Not worth the 350 dollar savings). I honestly can't comprehend with human logic how this company still exists. I am appalled and will never ever give 1 dollar to United Airlines again.

ORD-HKG Oct 10. First Class on Cathay commands a premium but in the end you get little more than a bigger seat. Consistency and orientation seem to be big problems. For example they seem to offer some F passengers an escort through security while others (like me) do not get one. They offered a padded mattress (duvet) to some passengers but not to me. For the most part I was ignored. The Inflight Service Manager introduced herself at the beginning of the flight then disappeared for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew delivers the meal then hides in the galley. They ran out of Heineken beer about 2 hours into a 16 hour flight. Don't get me wrongâ€¦ the flight is not awful. The seat really is big. They serve 1 can of caviar Krug champagne Johnny Walker Blue and so on but how much of that do you really consume? But it is a HUGE premium and from my limited experience the Business Class is a better value assuming you can get accustomed to the Cathay service. They are really very friendly but they basically ignore you.,Passive
"  Ponta Delgada to Lisbon. There are many factors that contribute to a satisfactory journey and unfortunately not all the expectancies were met for this flight. Let's start with the positive side and then see what was wrong and could be improved. The value for money was great, just 15 euros for a 2-hour-flight. I would never had booked this journey without getting a similar fare. It makes all the difference. Now it's time to see what could be improved. Ground handling: below the standards. The incoming flight was delayed, so they decided to start boarding when the plane arrived at the stand. That added more delay and resulted in a slot loss and in a 30-minute-delayed departure, that could problably had been partially avoided with a better coordination. The flight time was shorter than scheduled, so that we catched up the delay and we arrived just 5 minutes behind schedule. The onboard experience was good and being asked to move to a vacant seat in the emergency exit row gave some rest to my long legs. Awesome, isn't it? Negative score to the bar service: the food products we selected were unavailable and that was a pity. I don't mind having a snack or to dine on board instead of doing it at the airport, but with no guarantees about the products available, I'll start to consider the airport bars when flying with Ryanair.

This was a Tuesday! As if that wasn't bad enough the service reps responses were extremely rude and amounted to ""gee sorry who cares"". Already had paid their $50 bag fee which they had originally charged me $80 for. Their employees kept telling us the issue was air traffic control in Chicago but coincidentally nearly every one of their flights from anywhere to Denver that day were late or delayed not at all just Chicago.

What was worst is that the co-ordination between Air India check in counter and the airport departure notifications were repeatedly inconsistent in all my connecting flights causing many confusion and at one connecting flight I was almost late and got reprimanded openly and loudly by the staff when I was already racing to the different gate (that was on a different floor from that indicated on the Kolkata airport terminal). Disappointing I had thought that this is a state airline and was anticipating better service.,Detractor
" Never again! I do not recommend Frontier Airlines under any circumstance. We first flew from San Francisco to Washington DC and the flight was very bumpy and shaky. The real problem, though, was when my flight from DC to Denver (to fly back to SF) was cancelled out of the blue on the day of departure. This left me with no other option than buying extremely expensive last minute tickets from another airline (of course!) for the next morning very early. The fact that Frontier cancelled my flight has endangered my other flight to Europe the next day which is from San Francisco. The only other flight they had to offer me was on February 13th (3 days after my scheduled flight that was cancelled). I was reimbursed the flight value and received a voucher to fly with them another time. They are not reliable, the flight is not pleasant. Please consider all of these when you wish to fly with Frontier.",Detractor
" Frankfurt to Ho Chi Minh City via Beijing on A330-200 and B737, a super-promotional ticket for 1300 euro return. Everything was OK. Access to Air Canada's Lounge in Frankfurt granted with ease even I arrived 7 hours prior to departure. The cabins were all full. Good IFE, food, and amenity kit onboard. The Airport in Beijing is cumbersome and not recommended for beginners. In Beijing, I went to Air China First Class Lounge which is a good, spacious business class lounge (they have two identical lounges of which one for some strange reason is called First Class. Could not access their internet which always give me problems in China. The lounge have nice sleeper roomlets and the shower OK. All flights on time. Food and drinks were acceptable. FA-staff were hardworking and focused. They very polite though misunderstood most inquiries and requests. Excellent value for money. The last leg was on a small B737 and had only 2 rows in business class. Welcome champagne offered. Food just passable. Classic business class recliner seats were OK. No amenity pack given. No individual IFE and poor headsets. This leg can only score max 6 of 10 but the first leg scores 8 of 10. A solid product.",Passive

" I took this flight from Vancouver to San Diego with my husband and son on Dec 28th. The flight was scheduled from 8pm - 11pm. 7:30 PM - Upon arrival at the departure gate we were informed the plane was delayed for an unspecified period of time. 8:40 PM - We boarded 40 mins late. My family all had only carry on bags, which we quickly realized would not fit in the overhead compartments - along with a many other passengers. Our bags were taken from us to be placed under the plane, and would have to retrieved via the carousel in San Diego. It seemed odd that all the flight staff watched us board with bags they knew would not fit in the plane? The overhead compartments were broken and duct taped in several places on the plane. One gentlemen even remarked that he thought the front window of the plane was duct taped. 9:20 - Takeoff The plane seemed very old and in dire cosmetic disrepair. The flight staff were friendly. They mentioned that another crew was scheduled to work the flight we were on but were delayed so they were working on a 12 hour day. No snacks were offered, only water, coffee and juice. Staff was pleasant, in cabin entertainment was working. 11:40 - We approached San Diego to learn we had to divert to LAX due to fog. Everyone was obviously disappointed and also confused because it didn't appear foggy. Once in LA we sat in a deserted area of the airport hoping to be accepted for deplaning. Several announcements were made to try and appease our frustrations but the pilot himself seemed utterly defeated. He mentioned that he ""we shouldn't worry, because they were already assured we wouldn't have to return to Vancouver."" We were just sitting there on the tarmac waiting for something to happen. At one point there was supposed to be a bus coming to get us and staff to help accommodate our various scenarios. 1:30 AM - We were able to utilize a deplaning corridor (our plane was too small to fit against the tunnel opening, so we walked down the stairs of the plane and up into the terminal via a second set. Not a big deal but just fed the flames of frustration people were feeling.) We were encouraged that an Air Canada staffer would meet us at the luggage carousel to advise us of our compensation / options. We were also told the reason the plane didn't land in San Diego was because the in flight crew had worked 12 hours and wanted out of the air and didn't want to circle to wait to land. We checked the flight status at San Diego airport and it appeared all other flights were landing. 2:00 AM - Air Canada staffers advised those of us wishing to leave to submit car rental vouchers to Air Canada, those in need of boarding stayed back. I will try this but some other folks with previous experiences of this nature didn't seem hopeful that we would be reimbursed. I will remain hopeful. We rented a car for $100 from Avis. 4:00 AM - We arrived at Hotel in San Diego. My parents were to arrive in San Diego today to meet us on the same Air Canada flight 8 pm - 11pm. After our experience yesterday, I was very worried for them. Rightfully so, the flight was cancelled right at 8:00 PM ""no pilot"". I will never fly this airline again.",Detractor
"I gave AA a one star rating because I had to choose something. Otherwise, I would have given it a negative. This was my worst flying experience and my children's first flying experience. We were supposed to fly out Sunday morning at 7.45 am and due to a mechanical issue the flight was delayed (at first) and ended up getting cancelled. The next flight out was full, so we had to take the next available flight at 4.45. Spent all day at the airport waiting to start our Orlando vacation. I was thinking this would be the worst part of our trip - but it wasn't. On the way home - our flight was delayed yet again. We flew out 2 hours after our original flight was scheduled, which caused us to miss our connecting flight in Chicago. There were no later flights, so we had to stay overnight. When I asked them about a room, along with many other passengers, we were given a discounted rate at a hotel 15 miles from the airport. The discounted rate was $75 and they didn't offer to pay for a cab (the shuttle wasn't running this late). Rather than taking the room, we slept at the airport. Definitely not what you wish for your children's first flying experience.",Detractor
"My wife and I flew Iberia yesterday from Los Angeles to Madrid. We chose the airline for the convenience of it being a non stop flight. We were very pleased with every aspect of the flight. The aircraft was new and there was obvious pride on the part of the crew. They were friendly, accommodating and very professional. The leg room in economy class was adequate (I am 6'2""). The food was as good as airline food can be. We had the choice of chicken or pasta and we both chose chicken. The aircraft offered personal entertainment for each passenger with plenty of options. There was a unique feature of a camera mounted on the tail of the plane showing the take off and landing - nice touch. Finally, we arrived 20 minutes early and our luggage came out on the carousel in a timely fashion.",Promoter
"  Flew Emirates, Bangkok to Malta via Tunis. A tale of two contrasting legs: First leg Bangkok to Dubai fine on 777 or A380 depending on time of departure. New planes and the expected Emirates service/experience. 2nd leg from Dubai to Tunis left a lot to be desired - on a very tired, old 'workhorse' 777. Narrow width seats. Old generation ICE, no working power supply (at the time). 2hrs in Tunis - you are not allowed to disembark the aircraft and for the first hour are vigorously encouraged to remain in your seat while headcounts, security formalities are completed. Having just endured a 6-hr flight and probably a couple of hours in Dubai before the flight - and in need of a stretch, drink and to freshen up - it was frustrating not to receive better on-ground 'transit' care. Delayed outbound from DXB - TUN meant the flight took close to 20hrs all in all.",Passive

"The sad decline of our national flag carrier seems to be continuing unabated. I fly the LHR-PHX-LHR route on a monthly basis and although I've spoken to colleagues about changing carrier, as BA offers the only direct route into Phoenix I have stuck with them. But where to begin? The 747-400s used are ageing, shabby and tired, if they were your old horse they'd have been taken to the knacker's yard years ago. Throughout the aircraft the seating is uncomfortable, space cramped and onboard facilities lacking and limited. The AVOD in economy and the premium variant is restarted with almost comical regularity, the screens are smaller than most of us have fitted in our car so you are either squinting or just unable to see the movie you are trying to watch. When the person in front reclines the screen is almost forced into your face such is the limited legroom. Catering is just awful in the economy cabins and only marginally better in business, although I see the airline is getting around this now by allowing the the privilege of paying for a meal upgrade. One word of caution here - if you are upgraded your meal stays behind despite you paying for it. All in all BA is slipping against the competition and delays are common place as to be expected, LHR lounges are in need of a complete makeover and it's a rarity to get more than a couple of cabin staff who seem happy in their work. I've one more BA flight to go and then it's adieu from me, but then given how they so sparingly issue tier points now it's not like I'm going to miss them.",Detractor

" Warsaw to Copenhagen. The flight was delayed for 2 hours, when we talked with the guy at the gate, at the first announced time he told us, that we could go eat and come back at boarding time 19:30. My girlfriend and I sat down for a tea. I'm looking at the screen with departure times a couple of times, at 19:25 we are going to the gate which is announced on the screen. When we get to this gate, we are told that the gate was moved and closed, which we do not understand as the screens said something different and the guy at the gate as well told us â€œboarding starts at 19:30 at this gateâ€ We ran to the other gate, where we were told that this gate was to Hamburg - at this point I got frustrated. We were told to go to the LOT counter. The guy we talked with here was very rude and didn't seem like he wanted to help, after some minutes of discussion where he tried to tell us that we were dumb â€œdon't you know you have to go there 30 min before timeâ€ â€œdon't fall asleepâ€ - I even told him that we were drinking tea and looking at the screens. All of a sudden other lady came to the counter, she had the same story and was also frustrated. It was at this point the LOT employees realised that something was wrong. The guy we talked with went into the back room to talk with whom I assume to be of a higher rank. He came out and unwillingly changed our flights but again with a very rude attitude.

DTW-TTN-DTW. Outbound flight was delayed by weather 4+ hours. Not Frontier's fault but once onboard we were charged $1.99 for lukewarm coffee: is it expecting too much to get freebies after such a long delay? Apparently so. But my main gripe is their carry-on policy. It appears based on our experience both ways that after a certain number of passengers have boarded they simply assume the overheads are full and require people to pay extra to check their carry-ons. This happened to us and when we stopped arguing and got on board the overheads were nowhere near full. That's a $50 hit each way.,Detractor
"The food and service was outstanding staff delightful and polite. I think EVA's service is their strong point. Their weak point would be their seats which could double as a chiropractic device from the Middle Ages. As a 6"" tall man in the seated position the seat was perfect.

To compensate for this rather unpleasant sensation the cradle position of the seat is much more comfortable. The toilets were spotless. Taipei to Toronto the staff were exceptional.",Promoter

 Delhi to Singapore. The second time I flew on the A380. The ambiance inside the plane was spacious and great. The service was exceptional.

Another hitch was the on-line check-in where I was not able to choose the seat that I wanted as it was automatically chosen so I was put in an exit row which was a hassle for me as the TV monitor and the tray table has to be set up after take off only.

"  Orlando to Los Angeles. The service started out fine, in fact most of it was exceptional excluding a few delays in getting to my gate in time. I do have a few minor problems with how my flight went and the care given to my luggage though. The smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card, so if you're on a six hour flight with cash, make sure you eat before. They did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but that's all. Another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything, entertainment-wise and food-wise. Again, these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse, but the most important thing I mentioned was the care given to my luggage. Arriving at baggage claim, I found my suitcase scuffed and covered in black ink spots.

Seats on the A330 were comfortable enough, but having asked to move to some empty seats in the rear cabin and been refused, I later observed the cabin staff all stretched fast asleep for the majority of the flight in these very same seats. Their English language is restricted to basic service words, and don't try asking for something like ice or anything slightly off the standard patter - they just smile and walk away.

" My son and I flew direct, round trip from Seattle to Houston for a grand total of $400, including one checked bag and drinks. That is at least a couple hundred dollars less than any other airline. Here's what we paid for: Round trip tickets Seattle-Houston $153 each x 2 = $306. (That's extremely cheap) One checked bag ($35 each way) = $70 Two waters, one Coke, one beer (a nice IPA) = $16 Two Cokes, one tea (On the way back we brought food and snacks with us, plus I took two empty disposable plastic water bottles, and filled them up after security, which saved me $6) = $8. They have larger seats, which appear to be the same in the 1st class sections of the domestic carriers that you can reserve for $50 more, but you need to reserve them as soon as the seat reservations open because I assume they go fact. Both the check in crew and cabin crew were great. Personable, friendly, positive, and helpful. I recommend this airline to others, unless you have children, in which case probably no because: If you're traveling with children and you want to guarantee a seats next to each other, you have to pay extra for that. You have to pay for carry on bags. All those drinks add up. With kids, of course you have checked bags, which also cost. I decided not to pay for the additional (which was maybe $20) to guarantee that my son and I sat together. He's 13, and would have been fine with not sitting with me, but in fact we still had seats together both ways. All the costs are on their website, so run the numbers and compare it with the other airlines to see which makes more sense. I would definitely fly Spirit again, and in fact plan to use them when I spend a weekend visiting a friend in Las Vegas later in the year.

The stewardess said the 'stretch seats' had actually created the lack of leg room between other seats. Frontier should not have back seats that are so cramped and certainly shouldn't be charging full price for them. While giving the usual free beverages we found it very cheap and tacky that Frontier doesn't even give a bag of pretzels.

PRG-AUH-BKK and back in December and January 2014. As the leg from Prague to Abu Dhabi was served by Czech Airlines my comments refer only to the Etihad part. Abu Dhabi Airport needs to improve on signs and information monitors. I guess when switching planes within short time this will be a huge problem. On board the staff were friendly and caring except for the request to increase the temperature. The majority of the passengers were freezing sitting down covered with all available blankets and some even using their winter jackets! This happened on both flights. The food was OK just average airplane food. The entertainment system works well although the screen quality is poor. We usually prefer a long leg without the need for a stop in the middle of the trip so we are unlikely to be re-using this service.,Detractor

In Amsterdam May 12th trying to get my boarding pass for my connecting flight to Kilimanjaro Airport. No reservation. Next kiosk no reservation. Tried both the Delta and the KLM flight #'s. Found KLM rep who sent me down to transfers who then tried it for me typing in both KLM and Delta flight #'s. No reservation so sent me on to Transfer rep who eventually found me and sent me back to a kiosk for seat assignment. Return trip from Kilimanjaro to Amsterdam I previously paid for Economy Plus seat upgrade with confirmation printed in hand and also on my Iphone. My seat 10J was also sold to someone else who checked in just before me. No other windows for the 12.5 hour flight so he finally gave me a window seat farther back. What a way to do business!

" Chennai to Raipur via Hyderabad. Indigo is being quite careless these days, they mess up things and all we get to hear is ""sorry for the inconvenience mam"". Recently While booking the tickets i had selected a XL seat for my father according to his comfort and convenience and had paid for it in advance, but still indigo somehow managed to sell all the XL seats including my father's, so today when we went to get our boarding passes, they said sorry mam, all seats are full and then they made me go here and there but in the end all they said is, you will have to manage and we will try to refund your money. Its not about money but the inconvenience which my father had to go through. Why have a feature of prior booking the desired seats if you people can't handle it properly.",Passive

"  San Francisco to Paris via Keflavik. It was my worst flight experience ever. First of all, the price you see first, is no where near what you end up paying at the end. It was originally around $50), when I finished the booking it already went close to $900. They don't give water and you have to pay for anything. I had a tea for $4.5 They charge for carry on too so I didn't bring any carry on. The limit on luggage is only 20kg. I also purchased $50 for travel protection which I thought includes cancellation. Later I decided to go back sooner. On the website you can change the flight and first I saw I have to pay $100 for the change. It sounded ok to me after I put my card information I realized they'll charge me another $216 for fare difference. I hit the cancel button and even closed the browser but I already received the confirmation email about that. So I tried to contact them to cancel the change and was on call with them for an hour or so. They said they are happy to change my flight to the original thing but they won't refund me. Then I tried to cancel the flight but they say they'll refund me around $80 only. They said travel protection is for medical emergency only.

My husband and I just returned from a trip to Costa Rica where we flew on Spirit for the first time. I should have had the first clue when they charged for carry-on luggage! When we started on our trip we couldn't believe that they charged for everything including water! On a 4 hour flight! Then to continue the abuse they didn't have pillows or blankets even for purchase so I was freezing for 4 hours and bought 2 blankets during our layover to continue on to Costa Rica. Then on our return trip from Costa Rica they charged us another $25 because we were supposedly over-weight on our luggage. They weighed a total of 91 pounds for 2 suitcases which was the same as when we left LAX since we really didn't buy much. Usually international flights allow 50 pounds! They wouldn't allow water or drinks on the plane even when purchased in the airport after we had been through security so they checked our carry on luggage again right before we boarded at the gate. This is obviously an effort to force you to buy on the plane. Needless to say this was our first and will be our last flight on Spirit Airlines.,Detractor
March 7 and 23 YYZ to SJO return AC1806/1806. I will never use Air Canada Rouge again. The 29-inch seat pitch is the lowest in North America with the exception of Spirit Airlines.

Overall a terrible experience. Two months before the flight I requested a bassinet for my daughter and asked Swiss to reserve seats for us close to bassinet. When I got onboard I found our seats far away from bassinet. We needed to ask people sitting in front to change their seats with ours. Additionally the cabin crew were very rude. When I requested a toy for my daughter the hostess reacted with an angry tone and said 'do not you see I am busy?'. She continued to show the same disrespectful behaviours during the flight.

"Kuala Lumpur to New York JFK via Kuwait. My thoughts on Kuwait Airways are pretty mixed. The cheapest flight available from Kuala Lumpur to JFK (about $390 one way) which is a big pro in my opinion but it also explains why the airline sucks in so many other ways - staff were friendly, we missed the connection in Kuwait and were put in decent hotel for the night. However, no working in flight entertainment on either of the flights, very little leg room (though one flight was rather empty and I could lie down). Since my connection to JFK was missed and I had to fly the next day, I missed by bus connection to Pittsburgh from JFK. Kuwait Airways would not even consider reimbursing, even though the flight was a day late and the bus fee was minimal. Give yourself at least a day in between your ETA and your next flight if you are using a different airline for your next flight, or else you will be screwed and Kuwait Airways won't help. You'll also lose any money you thought you were saving from going with this cheap airline.",Detractor
"Two internal flights with Air China: Chengdu to Guilin and Xian to Beijing. Not impressed with their safety at all compared with other domestic carriers (Shanghai Airlines and Capital Airlines which were much more professional). Crew did not check safety measures appropriately: a passenger sitting next to me was using his mobile before take off and it took 3 crew members instructions before he finally switched it off - but they failed to tell him to put his bag in the overhead locker. The bag was on his lap disguising the fact that he was not wearing his seat belt. I asked him to put his seat belt on and his comment was ""relax"". Same thing happened on landing - they didn't check his seat belt. A friend who was seated in a bulkhead seat said a bag was in front of her on the floor during take off and landing. I had to completely unpack my case at check in because the scanner at check in had identified something (it was the plug of my travel kettle!). Check in staff were most unhelpful and officious.

Having flown international business class many times on several airlines this trip can only be rated as the worst experience my wife and I have had in either economy class or business class.

The white wine I was served after takeoff was warm the lamb I ordered for my meal was overcooked and almost inedible the entertainment system was awkward to use and no instructions on how to use it were supplied.

"  Charlotte to South Bend. Flight left on time. Although advertised as allowing a carry on bag, there was an effort to get folks to check bags at the gate. Question, if it is allowed, why do they need to be checked - if the plane is small, allow free bag check before getting to the gate. Based upon the way the industry is geared, it seems that the best thing to do is always take the bag with you and allow it to be checked at the gate for no cost. In order to check a bag it required the removal of any medication, batteries, personal items, etc, the items one specifically packs into a carry on bag because they want to have it when they land. Also the cost for the seat (booked last minute) was extremely high (>1000) for a flight of approx. 2 hours. The service on the plane was good.

" Rio de Janeiro to London via Casablanca, We were supposed to fly out of Rio on Friday 20th. Once we were all checked in we went to the gate only to be told that there would be a 30 minute delay. This 30 minute delay turned into 90 minutes, with the airline finally cancelling the flight. The transportation from the airport to the hotel was a shamble. So people like us opted just to take a cab to the suggested hotel. Once there we discover after waiting for an hour that they did not have enough rooms for everyone. So we took a second cab to the next suggested hotel. We got a room there. The following day evening was picked up by coach and we were told that our flight would be at 6pm. Again, all checked in, went to the gate and they repeated the same as the night before, cancelled our flight. Why bring everyone to the airport only to cancel their flight again. Everyone was clearly and justifiably annoyed. They had hardly any staff and no sense of direction. When asked if we would be refunded our money if we book with another airline we could not get a clear answer from them. The second nights hotel was awful, some nasty place in town. We still have no idea if we will be flying today or not. This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. RAM does not have a office, a desk or even any representatives in Rio.

No particular attention to passengers asking about drinks, and serving wasn't good - food served with foil cover labeled ""remove before serving"", etc. I felt like I was in economy premium, rather than business. What mattered was the lie flat and the ability to sleep, but at this price, even for a discounted upgrade, it's not worth it.",Passive
I have become a big Fan of Finnair. DUS-BKK in J for 1250 Euros is an extremely good price and they offer those for almost all their Asia-Flights. The new Seat (Full Flat) is amazing. We had the old Seat on the Way back. Good enough and AY are losing those Seat mostly in 2014. Food ist good - I like the signature Soup. It's a nice touch. Crew - as on every Euro-Airlines. So and So. But mostly friendly older Ladies. Overall for the Prices offered the best Choice in Oneworld. I found the IFE to be better than I read here. Although its surely not a System like Qatar's or Emirates. Big Plus: The Stress-Free Airport. Small nice connecting in Helsinki is bliss. I will most definitely fly with Finnair again just booked a very cheap Flight to NRT.,Promoter

" Bhubaneshwar to Mumbai. IndiGo, being a low-cost no-frills airline is a value for money indeed. Although their in-flight menu is bit expensive, one can bring their food from home also, which also save some money. From ground handling to the crews' services, it was an excellent service. The students fare scheme is a boon indeed. Being a student, I always prefer this airlines as they offer not only 6% basic fare discount but also 10 kg free baggage allowance. I also prefer this airlines as they are the most punctual airlines. Looking forward to travel on IndiGo.",Promoter
"Flew Emirates for the 4th time and the in-flight experience keeps on getting better and better! After flying thrice on-board Emirates between the KHI-DXB sector in the past my recent trip with the same airline consisted of two sectors: KHI-DXB-IST (EK601 & EK123) and IST-DXB-KHI (EK 122 & EK600). Aircraft's were their B777-300(ER) which I love although some people might find the 3-4-3 configuration to be a little cramped. The B777-300(ER) aircraft's operated on the two flights during my inbound journey (A6-ENO and A6-ENI) were some of the latest in the fleet and their seats were equipped with the all new ICE Digital Screen which consists of a 12"" IFE Touchscreen and a touch-enabled remote control.

If I tell my customers that I deliver late because my subcontractor delivered late - I can do that once. The second time my customer doesn't care.

"  Cancun â€“ Shannon via Newark: Booked with United as they offered the most convenient connections back to Ireland. Check in at Cancun was self check in with a bag drop. There were no queues at the United desks which made for a pleasant experience. Boarding was organised into groups which was convenient for me as I was in group 2. The flight was uneventful and on time, leg room was a little on the tight side, I used the Direct TV which had a large offering of videos and TV stations for a fee. United only serve a small snack and drink on the flight for free and pay for sandwiches and alcoholic drinks. Transit in Newark was quick for immigration but very slow for TSA, but I had plenty of time. Flight to Ireland was a better experience with good leg room, choice of movies on demand and a good quality meal which consisted of a starter and main course, followed by an Ice cream and bottle of water as a separate serving, which was a nice touch. The flight had turbulence mid way over the Atlantic, but the Captain kept us well informed and ascended throughout the flight to avoid as much of the turbulence as possible. Crew were very friendly, helpful and professional throughout the flight. Landed ahead of time in Shannon, Captain even met the passengers on the airbridge and thanked us for flying with them, a very nice touch. Overall United offer a good experience especially on the transatlantic sector and fantastic route connections in Newark.",Promoter

"I had flown Spirit one other time on business travel and had an unbelievably bad experience, but decided to try one more time on leisure travel when my schedule wasn't as tight. This experience was worse than the first. You will be charged for carry-on, for checked baggage, for choosing a seat (any seat, even a middle seat at the back of the plane incurs an additional charge). You will be asked if you want to pay extra to board early, and then, incredibly, you'll be asked if you want to ""contribute"" extra money for them to purchase green napkins. Our flight was delayed 2 hours. We stood in line for more than an hour to drop off one checked despite having checked in online. Our flight disappeared from all airport monitors entirely so we had no idea if it had been delayed further or cancelled altogether. The attitude of the gate agent summed it all up when she said, ""If I have to charge you for your small carry-on, please don't yell at me. I'm just doing my job"".heir own employees seem to sense how bad the customers have it. You are unlikely to save money with all their nickel-and-diming, you are likely to be delayed, and you are nearly certain to feel like you got even less than what you paid for in terms of value.",Detractor
"  London Heathrow to Edinburgh return, possibly my last BA flights. I used economy (or maybe should be re named) economy minus outbound and returned in Club Europe, checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at T5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk. Security quick I'm a BA/Oneworld sapphire member so used the North lounge which was okay. Flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late. A320, seat 11A an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board. Return check in quick as was security, the BA lounge in EDI has been the same for a few years now. It's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff. Boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late. Club Europe on domestic flights is a new introduction. Actually it replaced what was BA economy class. A cynical ploy by the BA board to extract more money out of its loyal customers? The aircraft was pretty full so some people like BA although I suspect many passengers were transferring at LHR. Service was okay food economy standard although included in the price. Arrival at T5 around 30 min late 10 min for bags. I fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights. I have supported BA in the past although I've not used them long haul for about 17 months. Basically they are not good enough. Cut backs and poor service is evident. I expect security comfort and some service when paying Â£2500+ for a business class ticket. Qatar, Cathay and even SriLankan offer better service. On reflection I fly business class on most flights so I don't actually need any frequent flyer status. The cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits. I might fly BA in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles I've earned. But my loyalty will be my wallet in future. Bye BA.",Detractor

QF98 Hong Kong to Brisbane (Overnight Flight). This flight left around 20 minutes later than it should due to airport issues. Captain kept everyone fully informed which was good. Flight crew provided prompt and excellent service which given it was an overnight flight was very good. Meal served after 40 minutes in the air giving passengers around 7 hours sleep. Aircraft was only half full so pretty much everyone had a spare seat next to them so they could stretch out a bit. I managed to get around 6 hours sleep in which is pretty good for me in economy as I'm tall (having the extra space really helped). Food was very good although the breakfast pastry was bland. IFE was totally pathetic IFE Screen only 10cm in size and the current selection of movies and music was simply appalling. You get much better IFE on domestic flights so lift your game Qantas. Aircraft seat got pretty hard after 9 hours flying and the aircraft is looking old needs to be revamped shortly. We all got through Brisbane Immigration quite quickly only to be held up for ages waiting for baggage to come through this is another area that needs improving upon in Brisbane.,Passive

My only real problem was flying back, the ignorant middle aged male passenger directly in front of me, immediately reclined his seat after take off, although there is very little room. I am 5 ft 10, and have limited mobility and so was very uncomfortable for 5 and a half hours.

Good operation at LHR to board the aircraft.

 Cancun to Columbus via Ft Lauderdale. Absolute worst flying experience ever. The flight was 2.5 hours behind our first leg from Cancun to Ft lauderdale. This caused us to miss our connecting flight. Not only did they refuse to help passengers but they told us it would be more than 48 hours to get us on another flight leaving us stranded in Florida. They did not help board stranded customers when one customer asked what they were supposed to do the response from the spirit employee was â€œ it's not our concernâ€. We asked for a refund of our missed flight and booked with another carrier (southwest) and had to eat an additional $850 just to return home. Way to almost ruin a great trip.

"  London to Istanbul. I am ever increasingly disappointed with British Airways, the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited. The seats, lounge food, aircraft cleanliness, on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines. My most recent flight back I took an aisle seat for a change. The flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets. This is really quite irritating especially during meal service. No attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints. I find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight someone had left chewing gum on the seat as well. I think BA don't care, on the flight from Istanbul, electronic devices are banned, other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you. British Airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment, or even extra magazines on the flight. They really don't appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class.",Detractor

"  Rome to Lisbon via Faro. I have had to fly TAP often because my family and I visit my parents in Albufeira, and from Rome they practically have a monopoly (along with Alitalia) on flights to Faro. In all the years that we have flown, we have always had problems (delays, confusion, rude staff, etc.). Yet, never as bad as this time. The flight from Rome to Lisbon arrived late, and because of this we (family of four â€“ two minors) miss our connecting flight (always TAP) to Faro. After a chaotic experience in Lisbon airport we were told by TAP personnel that notwithstanding the late hour, TAP is unable to help us find somewhere to stay that night, and that the next TAP flight available is going to make us arrive in Faro some 15 hours after we were meant to! But the TAP personnel did say that we would be reimbursed for our overnight expenses to the tune of about 90 EURO each. To do this we must follow a procedure which they described. Though with difficulty we managed to find somewhere to stay, and followed their procedures exactly as told. Our delay of course created a number of personal problems, but that is to be expected with a 15 hour delay to a 45 minutes flight which leaves numerous times every day - such a long delay is completely unexpected. Anyway, four months after the fact I received an email stating that they won't reimburse us because ""we don't qualify"" for compensation. So, my conclusion is: I will never fly TAP again as they clearly don't respect their passengers, and I strongly recommend others to look for alternatives.",Detractor
"Medina to London via Amman. Royal Jordanian Airline is the worst airline I have ever used. The staff - as we walked in to the plane we were told you can sit wherever you would like, this meant that giving us designated seats was completely useless as people were searching for new seats because other people had taken their own. But the most shocking part was when the plane had decided to take off when they had not even allocated a couple and their 7 month old baby seats yet who were still standing in the isle. After getting off at Amman, the staff were even more disorganised - we landed at 1.45am and waited for transfer until 6am in the morning, to be taken to a hotel for only 2 hours and then bought back to the airport for our flight at 12pm. When we asked staff why it takes so long to sort out transfer, the airline had said it was the driver taking too long or we didn't have our transit forms completed.

BRU-CPH. Economy flex. Brussels airlines operates this route as a duopoly with SAS and it shows in the fares that are charged. My travel plans depended on the weather forecast in Denmark so I was only able to book 72 hours in advance. The cheaper of the two economy cabins had sold out on all 3 flights. The flexible ticket cost about 3 times the advertised minimum fare. Despite this I was charged 8 euros for paying with a credit card (none of my debit cards were accepted by the airline's web site). The ticket allowed fast track security although as this lane was merged into others there was no advantage. Extra cabin baggage was also allowed but as the ground staff did not enforce the cabin baggage policy this was again no advantage. The flight left 20 minutes late as the handling agent had not loaded the bags in time. The seat had no head rest and felt like it had almost no padding a bit like resting on a leather covered ironing board. There was no magazine in the seat pocket. The advertised free light meal/snack was a bread roll with two slices of cheese with terrible coffee served in a small paper cup. The stewardess even had the nerve to tell me to enjoy my meal as she handed me the bread roll. In my opinion this airline provides budget service at legacy carrier prices.,Detractor

I have never been so cramped on a plane - I'm only 5'5"" and my knees touched the back of the next chair when it was reclined - I couldn't lift my purse from under the seat in front (and bags bigger then a purse will not fit under the seat).

There are no movies unless you purchase a tablet for $10. We didn't try any of the purchased food so can't comment about it. Added to all this - originally we booked a 2 hour layover back from Mexico in Toronto to have time make it through customs and having to go through security again before connecting flights (sadly happens at TO airport)- our ""itinerary"" change to a rouge flight lowered this to not much more than an hour.

"  London to Singapore via Beijing. There was no personal TV from Singapore to Beijing (such rarity for long haul). Food was really bland, 3 hours delay. Baggage delay, this is the funniest part, as if being delayed myself wasn't enough, my baggage didn't come on the same flight, it came the next day, 13 hours later. On a side note, Air China lounge is really terrible too. The only good thing that happen were the cabin staff who were nice and I am sure if given better facilities and opportunities, can deliver a better experience.

"SUB-KUL-HKT-CNX-KUL-SUB. SUB-KUL flight was pushed an hour early to 5.40am due to airport being overcrowded on Eidl Fitr holiday which was somewhat understandable. Having printed our boarding passes we still had to line up at the check in counter to pay airport tax. Once we arrived in KL we were ushered through the flight transfer area where staff informed us of our next departure gate and we had a pleasant 3 hour transit at the LCCT. Flights to and within Thailand were pleasant and punctual. Evening flight from Phuket to Chiang Mai they ran out of food by the time the crew got to our seats so we had instant noodles instead. In Chiang Mai we had to line up at the check in counter again to get a stamp in order to pass through the security check. We were rudely denied entry into the flight transfer area in KL on the way back to Surabaya because ""the flights were booked under different booking codes"". Note that there is no way to book AK and QZ flights under single purchase on the airline website and when we inquired the staff she mumbled something about ""not paying a transfer fee"" and us getting past the transfer hall last week was not meant to be part of procedure. We took our case to an immigration officer who accompanied us back to the transfer staff but turns out the immigration had to comply to airline policies. Begrudgingly we lined up at the long immigration lines to have our passports stamped entered the departure hall and lined up at the immigration again to find out that our flight was delayed 30 minutes.

After going through airport security twice, when you go to the gate you go through another security check. After that, some people were sitting behind the boarding desk while we were waiting for the plane as there weren't enough seats and the crew was pretty pissed about it even though they initially didn't say anything about them being there. Once boarded, everything was smooth again. I love the new Turkish in-flight safety video. There were a couple of new movies that I watched on the IFE system. They still have random episodes of TV Series which is interesting. The food was better than usual, with ground beef stuffed eggplant, rice and tzatziki sauce.

"The price was right, $300 round trip Boston to Copenhagen via Iceland but quite often you get exactly what you pay for.

"Flew Qantas business class by points upgrade from Perth to Auckland. The first disappointment was that Qantas used an A330 with the old style business class seats which was a questionable decision since you would think for passenger comfort on an overnight 6 hour flight they would use the newer style lie flat seats. The old style seats were just bigger and had more recline. Qantas really needs to improve on the standard of the their food especially in business. I had a crumbed snapper fillet which was barely better than the supermarket crumbed fish. The salads on the side were almost inedible. The breakfast service was canceled before the captain kept on saying more turbulence is expected, although there were only a few minutes of moderate to heavy turbulence. although I guess this isn't the pilot's fault as safety was still the first priority. Overall I would recommend that it was not worth paying for business class in cash, but if it's a point upgrades I may still be worth it for you.",Passive

My wife and I travelled 4 sectors in Cathay Business Class recently (CX110/CX261?CX260/CX139). We have a benchmark from travelling frequently with Qantas in Business. Several major aspects warrant comment. My wife is diabetic which was nominated at the time of booking. On one long overnight sector she asked for a light snack as she had to take medication. The staff member disregarded the request and offered no snack. However on the return long overnight sector a staff member when asked offered that a special snack had been loaded and was most obliging. What an inconsistency in the attitude of cabin staff. There appears to be no small snacks available at any time as is the case with competitors. Seat allocation. Was arranged at the time of booking which was some six months prior to departure. Boarding passes were issued at Sydney for the two sectors. Upon presentation at Hong Kong we were informed of a problem i.e the seat was broken and would not recline thus was unusable. We were asked to go to one side whereon we asked for a supervisor. Apparently our adjoining seats were not possible as one seat was broken (by coincidence the frequent flyer award seat). As the flight was almost fully booked we were allocated seats apart five and six rows behind. As it was nearly midnight we had little alternative. Upon boarding we overheard a passenger seating next to my wife who wished to be repositioned nearer his friend. We were able to sort this out and then inform cabin staff. Sometime later (there was an hour and a half delay before takeoff due to weather conditions) we noticed the original seat was occupied and was fully reclined. This seat was the frequent flyer seat.,Detractor
"Late evening departure on BA28 from Hong Kong to Heathrow, plane fully booked (pre-Christmas season) in all classes. My seat was 2K, the senior male purser presented himself and addressed me with my Christian name - I did not object, had the impression that this is part of a nice intimate atmosphere. During the flight I found out that the majority of the 14 pax in First class preferred a more formal approach and were addressed with their family names. The purser offered the champagne welcome drink and I gladly accepted, and soon my face turned pale : the champagne was almost as warm as a cup of tea. His apology came prompt, but too late. They simply had no cool drinks on board and needed about an hour - or 30 minutes after takeoff - to have the respective drinks at the right temperature level. British Airways did not control this service process properly. Maybe nobody was in charge, maybe it was simply forgotten. The plane had arrived in Hong Kong about 5 hours earlier, so there was enough time to take care of the quality of beverages. The remaining flight was ok - cordial hosts in the predominantly male service team, food not sensational, but it was after midnight, so no complaints in this respect. Seat was fine, had a nice sleep during the 12.5 hour flight, breakfast options okay, arrival ahead of schedule. So is there a reason to complain and to give rather low marks? Yes, we are talking about first class in a leading European airline. The product has to be perfect, that's part of the game in first. Serious irregularities result in harsh reaction of the customer. For me this means that it was most probably my last long distance flight on BA. No marks on inflight entertainment because I chose the sleep option.",Detractor

" Berlin to Hong Kong via Copenhagen / Stockholm. I was flying economy and was able to get an update at the gate for premium economy for a really good deal. The downside was that i have paid for my seat in economy and I didn't get any compensation for that. I have flown SAS before, in premium economy as well and I must say, the overall impression is the same. They don't excel in anything, I don't remember a part of the journey that made me say ""wow"" but also they aren't bad in anything. You get a relatively okayish experience for an okayish amount of money. The new things in premium economy this time were: free Wifi on board and the possibility of using the lounge at ARN. About the lounge in review separately. The inconvenience here was that making the upgrade at the gate, I had to go back through passport control, walk some good steps and then go back through passport and security control to get back to the gate. I ended up 15 minutes in the lounge. And also, I had to ask them at the gate if I was able to use the lounge, they didn't tell me when I did the upgrade. Because it was new, I had to see it. The seat I got was indeed huge, although not as comfortable as expected. I was alone on the whole row and the cabin, even with so many upgrades was still empty. The food was average, not what you would expect from a premium cabin and the service was in the same line. I couldn't log in automatically with my e-ticket number so I had to ask the crew to provide me a voucher in order to access the Wifi. It was unlimited, but I couldn't browse the internet, it worked just for social apps, so it was a nice plus, anyway. The seats had plugs for charging devices. The flights were almost all on time, only when coming back the delay made it impossible to make my 30 minutes connections, but I was rescheduled and got in TXL at the same time.

We flew paid business class fares in Delta's Business Elite LAX to SYD and SYD to LAX in the forward B/E cabin on Delta's 777-200LR. We checked in using the kiosks in Delta's terminal and went through security quickly (we are both Global Entry/Precheck). The Delta SkyClub at LAX which doubles as Delta's business class lounge was crowded noisy and inferior in all respects to the business class lounges operated by other carriers to Australia we've flown on (ANZ and QF). For what it's worth Delta uses the ANZ business class lounge in Sydney and in all respects it's superior to Delta's SkyClub. The flight was delayed. Despite Delta's explanations the real reason for the constant late departures is that Sydney's airport operates under a curfew. It's the same problem coming back to LAX as ICE/Customs don't start clearing baggage/passengers until 8am - resulting in people sitting on the plane for a fair amount of time following arrival. Once in the air the flight itself was OK. The Delta flatbed seat on the 777-200 is adequate but inferior to the seats on ANZ's 777 and the QF A380 - both of those airlines provide business class passengers with a mattress that is laid over the top of the seat when reclined. The meal service both directions was in all respects inferior to business class meal services on ANZ QF and CX. The portions are tiny and the food itself is mediocre. The cabin crew LAX to SYD was OK but the crew returning SYD- LAX was disorganized distracted and not terribly personable. Delta's AVOD system on its 777 aircraft is antiquated. The pop-out monitors will not stay upright - many passengers around us had this problem. The moving map and flight information displays need to be updated. The headphones provided by Delta are supposed to be noise cancelling but don't work well (we both use Bose Quiet Comfort 15 headphones so it really didn't matter). Given the cost of business class tickets and all things being equal the only thing Delta has going for it on its 777 service to/from SYD is the privacy and relative quiet of its herringbone seating arrangement. Otherwise based on any other criteria you choose to use Delta's product is inferior compared to the other carriers we have flown on to/from Australia and New Zealand (ANZ QF and CX). We can't recommend Delta for business class to/from Sydney.,Detractor

"Minatitlan to Morelia via Mexico City. I've flown with Aeromexico around 10 times for the last 30 days. This airline is usually the most expensive option in Mexico, but this time to my surprise it was the cheapest for most of the routes I travelled. They used to be a most punctual airline (it was even their slogan for years). Well, that's all in the past. 8 out of 10 flights were delayed. The minimum delay was 30 minutes and there I went to almost 5 hours (for one hour flights!). Their apology always came with the same excuse: Mexico City's airport is overcrowded, and its control tower keeps asking us to delay our flights. I would believe this if other airlines had the same problem. They don't. Flights going from the same airports to Mexico City, at the same time but with other airlines, were all on time, which of course was even more frustrating. Their planes are old in many cases, and all you get on board is 100 grams of salted peanuts and a small glass of Coke. If you have the chance to take another airline, take it.",Passive
"Another excellent experience with BA. Very fast check in at Glasgow for Exec Club status holders (prioritised over a large queue) and the quickest security I've had at an airport.

Priority boarding was honoured and had row 1 seating on this former BMI A319. Good welcome by staff and adequate legroom. First Officer was informative and we took off ahead of schedule. For a 1 hour flight the crew provided a good service of snacks (crisps and biscuits) and a full bar excluding champagne (no CE service on domestic routes).

"  I fly EasyJet weekly between London and Budapest so have accumulated a representative view of their service on this route, and tonight's flight from Budapest to London is not unusual. It's cheap, they fly to Gatwick, planes are new and crew professional and friendly. The flights are almost always late, due to ground handling issues. Twice this week, I have been delayed (1 hour tonight, 2.5 hours Monday) due to the water not being cleared and replaced on the aircraft when it should. On Monday this resulted in me getting to my apartment 3 hours late at 1am. Tonight this resulted in passengers flushing the toilets manually using bottles of mineral water provided by the crew and using a hand sanitiser to ""wash"" hands. For the second time this week, there was also no hot or cold food. Tonight, not for the first time, we were then dropped at the South Terminal at Gatwick rather than the North as scheduled, leaving people to find their way to their cars, taxis or friends at the other terminal. I have now reached the point where if I have a choice of airline on a route, I will choose another than EasyJet, even if it costs substantially more. I used to be a fan of EasyJet, but having become a regular flyer with them over the last year, I can no longer recommend them.",Detractor

Toilets were clean on both flights and the seats look brilliant but 2 hours into the flight you can clearly see the poor padding. I also couldn't get to sleep on the night flight. Overall Air Asia is ok but I would prefer Qantas or Virgin.,Passive
"Sydney to Paris via Hong Kong return. I wish to compliment Cathay Pacific staff inflight and the ground staff on my trip. I found them to be most courteous, helpful and friendly.

The cost of the ticket was competitive but it was the staff who impressed me the most and I will fly again with Cathay Pacific.",Promoter
"  Gatwick to San Francisco via Keflavik. The flight was delayed, the staff was rude and disorganized throughout the boarding process and to top it off they made me pay $99 for my carry on. Their allowance for baggage, including transatlantic flights to the US is extremely small. Basically you can take a small backpack or a laptop bag. That's it. I've flown all over the world with that bag with countless airlines. The charge is exorbitant and I felt totally taken advantage of in the way it was handled by the crew. Never again",Detractor

Then they hand you a â€œwe are sorry for the inconvience so here's a big $10 food voucher to use in airportâ€ really, $10? What can you buy at a airport for $10? Nobody with this company cares about the customer. I only wish I would have read the reviews before booking. Pay attention, do something, it starts at the top! Employees spend all day apologizing to upset travelers, is that what they signed up for? Do you care about them? Travelers, stay away, don't do it, spend a little more.

"Positively surprised by EVA Air, the staff was very kind on both flights. Food was very good, had gluten free, it was really delicious. Entertainment was very good, newest releases available and lots of other options as well. I would recommend it definitely to everyone. The economy class seats are not that comfortable. Surprisingly the flight arrived back 45 minutes early. The flight to Bangkok was delayed 1.5 hours but we were not given an explanations, which is annoying on a night flight when people are already tired.",Promoter
Sydney-Beijing-Paris then Rome-Beijing to Sydney for a family holiday. That's four 12hr flights. As others have said price is the only advantage of this airline ($1500 AUD return to Europe from Australia during new year). The plane's facilities were poorly maintained (seat cushions slip at awkward angles TV screen falling apart or not working poor selection of entertainment toilets unkempt and food that was difficult to stomach). However it was mainly the other passengers that made it worse - yelling clearing their throats loudly rude to staff jamming their seats up and down violently and worst of all leaving the toilets a mess. Perhaps a single 12hr flight would have been tolerable but 2 of them in a row was insufferable.,Detractor
"I would never willingly book a flight on Air France again. I have travelled with Air France from Paris to Abu Dhabi in August and from Paris to Johannesburg in September 2013. To Abu Dhabi I specifically booked Etihad only to discover that they are doing a codeshare with Air France. Luckily Etihad have a number of rows specifically for Etihad customers and so I was comfortable to and from Abu Dhabi but the Air France staff were terrible. I even heard the Air France Purser ask an Etihad crew member what they should do to work together well and the Etihad crew member replied ""do things the way we want you to and we'll have no problem"". The flight to Johannesburg was on Air France as my husband wanted to go on a direct flight - even he who travels transatlantic monthly was horrified. Air France have the cheek to email you the day before the flight offering you an upgrade. The first email was for 189 Euros when we tried booking it no joy - when we tried at the airport they said we could upgrade for 489. On the return from Johannesburg the upgrade was offered at 289 Euros still no joy on the internet and at the airport they didn't even understand what I was talking about. Never again.",Detractor

This was my third trip to the Philippines and had used two other airlines before and had delays, my trip with China Eastern went great with no delays, baggage was auto transfered, movie section good and flight attendants were very pleasant.

I flew LGW-IST-DAC and was rather surprised by the quality of Turkish Airlines. On my first flight I flew on a Boeing 737-800. Staff were polite and food was pretty good very happy that it was halal. Istanbul to Dhaka I flew on an Airbus A330-200 . Plane was clean standards were acceptable. They gave us all sorts of things like toothbrushes blindfolds and slippers etc for maximum comfort and gave the kids a Rubiks Cube and a blow up Turkish Airlines plane.

"  London Heathrow to Jakarta. Priority check in was excellent as was the fast track pass through security. Garuda do not have their own dedicated lounge at LHR and I was directed to the Number 1 traveller lounge which was a disappointment. Very busy, it was impossible to obtain a table in the dining area and I managed to eventually find an empty seat in the lounge area. Leaving this to go to the bar to obtain a drink, my seat had been taken when I returned! Once on board the aircraft, the service was superb. Pre boarded and greeted by my name, I was shown to my seat (6K) and offered Champage and hot towel. My order was taken for post take off drinks and the In flight meal. After take off the drink was served promptly and courteously and I was again addressed by my name. Dinner consisted of a choice of 4 appetizers,4 main courses, cheese and biscuits and a choice of 2 desserts and each course was served separately. A selection of Champagne, 3 white wines, 3 red wines and a desert wine complimented the meal, although this aspect of the service was a little slower and the crew seemed suprised that I wanted white wine with the appetizer and then change to red wine with the main course. The seat was particularly comfortable and had direct aisle access (1-2-1 configuration) despite being a window seat. Following a good night's sleep, I enjoyed a pleasant breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurt and cereals followed by a choice from 3 dishes on the main course. In addition, hot and cold snacks were available on demand during the flight plus a selection of tea and coffee. The crew were discreet but attentive throughout and made the journey a real pleasure. The flight was punctual and it didn't feel as though I'd spent 14 hours on board. Overall, very impressed. Thoroughly enjoyed the flight but I'd like to see Garuda use a different lounge at LHR.",Promoter

Returned to using Thai this year after a 3 year gap. Travelled LHR - BKK in January returning in February. My return was sealed by Thai Airways new baggage allowance policy of 30kg and a switch back to newly refurbished 747s. As a scuba diver this means I can now carry all my kit without going via the middle east. At check in on the way out I was asked if I was satisfied with my selected seat. I was offered the alternative of an exit row with greater leg room. I took this and found I was the only person in the whole row which was good as these seats are slightly narrower than normal. I therefore had room to move my elbows to eat! On the return journey I was again offered an alternative to the seat I had reserved another aisle seat but with an empty place beside me great. Good leg room and if it wasn't for other passengers selfishly punching the touch screens and bouncing in the seat in front it would have been perfect. I cannot blame Thai for other passengers behaviour but maybe a note saying these are touch screens not punch bags would help!,Promoter

Economy SIN-DOH-ATH 9 May and VIE-DOH-SIN 16 May. Boarding at Singapore on time and flight departed slightly behind schedule. The seats on the B787 were a bit cramped and not the most comfortable. Entertainment system was good and meal service was prompt. Very good snack sandwiches and main meals. Transfer at Doha was seamless - upon disembarking I could clear the transit security within 10 minutes. Flight to Athens on an older A330-300 entertainment system a bit dated food was good and service was ok. Seat was very good though. Departed Doha behind schedule and arrived in Athens around 10 minutes late but bags were on the belt within 20 minutes of disembarking the aircraft. Return from Vienna was good - check-in was fast and boarding took around 20 minutes although it was a bit disorganised. Vienna-Doha flight was operated by the B787 once again seats and entertainment was ok. The veg meal I got on this flight was pretty good and crew were very professional. Had the privilege to fly on the A350 from Doha to Singapore and the aircraft was a step up from the B787. Seats had more pitch/width and the earphone and USB ports are now integrated into the screen the entertainment system worked perfectly. Flight on this sector was not full but the service was the best of the lot. Cabin crew went around on several drink and snack services and the main breakfast meal on this sector was good. Arrival in Singapore on time and bags were on the belt within 20 minutes. It was a good experience with Qatar Airways and I look forward to flying more of the A350 in future.,Promoter
It is a low-cost airline. You should not expect much. It was my first time taking a flight that was free seating. Pick whatever is available as soon as you get on board. Our flight was Dubai-Budapest-Dubai. On our BUD-DWC flight they intentionally left our hold luggage in BUD. It was not lost they just bumped it off intentionally because they needed to load more fuel. Our baggage arrived after 2 days and it was very inconvenient because we had to go back to the airport to pick it up and I live 150kms away from the airport! No in-flight entertainment and you have to buy your food. It was not a bad experience at all other than the baggage incident.,Passive
"Tokyo to Vienna via Beijing. A321 plane from Haneda seems to have a new business class seat with personal inflight entertainment system. Seat comfortable for regional flight with very good seat pitch. Service and food all very good. A330 seat is very comfortable for sleeping and good service. Meal on the Beijing to Vienna flight was not the best you can get in the sky but still good. I communicated in Chinese with the crew so I can not comment on their English speaking skills. English spoken movie selection is very limited, it is mostly Chinese films with English subtitles. Breakfast was served more than 2 hours before landing, which I thought to be too early. There is fixed Chinese or western breakfast menu, you can't choose individual items. Spinach omelete was nice. There is no premium line at Beijing airport and the queues can get a bit long. This was my first time flying Air China long haul and although it is not my first choice when flying between Europe and Asia, I would fly again if price is good.",Promoter
First time flying Qatar Airways from Paris CDG to Kuala Lumpur via Doha return. First leg unsatisfactory as the 2-2-2 cabin felt quite cramped. Staff forgot my main course but apologised and this was quickly sorted out. At the lounge in Doha there was a wait for the shower but staff were efficient and I got a shower room within 15 minutes. Doha to Kuala Lumpur was excellent. Great service onboard. Return trip KL to Doha similarly good. However food was at best only average on these flights. Doha to Paris was in first class. On arrival in Doha the lounge was the same as the previous - no separate first class lounge. Another wait to have a shower but this was quick and got a shower room in less than 10 minutes. Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,Passive
" Edinburgh to Dublin in August. Terrible. I only fly Aerlingus if I have no choice due to work. Aer Lingus didn't put my suitcase into the hold, along with 20 others due to space issues. Even though I paid Â£20 for the baggage. They then lied to me several times about the location of my luggage, which contained all my business clothes and medication. Eventually they delivered my suitcase after 4 days, just before I was leaving Dublin to fly home.

Aer Lingus ignored my complaints several times now and eventually promised to send me compensation, which then didn't appear - been waiting 6 weeks now for that.",Detractor

London - Seoul on 777. Check in very friendly staff at the counter. Skyteam lounge in T4 is convenient and airy but the showers were not available as there was no one manning it. On board very courteous cabin crew. They should really change their menu as the food seems to be always the same - Korean bibimbap or beef. The seat turns into a flat bed but it is quite narrow lacks privacy from your neighbor as well as having very little storage space. Lounge in Seoul was big shower facilities were basic and feels like a cheap hotel. Seoul - Osaka short flight with good meal seats the same as long haul flights. Again very courteous cabin crew. One thing about Korean Air is that duty free seems to be a big deal for them they kept on walking around with the catalogue or pushing the trolley around!,Passive

" Stockholm to Bangkok via Delhi. The interior looked rather deteriorated and service was shoddy. The tv was held together with masking tape, and you gotta hold it up yourself! The remote control had no buttons, basically useless, the touch screen was barely working and the remote was dirty. The chair was rough and it snagged my stocking. For each leg of my trip I had to call crew assistance once, and none came until the food was served. Only spicy food was available. Barely any crew service on the 7-hour flight, but on the 3-hour flight they offered refreshments occasionally. I got allergic contact dermatitis on my hands from the soap in the bathroom and I've only had an incident once before, from paint, so there is something very strong in their soap... so I couldn't wash my hands in flight (bags were transferred by the airline so didn't have the chance to get my own soap for the 2nd leg of the flight). Luckily, they had medicine but of course I had to go to their area for help and endure my burning hands, the crew were talking to each other that I had to say ""excuse me"", it almost felt like I was bothering them. They looked at my hands (there were no visible sores, it was just a bit red but it hurt so much) and they took their time. The 2nd leg of the flight was delayed for 1.5 hours, no proper notification and in possibly the worst airport ever. I want to sound impartial but there are really no better words. This is the first time I've flown with them and I can't recommend. I've traveled on LCC many times and not one experience was as unfortunate as this.

Priority lanes for security at both airports provided. Priority boarding honoured. Cabin crew generally friendly. Ample legroom in MCS with free AVOD food and beverages. No hot meals available on short flights. Mood lighting upon boarding was interesting but definitely made it harder to see seat numbers especially on evening or night flights. Both flights generally on time. Can't comment on luggage delivery as I only had carry-on. Overall a great product and definitely the best domestic US airline out there.

LON-HEL-SVX. Flew Finnair a couple of years ago on the same route and I am sorry to say that the quality has dropped even further. No inflight entertainment or anything to help keep the kids occupied. I asked if they had any children activities and was told they didn't do it anymore. The quality of the food is poor for the price I paid I don't think a cold chicken curry sandwich is acceptable. You can of course get nicer food but you have to pay for it. Inflight service on the Helsinki legs was inadequate. I needed to get some water for my boys and my call light was ignored when I finally asked I was told to wait until the trolley came through. The plane only had 2 toilets and when my oldest boy needed the toilet there was a long queue my wife asked to use the business class toilet and after several curt refusals he allowed to use the toilet. There was a general feeling of a lack of care from the IFA's on the flights as if we were annoying them by being on the plane. Service on the Helsinki - Ekaterinburg legs was better but no more than adequate and nowhere near the high standards I was expecting. Finnair is taking on a lot of elements of budget airlines in its ethos and this is starting to filter through with poor in flight service and really poor food.,Passive

"  Paris to Chicago via Keflavik. This is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown on. We were prepared for a cheap flight but not one that cancelled the flight then told you that you were on your own and they couldn't get you home for ten days. On top of this they have no customer Service whatsoever. The help that they have are contracted labor and are given and are allowed to only do boarding passes and luggage tags no other no abilities - except to use the same line for every canceled flight. That Line is ""someone died on the flight the day before so we had to cancel all flights"". So they canceled three days of flights told us we were on our own and they couldn't fly us out until 10 days later. Be aware you will get dumped on and left in some foreign port. Fancy airlines uniforms down make good customer service.

" A few days ago I found a fare from Chicago to West Palm Beach. It was $172.55 round trip. I selected it and provided my credit card for the purchase. About 2 hours later I was informed that my fare had increased by $85.00. They did provide me with other dates that would be at my original quote. I was told that the reservation can take up to 24 hours to ticket and within that time frame the fare is subject to change. I provided a credit card based on the flights I selected yet they changed my fare. That's what I call a bait & switch. My experience with other major airlines (UA, AA, Delta) is what I booked is what I get charged. But Spirit has this 24 hour timeframe in place which allows them to arbitraily change your fare if you still want the route you originally selected. What a racket. My advise is stay away from Spirit. Better yet run. Their practices are deceptive. Don't forget about all the add on charges. The cost to carry on you bag is more than that to check it. If I carry my own bag on board am I not saving the cost of a luggage handler. And if you prefer to select your seat ahead of time that will cost you too. You are required to pay for all beverages. By the time you pay for the ticket (at the price they choose - not you) and add on all the additional fees plan on spending about $100 more than what you paid for the ticket",Detractor

After some hours I had to go by myself on the back of the plane to ask them for some drinks and a little snack (since the meal itself wasn't even that big, not even for an economy class meal). Besides the fact that the flight attendant didn't even care about us and not even bothered to smile, two of four toilets were not working. After mealtime many people had of course the need to go to the restroom - with a waiting time of sometimes over 15 mins. I guess that's why they didn't serve as much drink as they maybe usually do? What disturbed me most is that the crew or the maitre the cabine didn't greet the passengers at the beginning of the flight or informed us about the failure of the toilets. Just the captain mentioned it 1 hour before landing, and thanked us for our understanding. The overall experience of Austrian is cheap service with lousy flight attendants and bad maintenanced aircrafts.",Detractor
"  Guilin to Beijing. This daily flight seemed to be the best connection to Europe, with a stopover in Beijing, but I was truly mistaken to make that assumption. The flight was two hours late, no staff was present to explain why (even in Chinese) and practically no food was served on the flight (except dry bread with something that was heavily processed meat) - not great since the wait in the airport was so long that I got hungry. The worst though was that according to my lounge staff the flight is always one hot late, it has never been in time, which is not what official Air China statistics say. This was my last time with Air China.",Detractor
"Delta Air Lines business class from London LHR to New York JFK. Smooth checkin at T3 - I could not checkin on line, as if you are not an US Citizen or travel with Visa Waiver, but have a visa, you cannot checkin online - ridiculous. Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse was amazing and a pleasure to use. Boeing 767-400 has 1-2-1 configuration in Business Class, but seat is quite hard and very narrow, especially when reclined - it is hard to move when you sleep. Cabin crew was quite young and very friendly. Boiling hot hot towels (some passengers drop them on the floor, as it was hard to hold it). Surprisingly good food, average wine list (I'd expect more American wines), but Delta Sunrise Signature Cocktail was a hit. Excellent dessert cart. Very disappointing IFE - no blockbuster hits, just a few new movies, TV shows I've never heard of - simply, there was nothing to watch. Because of some turbulence there was no second service. Arrived on time. Generally, decent product, better than expected, very nice crew, but nothing special to remember except signature cocktail which was a hit.",Promoter
" Chicago to Las Vegas. It is by far the worst experience. Do not get baited with the low price flight. It'll be guaranteed to be delayed, terminals at the farthest corner in the airport and with any bag, pretty much out price the mid tier airlines.

"I flew from Minneapolis to St Thomas USVI with a layover in Ft Lauderdale round trip this past week. All 4 flights were delayed. When we were going to Ft Lauderdale from Minneapolis, the plane was an hour delayed with no explanation or even notification. Every time we checked online it was the flight was ""on time"". We were supposed to take off around midnight but didn't leave til closer to 1:45 AM. Once we finally got home back to Minneapolis after our plane was delayed over 2 hours in FLL, we didn't get back until around 3am and it took about 20 min for the luggage to finally start coming down. I will never fly this airline again. They advertise cheap prices so you book the flight seeing the initial price. Then you have to pay for everything, from picking your seat to having a carry on item. When its all said and done you might as well fly a bigger airline. Not worth the cheap prices.",Detractor

" New York to Sarasota. After travelling 30+ hours from Nepal on Qatar Airways with my two kids, I had a connecting flight on Jetblue to Tampa. What should have been a 3 hrs. fight, turned into a 5 days ordeal. We were on the Initial flight on the 22nd of July which left the gate and then after being in the tarmac for 3 hrs, they returned us back to the terminal because the delay caused one of the crew to be above legal flying time allowed. Our initial flight was eventually cancelled at around 2:00 AM the next day and they gave no compensation citing the cancellation was because of weather. I had to be in the line for more than an hour to book our flights for the next day. I was told we were booked for the next day flight, but when we reached the gate the next day, they told us we didn't have any confirmed seats in any of the JetBlue flights. Same thing happened for a couple of days. Finally, after 4 days, they gave me an option to fly out to Sarasota. In between, they told me they had misplaced my luggage and was asked for me to find out where my luggage was. So, after 5 days, without any luggage, they put me in a flight to a different destination and to top it off, they put us in completely different areas of the aircraft and while I was trying to console my 7-year-old to go sit with a stranger, the flight attendant asks us to take our seat promptly. Please do not fly JetBlue, because they have zero passenger concern, they seriously need to fire the guy who manages the flights and reorganize. They were completely disorganized, desk and the person on the phone telling me I had confirmed flights, while the gate told me I didn't have any. Baggage getting lost and they had no clue where it was last scanned, rude desk people. Complete chaos.",Detractor
Return leg from BKK-AGP. As with the outbound all flights ran slightly early. Staff again professional and efficient and some friendlier than the normal Swiss staff. The Cabin Manger was very attentive and spoke to all passengers individually over dinner (interestingly he was in fact Spanish). Dinner as on the outbound was very good and as a late night departure quickly served which was appreciated. Fully flat beds again which is normal for the A340 and woken the usual 90 minutes prior to landing for a (very poor) breakfast which let this flight down. Could not find the arrivals lounge at Zurich but not important as has a shower at the departure lounge while waiting for the second flight. Again no complaints a full lunch with champagne served despite being 10.30am but acceptable as being awake for many hours and travelling in a different time zone.

We flew Toronto to Dublin when booking the flight it was simply Air Canada it wasn't until we were boarding we saw the air hostesses wearing those ridiculous trilby hats that I realised something wasn't quite right. Safe to say the worst flight I have been on. Very unprofessional staff the food was cold and horrible. Neither me nor my boyfriend ate it. The planes are very cramped and the seats are terribly uncomfortable. I definitely would not recommend them for a long haul flight. I paid $1200 to be squished in a seat for almost 8 hours with a rented tablet and a headphone dock that didn't work. Also when you usually travel with any airline you expect a certain level of professionalism in how the staff not only act but how they dress Air Canada Rouge staff look very scruffy.

Crew on my side of the aisle were courteous, once again acknowledging my Emerald status, however on my friends side the attendant basically barked at her, and at Cathay they have a trend of screaming â€˜mind your knees' as they pull the cart up the aisle seemed very unprofessional. The Pier lounge at Hong Kong was outstanding. No Emerald recognition on the LGW sector, crew seemed very new and unsure of their role, I think Cathay's more â€˜Senior crew' work in the premium cabins. I really don't understand after 4 long sectors how this airline has reached 5 star status, it really is let down by poor inflight service.

"Very stressful and unhelpful Emirates ground/check-in service overall on my New York to Dubai trip. Chaotic with the limousine service in New York. Really bad reception in Dubai trying to get a hotel voucher and visa through Emirates ground service. Lady at desk gave me a bunch of papers and asked me to go to the bank around the corner, where the papers were stamped. Then I went back to the first point only to be told that there was no need to return I could go through passport control! Maybe tell that, so people do not have to go back/forth. At JFK check in, I asked about an upgrade to first class. ""Sorry, I do not know how to do that!"" was the reply. Maybe ask someone how? After printing boarding cards I asked her again if she could find out about upgrading (Emirates had an upgrade offer for points on the day). She left and came back saying it could not be done - I suspect because she had already given me the boarding cards. Of course it turned out that there were empty first class seats available on the flight. Flights uneventful - but very disappointing overall.",Detractor

Round trip between LAX to MEL on business trip for approximately 16 hours in the economy section at the window (to MEL) and aisle (to LAX) seat with price tag of $2660 USD. Overall experience in seating was not pleasant rather painful experience. 1) Leg room space appears to be one of the smallest of all the planes I have traveled with. This leg room issue is made worse by the passenger in front of you if (s)he pushes the recliner back. With the recliner pushed back there is little space to enjoy the food. No wonder the movie monitor has great viewing tilt angle (top-bottom) as the screen gets so close to your face. 2) There is a rectangular shape power box on the floor between the middle seat and the aisle seat which forces your leg to be tilted while resting. You will need to place your foot at an off angle. (4) Rest room was very small so small that I couldn't even bend over to wash my face. No more Qantas!,Detractor

I don't blame them for the delay totally, but it did contribute to my attitude towards Jetblue on the return flight. The flight up was cold even though it was winter. They decided that AC was a good idea during winter. ""Great idea"". Snacks were good though. On the return flight, we were scheduled for a nice afternoon/evening flight, but Jetblue decided to take our plane away from us, fly it to JFK for another flight which they thought was more important than ours, and left us sitting in the terminal for 3-4 more hours.

From Adelaide to Singapore and return in A330-300 Singapore to London and return in A380. The A330 was reasonably new on the way up but an older rattler coming back. Also I don't understand when you leave Singapore at midnight why you only have a choice of three main dishes? After a few hours in the Silver Kris lounge all I wanted was a snack such as cheese & biscuits or a sandwich - with a glass of Bollinger to help send me to sleep! It's a less than 7-hour flight with a big tailwind so why over-cater? Both A380 flights were impeccable. Even smarter service going up than coming back. Wonderful to have a lie-flat and a hectare of room to sleep in and a functional wide- choice IFE.

"Due to non functioning baggage conveyer belt, the departure from Dammam was delayed, resulting in missing A380 connecting flight to Barcelona. Emirates put me in a hotel to wait for the next flight. Next flight was on new Boeing 777-300ER, the IFE screen is sharp, hi-res picture quality, thin and light. I was allocated a seat 24H which is an exit row seat, better legroom. I think a way of saying sorry for the misconnection that I had. IFE system is the best, food is generous. I'd rather less food but better quality. Avoid using Tourico Holidays, a company associated with Emirates, they cancelled my hotel reservation without even notifying me. The first cancellation, I was told to enter my physical address to avoid cancellation. I rebooked thru them the second time with physical address. Arriving in Barcelona hotel, shocked to be told that the hotel reservation is cancelled again, although my credit card was charged (apparently refunded), but no email to notify me that it has been cancelled by tourico. Nasty company. If you want to be stranded in a foreign city without any accommodation. Please do your booking with Tourico. You would see this company, if you purchase your ticket on Emirates website. A company such as Emirates should not associate themselves with this shoddy company. Avoid Tourico.",Passive
"  18/6/2017, Zurich - Amsterdam and 21/6/2017, Amsterdam - Zurich. The flight from ZRH to AMS was about two hours late, not the Airlines fault. The return flight was on time. Both flights were comfortable, safe and a nice experience. The flight from AMS back to ZRH was extremely comfortable because it was only about half full. Both flights were about 60 to 65 minutes, so the lack of IFE does not bother me. Free Sandwich and a glass of Apple Juice. Will recommend Swiss Int'l Airlines to anyone. I paid CHF 101 all inclusive.

" Dubai to Frankfurt. I upgrade from Premium economy to Business by cash - this was smooth via LH homepage. As I am Star Alliance Gold I used the SEN lounge in Dubai - LH offers a consistent lounge product but food & beverages are very average in Dubai- if at all. At least the lounge is nicely furnished. Boarding was quick and the ""Old Lady 747"" was full in business. The seat is comfortable - but it offers no/limited privacy and on the lower deck it has an outdated 2-3-2 configuration - can it get any worse? Their sister airlines Swiss and Austrian offer a much better layout already. Anyhow I got a good sleep for almost 5h as the seat converts in a fully flat bed. I waived the late dinner and had only the breakfast - unfortunately nothing to remember. The inflight entertainment is technically advanced - the selection on music is the worst from all airlines I have flown. The movies though are OK. Overall the experience is OK - but far away from 5 star.",Passive

"Newark to Glasgow via Reykjavik, and Icelandair is is a an airline that has overextended itself. The flight to Glasgow was without incident aside of a small delay due to labor action by air traffic comptrollers. The return trip was different. The delay in Glasgow was beyond that airlines control, but the chaos that occurred in Keflavik could have been avoided. All flights to North America were delayed and boarding was chaotic. For an airline touting itself as a good alternative to Europe, they seem to have not been able to handle the volume well. Once on the plane, the flight was smooth, service good.

Sydney to Seoul on 777. Seats were wide and comfortable for economy and reclined enough to sleep. Shortly after take- off FAs gave out various small amenities and slippers which I found useful to walk around on the plane. Hot towels and menues were given before breakfast and the food was the best I have had on any flight. Beverages were served regularly with FAs offering water and juice. The IFE was good for me but screens were the older style PTV. Staff service was a standout. FAs were efficient and fast when called.,Promoter
Shanghai - Yantai in Business Class. Flight on a new A320 aircraft - the Business Class section actually has larger seats with more legroom compared to many short haul business class cabins so had a feeling that you are actually getting something extra for your money. Seats in 4-abreast configuration in the business section and very comfortable. Hot meal was served with soft drinks tea and coffee but no alcoholic beverages offered (which I didn't mind as it was a lunchtime flight and I had an afternoon meeting to attend). It is also worth pointing out that you have priority going through security which is an advantage during busy times. There was access to a lounge close to the gate which was basic by western standards but adequate. Whilst some aspects of the service would be considered basic by Western standards I am told by my Chinese colleague who made the arrangements that Business class domestic fares in China are quite competitive.,Promoter
" Seoul to Prague. Check in very fast. Was seated in the upper deck of the 747-8i. Amazing aircraft, the prestige suites are very private, and the extra storage along the window is most welcome. The cabin was spotlessly clean, and two bathrooms upstairs is a plus as most airlines only have one. Cabin Crew are very professional and friendly, and always immaculately presented. The food was of good standard. The entertainment is a bit limited, however that doesn't really bother me as I do not use the IFE that much. ICN is a great airport, although the Korean air lounge isn't really worth a visit, they should invest more into their lounges. Overall a great experience, Korean Air is one of the more premium airlines to fly.",Promoter

No inflight entertainment at all both operated by A320's whose seats were looking just a little tired. The biggest gripe I have is the food on the business flight we had some sandwiches which were bordering on being stale and on the return trip was a cold chicken wrap which was very short on imagination. Quite disappointed that the food appears to have gone downhill badly since our last flights. Come on BA these are the sorts of things which gave you a clear lead over most of your rivals.,Passive

"  Air India from Mumbai to Bangalore return. I was a bit skeptical of the timings as they tend to reschedule a lot based on others experiences. However, my both flights were close to schedule, with a slight 20-min delay which is common when flying in and out of Mumbai. The best part of the flight was surprisingly, the crew who were mostly young and going out of their way on the service front. Food was decent too. I got to fly on the classic A320 on the return leg, which was old but a nice memory for sure. Their seats/leg room is better than other Indian carriers, especially if one happens to be above 6ft. The only glitch I faced from them was for the seat selection, which I had selected for both flights, but at checkin found I was on different seats for both legs. The overall experience however was pleasant, with both the nice and swank BOMT2 and BLR terminals.",Promoter

There were individual screens, however, these were old too: small, responded slowly, and it took 1.5h and two resets until the entertainment system in the aircraft finally worked. The catering was average. We liked, however, that even in economy class you can get champagne. The flight attendants seemed genuinely friendly and did they work very well.",Passive

" Charleston to Newark. I have flown with United for 4 years consistently now and have never had such a horrible experience as today. Customer service was terrible, no help was given, and no solution so I am now flying Delta. I arrived almost an hour and half before my flight - at 5:30am, bags paid for online and check in online done. All I needed to do was put my bags on the flight and get on security line - the line was so long that they pushed the 6:50am flight customers to the front, but when one woman complained about it, they sent us back and said that the flights would stand by for us since so many of us were on those flights. Being sent to the back of the line made me not get to security until 6:25am, with boarding ending at 6:30am. Furious no one could help me or would, and I managed to run to the gate and miss my flight by 5 minutes. I planned according as I have done for every single flight I have ever taken out of Charleston, and missed my flight because of incompetence and the disregard of United and airport employees. When I called to try and book another flight the representative was also extremely unhelpful only offering the most expensive routes or flights for tomorrow when I needed to be home today. When we mentioned I would be taking Delta he started badmouthing Delta and how it would be better to take United - rude, unhelpful, and disrespectful.

LHR â€“ DOH â€“ MAA return on 21st â€“ 31st December '14. I flew the same route with Qatar in 2011 and was really impressed with the service at the time so was looking forward to the same thing this time travelling with my wife. On the day of our departure I was somewhat disappointed that due to a change of plane from A340 to A330 on the LHR-DOH leg my reserved seats no longer applied and we were stuck over the wing however we had at least been given seats together. It's fair to say that our impression of Qatar's in-flight experience for the whole of the first three legs (that is to Chennai and back to Doha on return) was good. All were on A330s (either -200 or -300s). The planes were comfortable with good leg-room (although beware of the entertainment box which takes up half the foot-space for all window seats) the cabin crew were attentive polite and friendly the food was impressively above average â€“ all the seats seemed to have been refurbished on our planes and were comfortable. As for the new Doha airport even though we only had a 1 hour transit each way it was clearly outstanding with plenty of space to relax use the internet watch TV and many shops albeit expensive ones. Overall the impression was very good though I would have said it had lost that real supreme feel that had so impressed me in 2011. Then on our final leg from Doha â€“ Heathrow I had managed to book this leg on the new A380. Suddenly the wow-factor returned! By some distance the best flight we have ever taken! Our seats had again been changed but boy were we glad! Between booking and flying I'd joined the Qatar Privilege Club and we'd been moved to the small economy section at the back of the top deck which had been fully blocked out when I reserved seats. Instead of 3-4-3 seating it's 2-4-2 and the experience was great. Comfortable seats lots of legroom big HD quality IFE screens fantastic service from 2 dedicated cabin crew and 2 toilets for just 8 rows of seats storage box next to the window complimentary mini amenity kit for all economy passengers and of course that great feeling of walking up the stairs inside the plane to reach our seats.
